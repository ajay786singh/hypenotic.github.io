<p>Lake Gananoque is approximately located where 5 forests meet, where the 401 has 4 lanes, and where one prehistoric fish lives.</p>

<p>Many have seen the forests and travelled on the 401, but only man has seen the fish. His name was Jake Brennan. Jake was a famous fishing guide from Gananoque. The fish he caught were the type you stuffed and hung on the wall, because no one would believe you otherwise. The greatest fish that Jake ever caught only gave him a scale to show for it, but people believed his story anyways. Perhaps Jake was just that good of a fisherman.</p>

<p>Jake was on the water one day, casting his line, when the giant bit. The fish was too strong for him to reel in. Instead Jake hung on to the line, and as the hours passed, he waited for the fish to die. Maybe the fish was waiting for Jake to die too, however in the meantime it worked on an escape plan. The fish extracted itself from the lure, and left just one scale behind. After all the rage and disappointment passed, Jake examined the scale, hoping to find some clue as to who his opponent was. On it was a ring pattern that suggested the fish came from prehistoric times. Jake returned to town to tell his story, and the great fish was named Old Moss Back.</p>

<p>Old Moss Back is believed to currently live near the banks of the St. Lawrence River.</p>
