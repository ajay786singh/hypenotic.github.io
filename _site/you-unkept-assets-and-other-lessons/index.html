  <p><a rel="attachment wp-att-4036" href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/4033/you-unkept-assets-and-other-lessons/attachment/screen-shot-2011-01-17-at-11-20-17-pm"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4036" title="Screen shot 2011-01-17 at 11.20.17 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-01-17-at-11.20.17-PM.png" alt="" width="511" height="404" /></a>This morning, with one eye open sipping espresso, I found this in my &#8220;My Daily Deal&#8221; from <a href="http://livingsocial.com/deals/18358-brazilian-wax?msdc_id=53&amp;ref=TORDeal011711_53_4666email">Living Social</a> in my inbox. Living Social is one of the many websites offering &#8220;deeply discounted&#8221; deals at local businesses.  This &#8220;Daily Deal&#8221; was for a discounted Brazilian wax.</p>

<p>I would like to ask the women readers if this description of your vaginal area (That&#8217;s right I said vaginal area. And I can say vagina too!) sounds accurate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Diamonds may be a girl&#8217;s best friend, but when they&#8217;re in the rough they can be prickly to the touch &#8212; just like your unkempt assets. Here&#8217;s a pearl of wisdom: when you snag today&#8217;s edge-smoothing Brazilian wax from La Perla Salon &amp; Spa for $25 (regularly $60), you&#8217;ll be as happy as a clam. Enjoy a complimentary cappuccino or mineral water while you wait for your appointment; then treat your treasure to this stubble-removing service, selecting either hard or soft wax. Located near Eaton Centre, this lux downtown spa and its team of talented technicians will have you cleaned and polished faster than you can compress a karat&#8217;s worth of carbon.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, how many vagina metaphors can there be in one single ad? Apparently my vagina is a diamond. An unkempt asset. A clam. A treasure.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to remind <a href="http://laperla.sites.toronto.com/">La Perla Salon and Spa</a> of the following tenet; <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/remarkable-marketing-story/">&#8220;Know Your Audience&#8221; is rule #1 </a>of content creation.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s try and get inside the mind of a woman who wants a Brazilian wax, shall we?</p>

<p>How do women who get Brazilian waxes think about their bodies? What is the trigger motivating them to remove all of their pubic hair? For the sake of transparency I&#8217;ll say I&#8217;ve always found the practice to seem rooted in sexism. But that&#8217;s a conversation for another day, and for the purposes of this post, really besides the point.</p>

<p>The question is, what does the Brazilian &#8220;do&#8221; for the woman who gets one? Because it must do something in order for her to endure this rather unpleasant process.</p>

<p>Consider the following possible options:</p>

<ul>
<li>  It makes her feel &#8216;together&#8217; like a manicure or a haircut. It makes her feel like she&#8217;s on her game.</li>
<li>  It makes her feel pretty, sexy, attractive for herself.</li>
<li>  Same as above for her partner who she aims to please.</li>
<li>  It enhances her sex life.</li>
</ul>

<p>No matter which insight you think is the right one, in the mind of the &#8216;waxee&#8217; there&#8217;s a pay-off for getting a Brazilian. It makes her feel good and somehow empowered.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there is nothing empowering about referring to a woman&#8217;s vagina as a &#8220;diamond in the rough&#8221; or her &#8220;unkempt asset.&#8221; in fact, it makes her body seem like something solely to be consumed by others. Not to mention the fact that if a woman views her vagina as a treasure, it doesn&#8217;t become disgusting the moment it&#8217;s less than hairless.</p>

<p>Now, let&#8217;s look at a great ad that takes on one of these insights&#8211;that it makes women feel more &#8220;together&#8221; and more attractive to be waxed. The ad avoids being &#8216;judgey&#8217; like the Brazilian copy does&#8211;it says having a neat bikini line is you, but better. And it makes a point of embracing all possible options in the self-grooming category.</p>

<p>Have a peek.</p>
