        Nestle Funds Research to Further Confuse Parents

    <span class="post-date">25 Oct 2010</span>

    <p><a rel="attachment wp-att-3717" href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/3716/gerber-and-nestle-release-research-to-further-confuse-parents/attachment/screen-shot-2010-10-25-at-3-34-56-pm"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3717" title="Screen shot 2010-10-25 at 3.34.56 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-25-at-3.34.56-PM.png" alt="" width="343" height="203" /></a></p>

<p>So, Nestlé put out a research report called the <a href="http://www.foodpolitics.com/2010/10/toddler-eating-patterns-the-latest-survey/">Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study </a>(FITS).  The study generally concludes that infant nutrition is improving, but Toddlers are not well fed. Before turning to the study&#8217;s findings, let us consider why Nestlé would fund and publish this particular piece of research.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a little factoid you might not know. Nestlé acquired <a href="http://www.gerber.com/Public/Default.aspx">Gerber </a>in 2007. Hmmm&#8230;</p>

<p>Gerber has always been big in the baby food world. But like all good food companies, Gerber needs to grow and be profitable. There are only so many babies born each year.  They need more &amp; newer revenue streams.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14.4px;">Can you just imagine  Nestlé execs sitting around contemplating &#8220;H<em>ow can we extend Gerber&#8217;s ubiquity beyond infancy</em>?&#8221; &#8221; OH!  OH! OH! I know.&#8221; says one astute young brand executive  &#8220;Let&#8217;s make toddler foods and market them to parents&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14.4px;">One problem. Toddlers don&#8217;t need pre-made food. They can just eat regular &#8220;people&#8221; food. Or can they?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14.4px;">Here&#8217;s the idea. Gerber convinces parents that they need Gerber to guide their choices around </span><span style="font-size: 14.4px;">food because nowadays food  is too complicated an issue for parents to be able to understand let alone <em>manage</em> on their own.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14.4px;">While folks like <a href="http://michaelpollan.com/books/food-rules/">Michael Pollan</a> are trying to keep it simple (&#8220;Eat real food. Not too much. Mostly plants&#8221;) Nestlé is trying to keep things complicated. Real complicated. </span></p>

<p>And so, Gerber now makes Toddler foods like this clever <a href="http://www.gerber.com/Toddler/Products/PASTA_PICK_UPS.aspx?PLineId=7510b910-e601-4a5c-97b2-331b4ce33e5b&amp;PCatId=9772c526-b81c-45a2-80c7-dd7893122bea&amp;PMilestoneId=98fef2e2-431f-4082-a5f2-0f17226b14b7">microwavable ravioli</a>, just the right size for toddler&#8217;s hands. They&#8217;ve even segued into pre-schooler foods like the super duper nutritious <a href="http://www.gerber.com/Preschooler/Products/Preschooler_Juice_Treats.aspx">&#8220;juice treats.&#8221;</a> All with the right amount of fat, calories, sodium. It&#8217;s like <a href="http://www.leancuisine.com/Index/Index.aspx">Lean Cuisine </a>(also owned by Nestlé) for kids.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re not convinced that Nestlé/Gerber are hell bent on making food seem utterly complicated, check out the <a href="http://www.gerber.com/Public/Default.aspx">Gerber website</a>. Apparently sitters, crawlers and walkers all have different nutritional needs. Check out this handy dandy <a href="http://www.gerber.com/Toddler/Nutrition_And_Feeding/shsh_nutrition_101.aspx">nutrition glossary</a>. That thing has more information about food than any parent would ever want to know.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14.4px;">Ok. so back to the research findings of the FIT study. Here&#8217;s some of what we learned:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14.4px;"> </span></p>

<ul>
<li>  <span style="font-size: 14.4px;">71% of toddlers and 84% of preschoolers consume more sodium than recommended on a given day.</span></li>
<li>  25% of older infants, toddlers and preschoolers do not eat even one serving of fruit on a given day, and 30% do not eat a single serving of vegetables.</li>
<li>  A small but important number of older infants are not getting enough iron. Twelve percent of children from six-to-11 months of age are not getting enough iron on a given day.</li>
<li>  French fries are still the most popular vegetable among toddlers and preschoolers.</li>
</ul>

<p>So what&#8217;s the solution? Clearly to feed your kids (a.k.a &#8220;The Gerber Generation&#8221;) more of the &#8220;patent pending&#8221; scientifically rendered microwavable food in the plastic container. Clearly.</p>

<p>If you think this makes any sense my friends, I&#8217;d like to enrol you in a research study of my own, also coincidentally called the FITS study (an acronym for Food Is The Shit) researching why parents can&#8217;t figure out what to feed their kids to raise them healthy. Come on people. Anyone heard of carrots?</p>

<p>And now, for your amusement, a little Gerber ad featuring the many faces of &#8220;Gerber generation&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14.4px;">is all about kids up to 5 years of age:<span style="font-size: 17.28px;"></span></span></p>
