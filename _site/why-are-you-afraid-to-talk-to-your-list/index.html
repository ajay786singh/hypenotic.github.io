<p style="text-align: center;">
  I was recently helping a client set up the <a title="Customizing Email Signup Forms in MailChimp" href="http://blog.mailchimp.com/customizing-email-signup-forms-in-mailchimp/">email newsletter capture form</a> for their website.
</p>

<p>The client has a hyper-networked role, often attending conferences, presenting workshops and travelling to make connections and extend the reach and relevance of their organization.</p>

<p>The list of things they hoped to learn about their subscribers was considerable.</p>

<ul>
<li>  Name,</li>
<li>  Email address,</li>
<li>  City,</li>
<li>  Organizational affiliation,</li>
<li>  Professional affiliation,</li>
<li>  And much more.</li>
</ul>

<p>We agreed this was putting up a barrier to participation. That the more fields we put in the form, <a href="http://blog.kissmetrics.com/increase-user-sign-ups/" title="5 simple tips to help you increase user sign ups">the less likely people will be to sign up</a>.</p>

<p>Given the nature of the client&#8217;s organization this information would be extremely valuable. And they hoped many would be happy to share it.</p>

<p>I think this presents a valuable opportunity for a marketer, as I&#8217;ll explain in a minute.</p>

<p>But first, realize that people don&#8217;t care about your newsletter. They don&#8217;t want to be on your list.</p>

<p>What they want is to get to know you better; to be part of your community; to gain insight and knowledge; to get the inside scoop.</p>

<p>They&#8217;re looking for value and connection.</p>

<p>Derek Halpern of Social Triggers <a href="http://socialtriggers.com/what-do-people-buy/" title="Derek Halpern on what people buy">shares</a> how he gauges what his customers want to buy. He replies to every email subscription with the questionâ€¦</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;What are you struggling with?&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The question goes out by autoresponder, of course. He doesn&#8217;t write each of these emails individually. But he genuinely wants to know, and he responds to every reply he gets.</p>

<p>The point is, he&#8217;s engaging his followers in dialogue. He&#8217;s demonstrating interest in their needs and showing his commitment to create real value.</p>

<p>Value and connection. That&#8217;s why people are on your list.</p>

<p>With the help of the <a href="http://mailchimp.com/features/autoresponders/" title="MailChimp autoresponder features">autoresponder</a> built right into MailChimp (or whatever email provider you use) you can start a dialogue right now that invites connection.</p>

<p>Whether you&#8217;re selling, or growing a community of like-minded activists.</p>

<p>Instead of making people jump through hoops to get a dry impersonal email, your newsletter could be the beginning of a long and mutually fruitful relationship.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d love to hear whether you&#8217;ve tried anything like this. And where it&#8217;s taken you. Please share below.</p>
