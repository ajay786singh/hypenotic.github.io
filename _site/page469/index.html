        Come on Wendy’s: Get Real

    <p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1620" title="Screen shot 2010-01-05 at 11.26.55 AM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Screen-shot-2010-01-05-at-11.26.55-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2010-01-05 at 11.26.55 AM" width="637" height="355" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptHgHgzIItU"></a>Wendy&#8217;s has recently launched the <a href="http://www.wendysrealtime.com/#/real-videos">You Know When it&#8217;s Real </a>campaign. The campaign uses <em>real</em> in two senses of the word; Real because it exploits real time features like a <a href="http://www.wendysrealtime.com/#/real-time">Twitter feed </a> and a <a href="http://www.wendysrealtime.com/#/real-videos">video contest</a> and real in terms of freshness and quality product.</p>

<p>In terms of the first use of the term real, the campaign&#8217;s social media features are random. None of the content is useful, shareworthy or connected to the broader campaign idea. I would put this in the camp of social media for social media&#8217;s sake and not in support of a broader idea.</p>

<p>In it&#8217;s other use of the term <em>real</em> Wendy&#8217;s is striving to stand apart from the fast-food pack by focusing on the fact that the burgers are not frozen and that they are handmade. The campaign features a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptHgHgzIItU">series of ads</a> highlighting their idea of real-ness with fun visuals and music.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s take pause and consider Wendy&#8217;s use of the term real. We are in a particular moment in the food-zeitgeist. Michael Pollan&#8217;s best-selling <a href="http://www.michaelpollan.com/omnivore.php">Ominvore&#8217;s Dilemma </a>was recently named one of New York Times&#8217; and Washington Post&#8217;s 10 best books of the year. The book&#8217;s thesis boils down to Pollan&#8217;s opening quote &#8220;Eat Real Food. Not too much. Mostly plants.&#8221;  This is not a marginal book. And, this is not a marginal movement. And this quote is very, very sticky.</p>

<p>Beyond Pollan, consider the following; The film <a href="http://www.foodincmovie.com/">Food Inc. </a> (now available at a video store near you) has brought the issue of factory farming to the mainstream. The super campy and accessible tone of <a href="http://www.skinnybitch.net/about.html">Skinny Bitch</a> involves calling meat eating &#8220;The Dead, Rotting, Decomposing Flesh Diet.&#8221; Marginal? Well, Skinny Bitch continues to be a huge hit and has been #1 on the The New York Times&#8217; bestselling list. More recently, Alicia Silverstone&#8217;s new vegan cookbook is called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kind-Diet-Simple-Feeling-Losing/dp/1605296449">The Kind Diet</a> and talks at length about the impact of factory farming on the planet. New York Times columnist and mega-cookbook author Mark Bittman&#8217;s latest book is called <a href="http://www.markbittman.com/books/food-matters">Food Matters</a> and like the others I&#8217;ve mentioned, shines a light on factory meat and it&#8217;s impact on the health of humans and the planet.</p>

<p>Phew. So back to Wendy&#8217;s. In light of this conversation, what marketing genius thought calling Wendy&#8217;s meat real on the basis that it&#8217;s not frozen would satisfy consumers&#8217; hunger for real food? Have a look at the website. Some of their big claims under the <a href="http://www.wendysrealtime.com/#/fresh-facts">Fresh Facts</a> tab are that their tomatoes are hand sliced daily, their lettuce (iceberg!) is hand-leafed (what?) and the delivery truck makes lots of deliveries. Wow. I&#8217;m feeling a little un-impressed.</p>

<p>Calling yourself real sets the bar pretty high. In fact the ads rely on images of Abe Lincoln, the Statue of Liberty and flashes a mock Declaration of Freshness. One blog takes an obvious stab at Wendy&#8217;s idea  real by showing what a <a href="http://abesauer.com/2009/10/22/wendys-ad-fail-you-know-when-its-real-and-it-never-is/">real Wendy&#8217;s burger looks like </a>compared to the glossy image on the website.</p>

<p>Several years ago <a href="http://www.chipotle.com/#/land">Chipotle</a> took on a similar positioning with the tagline &#8220;Food With Integrity.&#8221; But, as it is described on the website, it is not just a positioning, it is  &#8220;a philosophy that we can always do better in terms of the food we buy.&#8221; Real food is Chipotle&#8217;s reality, not just their positioning. They back it up with credible business practices summed up in a compelling, galvanizing <a href="http://www.chipotle.com/#/flash/fwi_story">Manifesto.</a> And, they actually support the principles of <a href="http://www.chipotle.com/#/flash/fwi_food-inc">Food Inc.</a> and encourage people to watch the film. Why? Because as the CEO says &#8220;The more people know where their food comes from, the more they&#8217;ll appreciate what we do.&#8221;</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re going to conjure up Abe Lincoln and the Statue of Liberty and singing a jingle with the lyrics &#8220;Our philosophy, is good old honesty,&#8221; you&#8217;d better be able to back it up. And in this case, Wendy&#8217;s can&#8217;t.</p>
