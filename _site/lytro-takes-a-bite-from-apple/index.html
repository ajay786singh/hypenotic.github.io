  <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7335" title="Lytro Red Camera" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Lytro-red-camera.jpg" alt="Lytro Red Camera" width="576" height="368" />
</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a sexy piece of technology and if you haven&#8217;t already heard of the game changing Lytro cameras you will soon. Lytro just unveiled a line of &#8220;light field&#8221; cameras that capture more colour, intensity and light per shot than traditional cameras. That makes for more vibrant photos, but most importantly, it allows users to change the focus within an image after it&#8217;s been taken. That&#8217;s right, you focus <em>after</em> you&#8217;ve taken the shot. (You can play around with how it all works on<a title="Lytro Demo" href="https://www.lytro.com/living-pictures/282" target="_blank"> Lytro&#8217;s site</a>.)</p>

<p>The camera is elongated with a rectangular shape. The lens is on one end and a LCD touch-screen display on the other. Power and shutter buttons, a USB port, and a touch-sensitive strip to move through its 8X zoom range are arranged along the sides. It boasts 8 gigs of storage and comes in 3 colours. Oh yeah, one more thing, they&#8217;ve included a social feature so that you can instantly share to Facebook.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7341" title="Lytro sticks out from the crowd" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/cm-capture-13.jpg" alt="Lytro sticks out from the crowd" width="576" height="366" />
</p>

<p>Besides the revolutionary technology inside the camera, what is really striking is the design of the camera itself. The device looks nothing like a traditional point-and-shoot. It&#8217;s simple, clean, user-friendly and well, Apple-esque. If it had a metallic casing and the Apple icon you might even think that is was part of the Apple product lineup. Even browsing <a href="https://www.lytro.com/">Lytro&#8217;s site</a>, you can see elements of Apple in the sites use of colours, whitespace, gradients and simple actions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aesthetically pleasing objects appear to the user to be more effective, by virtue of their sensual appeal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just like Apple, you can see the thought that went into the design and how we might want/need to interact with it. It&#8217;s not only a product based on the principles of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_Design">emotional design</a>, it&#8217;s also a company that seems to have adopted and pushed Apple&#8217;s &#8220;Think Different&#8221; mantra into the photography space. And like the iPad, a product we didn&#8217;t know we needed until we held it in our hands, Lytro seems to have achieved the same thing.</p>

<p>To capture the complexity of &#8220;light field&#8221; technology and place it within a simple design is a pretty amazing thing. And as Steve Jobs said, &#8220;simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.&#8221;</p>
