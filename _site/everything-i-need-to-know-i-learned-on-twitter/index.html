  <p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1996" title="Screen shot 2010-02-11 at 2.24.49 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Screen-shot-2010-02-11-at-2.24.49-PM1.png" alt="Screen shot 2010-02-11 at 2.24.49 PM" width="272" height="169" />There are many great resources to guide you in getting started on your Twitter career (Chris Brogan&#8217;s <a href="http://www.chrisbrogan.com/a-brief-and-informal-twitter-etiquette-guide/">Twitter Etiquette Guide</a> is a particularly good starter). Many of these guides help you by drawing the connection between real-life etiquette (e.g. cocktail party behaviour; introduce yourself, listen before speaking, etc.) and your Twitter life. But I&#8217;m actually experiencing the reverse-there a few key things that Twitter has taught me about relationships and how to cultivate them that I didn&#8217;t know before. In other words, Twitter has taught me lessons about life. I&#8217;m going to use examples from <a href="http://twitter.com/jodilastman">my very own Twitter account</a> to demonstrate what I&#8217;ve learned since Twitter came to town:</p>

<ul>
<li>  <strong>Make others feel good about their successes:</strong> I love hearing that someone&#8217;s enjoyed a blog post I&#8217;ve written or a link I&#8217;ve shared. And because I know that, I&#8217;m always delighted to be supportive of others. On Twitter you do it by ReTweeting (RTing),  replying to a post or DMing someone to say &#8220;good job.&#8221; In real life you do it by thanking people, complimenting them in front of others, or taking a quiet moment to tell them you&#8217;ve noticed something they&#8217;ve done well.</li>
<li>  *<em>Be Generous: *</em>On occasion I throw a question up on Twitter like &#8220;What&#8217;s the story with the new Canada post mailboxes?&#8221; I&#8217;ve also used Twitter to put out a call for help like when I was searching for <a href="http://hypenotic.com/blog/1865/fiesta-farms-video-shoot-1-meeting-nooria">Grannies</a> for the <a href="http://www.fiestafarms.ca">Fiesta Farms</a> website. People extend their generosity by answering the call. And I in turn do the same. This is the key to community building. And, it&#8217;s just good karma. So now when someone randomly asks me if I can help them tear-down at an event I&#8217;ve enjoyed being at, I lend a hand.</li>
<li>  *<em>Be Open: *</em>Meeting new people is fun. Following friends of friends of friends can lead to&#8230;new friends. You never know what you might discover by following someone new. I follow <a href="http://www.chefgui.com/">Gui Alinat </a>(@chefgui) on Twitter. Gui is a French born chef who lives in Tampa, Florida. Don&#8217;t ask me how I started following him. I couldn&#8217;t tell you. I do know that the other night we were Tweeting about what we were eating when the rest of the world was watching the Superbowl and eating Chilli. I was eating Moules Frite and he was having <em>leftover</em> Veal Cheeks (who has veal cheeks hanging around in their fridge?) and we were fast friends. I apply this to other events I go to. Someone may not look like your <em>type</em>, but I&#8217;ve met many great people by striking up a conversation and seeing where it goes.</li>
<li>  *<em>Be bold: *</em>At an fundraising event the other night, I was annoyed that people were speaking over the charitable representative who was there to talk about the devastation in Haiti. I started typing a Tweet that was milder than I really felt about the situation. Than I thought screw it, I&#8217;m going to say it the way I want to. I wrote &#8220;When at a fundraiser you should be quiet when someone from the charity gets up to speak.&#8221; Others agreed, and it was re-tweeted several times. Of course there are times, in the real world, when it makes sense to soft-pedal issues. But more often than not, people like you best when you take a clear stance on an issue.</li>
</ul>

<p>Twitter has enriched my life. It <em>has</em>. It has introduced me to new people and a much more social way of being in the world. Unlike Facebook, where it&#8217;s all about chatting with &#8216;friends,&#8217; building relationships with virtual strangers is tremendously educational and humbling. I&#8217;m learning that there&#8217;s still alot more to learn&#8211;both online and off.</p>

<p>What has social media like Twitter, Facebook, etc. taught you about life?</p>
