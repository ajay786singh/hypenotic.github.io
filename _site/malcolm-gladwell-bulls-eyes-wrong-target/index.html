        <h1>Malcolm Gladwell bulls-eyes wrong target</h1>
        <p class="meta"><span class="sub-meta">By</span>  <span class="sub-meta">in</span> category</p>
        <p>Anyone who enjoys complex ideas articulated compellingly, entertainingly and with style will enjoy Malcolm Gladwell&#8217;s writings.</p>

<p>His recent article in the New Yorker, called <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/10/04/101004fa_fact_gladwell" title="Small Change">&#8220;Small Change&#8221;</a> doesn&#8217;t disappoint on the usual counts, but it adds a new feature I hadn&#8217;t come across yet in his writing. It makes the wrong case.I&#8217;m a fan. If there&#8217;s room for disappointment in an indictment from someone I enjoy reading, it&#8217;s that it seems like the effort is banal and contrived. Forgive me for living in a bubble, but I thought we were done with questions like &#8220;why do I want to know what other people are eating for lunch&#8221;? Malcolm Gladwell may the most insightful and articulate pundit to not &#8220;get it&#8221;.</p>

<p>The case his prose brings to life focusses on Social Networking&#8217;s failure as a replacement for revolutionary acts that result in social change. And maybe I missed a memo somewhere, but take it from someone whose career is about influencing people through media; you don&#8217;t need a five page essay to make the point that it doesn&#8217;t. Anyone who thinks otherwise has moved from kool-aid into heavier stuff.</p>

<p>As someone who never considered a &#8220;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/" title="Meetup.org">Meetup</a>&#8221; a replacement for standing in front of a tank, I think it would be a great tool to get supporters and documenters to the event. You want a fast &#8220;sit-in&#8221;, organize a &#8220;tweet-up&#8221;.</p>

<p>If you want to plan in the dark, do it. But if you want to build relationships with people from all walks of life, varying demographics, undivided by space and time, solely connected through common interest, try Social Networking. It&#8217;s the right tool for the job.</p>

<p>1oo people wished me happy Birthday on Facebook the other day. A bunch more on Twitter. World-changing? No. But it was nice. Some of them were folks I rarely connect with and it was a good reminder to stop and smell the roses.</p>

<p>I support the fledgling efforts of the thousands of people who follow my @SlowFoodTO account on Twitter. Maybe they&#8217;ll change the world one day. Many of them are undeniably working at it daily.</p>

<p>Grist wrote an article the other day about <a href="http://www.grist.org/article/2010-10-12-what-monsantos-fall-from-grace-reveals-abo-the-gmo-seed-industry/">Monsanto&#8217;s fall from king to doormat on Wallstreet</a>. Among the reasons they cited were farmers realizing their yields were not as advertised. I bet they connected and discussed their issues online.</p>

<p>There are a lot of things you simply shouldn&#8217;t spend time on Social Networking for, like hanging pictures at your house. But we&#8217;re constantly discovering new connection opportunities, new awareness opportunities as this space rapidly evolves and we react to it.</p>

<p>While I have officially ceased to be amazed by the number of <a href="http://hypenotic.com/social-media-category/2818/why-do-smart-people-fear-social-media">intelligent people who don&#8217;t use it and claim that fact as indication that Social Networking is not useful</a>, I haven&#8217;t tired of teaching them about. These platforms are doing a lot to be more accessible to beginners and if you meet them halfway by scaling their short learning curves, you may find uses you weren&#8217;t able to see before the climb.</p>

<p>Back to the article, Let me leave you with three questions:</p>

<ol>
<li> Why the narrow focus? Social Networking is a medium like a telephone, not an act like Social Change.</li>
<li> Why throw the baby out with the bath water? Just because it doesn&#8217;t do what you want it to doesn&#8217;t make it useless.</li>
<li> Anyone else see Social Networking as the right tool for certain jobs? We&#8217;ve had loads of successes–maybe our standards are a bit lower?</li>
</ol>
