        Bonding with the West End Food Co-op
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">13 Jul 2012</span>

    <p>This week we&#8217;re in the West End Food Co-op&#8217;s Newsletter as &#8220;featured bondholders.&#8221; The West End Food Co-op is right down the road from our offices and we&#8217;ve had the pleasure of watching this transformational project unfold over many months, and years.</p>

<p>Have you bought <a href="https://westendfood.coop/contribute">your WEFC bonds yet? </a> Get on it. And, sign up for the <a href="http://westendfood.coop/civicrm/profile/create?reset=1&amp;gid=10">WEFC Newsletter for the latest </a>events and happenings, especially leading up to opening day. Here&#8217;s the profile they put together&#8211;and as a special bonus feature you get to see the whole Hypenotic team all in one group photo.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>&#8220;WEFC is an enterprise that blends good food with a commitment to food security and public health.  That means recognizing that good food is essential &#8211; for everyone.&#8221;</em></p>

<p><a href="http://westendfood.coop/content/bondholder-profile-hypenotic"><img src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/HypenoticTeam_0.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="372" /></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just around the corner from WEFC&#8217;s Food Hub, you can step right into the office of Hypenotic &#8211; a marketing and design company with integrity and meaningful communications being at the core of their values&#8230;and did we mention that they&#8217;re foodies too?</p>

<p>&#8220;We work with clients who are actively building the next economy, whether they’re entrepreneurs, non-profits or intra-preneurs,&#8221; explains Principal Strategist Barry Martin.  &#8220;Our roster of clients includes the likes of Fiesta Farms, The Gladstone Hotel, MaRS, Sustain Ontario and Canadian Immigrant. We are also a values based business, certified as a founding Canadian B Corp and working to spread the movement in Toronto and beyond.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hypenotic realizes that this area of Parkdale is very much in need of the kind of fresh, healthy foods that West End Food Co-op&#8217;s Food Hub will bring. &#8220;Community groups have been pouring their hearts and souls into this community for decades,&#8221; Hypenotic&#8217;s General Manager Jodi Lastman states.  &#8220;In speaking with community groups and municipal leaders, we’ve heard how a food co-op has long been part of Parkdale&#8217;s collective dream for itself. The realization of this dream means so much to so many community groups up and down Queen Street and tucked into nooks in every corridor of this area.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Why did you choose to become a bondholder, and invest in WEFC?</strong></p>

<p>The short answer? We think WEFC is a model of the kind of organization we need for a more sustainable, generative economy. We’re happy to support in many ways, but our bonds are an investment in the community we live and work in and a reminder that profit is a means, not an end in itself.</p>

<p><strong>What are you most excited about regarding WEFC?</strong></p>

<p>We&#8217;re already involved with WEFC through the community cannery and the Sorauren market. Now we&#8217;re excited about seeing the food hub open its doors. It&#8217;ll be a real treat to pick up lunch for the office or for a meeting, or pick up some staples for dinner time and know we&#8217;re supporting a venture that resonates with us on a deeper level.</p>

<p><strong>Why should others invest with WEFC?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>  WEFC is a living symbol of a business that serves its owners and community first.</li>
<li>  WEFC is an enterprise that blends good food with a commitment to food security and public health. That means recognizing that good food is essential–for everyone.</li>
<li>  Supporting WEFC is vote for stewards who bring a conscious, inclusive and long term perspective to development in Parkdale.</li>
</ul>

<p>We challenge all of the businesses up and down Queen Street to invest in a place that will be a critical hub in our community.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>About the Food Hub being on the verge of opening, Barry comments: &#8220;It&#8217;s a sign that Parkdale development can continue moving in the right direction–and we’re not talking about condos here.  Also, selfishly, we&#8217;re just really looking forward to grabbing some awesome lunches right around the corner and knowing our money is part of something that serves local producers, our neighbours and our values.&#8221;</p>

<p>West End Food Co-op is proud to have such strong support from the team at Hypenotic.</p>
