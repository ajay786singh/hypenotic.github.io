<p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: large;"><span style="font-size: 18px;"><em></em></span></span><span style="color: #444444; font-style: normal; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px;">The majority of people, myself included, are content hungry and research lazy. We don&#8217;t want to take the time to read. At the same time we want to know everything  we could imagine at the speed of light. News worthy and useful content has become increasingly accessible; next on the agenda is making content faster and easier to understand. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #444444; font-style: normal; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px;">So what is the anecdote  to make interesting content quickly digestible? Infographics. <a rel="attachment wp-att-4964" href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/4908/satisfy-your-information-urges-with-the-infographic/attachment/royal-wedding-infographic3-thumb-600x1874-49404-5"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4964" title="royal-wedding-infographic3-thumb-600x1874-49404" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/royal-wedding-infographic3-thumb-600x1874-494044-327x1024.jpg" alt="" width="231" height="721" /></a> They&#8217;re popping up everywhere and on every conceivable topic. This infographic on the right was created to map the social media buzz around the Royal wedding.</span></p>

<p>The illustration is easy to follow and allows the viewer to quickly absorb the highnotes:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Most people chose to use twitter to write about the wedding</li>
<li>  The Queen was the celebrity that was most written about</li>
<li>  Social media was consistently sued throughout the entire day</li>
<li>  The US contributed to more than half of the overall social media buzz on the topic</li>
</ul>

<p>If I had opened Linkedin to find a long article about social media and the Royal Wedding I would have ignored it. But instead, I got a little info-snack that satisfied my appetite for information about the royal wedding.</p>

<p>This leads me to an important question:</p>

<p>Are we becoming  savvy in our efforts to intake information quickly, or are we simply becoming intellectually lazy?</p>

<p>Erin McPhee, Illustration Student at Sheridan College, and Hypenotic&#8217;s newest Graphic Design Intern, says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I believe that we exist in a very visceral media environment-  information is often delivered to us in the form of images (we&#8217;re seeing more and more infographics in place of, or in conjunction with print/editorial information.) Undeniably, we now have an expectation for instant satisfaction- if information is not presented to us in a very immediate way, we loose interest. In this respect, we&#8217;re more impatient. However as long as the work presented by  illustrators, artists and designers respects and appeals to the intelligence of the reader, I would say that it is not an inherently bad thing.&#8221;</p>
