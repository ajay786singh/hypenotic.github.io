  <p><a href="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/photo-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6543" title="Me at the Office" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/photo-2-580x432.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="432" /></a></p>

<p>Before packing up my things and waving bon voyage to Hypenotic, I was asked to write a post about &#8216;What I Learned at Hypenotic.&#8217; I couldn&#8217;t help but smirk at the notion since I could fill pages with the knowledge I&#8217;ve gained.</p>

<p>However- ironically- one of these tid-bits of knowledge I&#8217;ve gained is that blog posts should be short and sweet, so here goes:</p>

<p>If there&#8217;s one thing I learnt during my welcome stay here, it&#8217;s that it pays to invest in a good quality, ergonomic chair and wrist rest. I&#8217;ve been spoiled here, and the thought of returning to my cold, hard, rickety wooden chair makes me shudder.</p>

<p>I kid! I kid! Kinda- this insight would fall under the category of menial but notable discoveries I&#8217;ve made, along with; yoga on your lunch hour- with your boss- increases productivity and focus along with building good rapport, grinding the coffee beans too much leads to a murky mug, two for one falafels fall on Tuesdays and cardboard is a suitable solution to overpowering A/C.</p>

<p>Joking aside, I gained more than just a few pals, knowledge of where to get the tastiest coffee from, and feelings of accomplishment- both due to gaining my 420 hours necessary for graduation, as well as for all of the important projects and work that they’ve graciously trusted me with.</p>

<p>As in, real work.<br>
For clients.<br>
Start to finish.</p>

<p>That’s a heck of a lot more than the coffee-runs I unknowingly expected when I heard the word “intern” back a few months ago.</p>

<p>My most significant discoveries are obviously more weighty, learning a ton about good business, design, organization, prioritizing and compromise.</p>

<p>In a world unlike school- where your aesthetic direction is all up to you- finding that balance between what you&#8217;d like to see visually and what the client would like, was- admittedly- a tough pickle to be caught in at first.</p>

<p>Compromise, compromise, compromise, I kept hearing in my head. Not too much that when you finish and see the product, you blurt &#8220;who in the heck made this?&#8221;, but practice your bendability and never think of your work as too precious.</p>

<p>Sometimes when you listen to suggestion- that isn’t your inside voice&#8217;s-, you surprise yourself by producing better work- and other times, not so much!</p>

<p>It’s all about going with the flow, and knowing that- especially as a creative- rarely will you ever follow a straight, predictable path to reach that satisfying finish line. It makes it more fun, right?&#8230; Or perhaps the right world is interesting- anything but dull and lackluster.</p>

<p>As I leave this position to recede back into the dark hole that is school’s bubble of safeness- kidding, again- mostly…-, I’ll take with me the knowledge and understanding that the &#8220;real-world&#8221; isn&#8217;t nearly as intimidating or scary as I thought. Bottom line.</p>

<p>I know every business and every body works differently, eats differently, talks differently, etc., but being an intern here at Hypenotic has given me the confidence and desire to go kick some @ss, and I thank you all for that- that means you Barry, Jodi, Rick, Lionel, Rebecca and Sonja, Erin- and Sonya!</p>

<p>What do I want to do when I graduate? Everything and anything that falls into my lap that I&#8217;ll enjoy doing.<br>
My plan is to have no plans, and take every day in stride.</p>

<p>So with that, I&#8217;ve got to go catch the bus for my long commute home for the last time- for now&#8230;</p>
