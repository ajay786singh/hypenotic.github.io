  <p><a rel="attachment wp-att-2342" href="http://hypenotic.com/social-media-category/2340/turn-that-party-inside-out/attachment/screen-shot-2010-05-06-at-10-12-50-am"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2342" title="Screen shot 2010-05-06 at 10.12.50 AM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Screen-shot-2010-05-06-at-10.12.50-AM.png" alt="" width="208" height="208" /></a>The typical kid&#8217;s birthday party. You invite the kids, play the usual games, open presents and then crack out the video camera in time for the cake and the blowing out of candles.</p>

<p>What if you thought about the party from the perspective of posterity? The video might be more important than an afterthought. What if you gave the historical record of the party equal priority to the party itself? Would you make a nicer cake? Smile more?</p>

<p>Before you cringe with thoughts of the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120382/">Truman Show </a>consider this&#8211;you might interview your child a few moments before the guests arrive to ask your daughter &#8220;How does it feel to be 3?&#8221; or &#8220;Why did you choose to wear that dress?&#8221; And after the party you might ask her to reflect on how it all went. In between you&#8217;d capture all the moments (hopefully) worth remembering.</p>

<p>Now think about social media content in a much more grown-up context. There are a multitude of ways social media can be integrated into events once they&#8217;ve been planned. Chris Brogan has an <a href="http://www.chrisbrogan.com/how-events-can-use-social-media/">outstanding article</a> on how to promote and extend the value of your events using social media. And, there are other helpful articles outlining how <a href="http://www.eventcoup.com/10-ways-social-media-will-transform-events-in">social media is already transforming events.</a></p>

<p>But my focus is slightly different. I&#8217;d like you to consider how the corporate parties, events, gatherings, talks, conferences  you participate in would look different if you were thinking about them from the perspective of web content&#8211;right from the get-go.</p>

<ul>
<li>  Would you spend a bit more to get the better speaker knowing it could live on your site?</li>
<li>  Would you fly the attendees in the night before so you could have a chance to talk to them about their expectations for the event, why they came as marketing for your event in the future?</li>
<li>  Would you host an after-party to gather reflections on the event?</li>
<li>  Would you select a different venue?</li>
<li>  Would you add a unique twist to the party that could make for an interesting conversation piece to be captured during the course of the day?</li>
</ul>

<p>Often, clients come to us with a list of events and initiatives in hand, and we work with them to develop a social media matrix where we collaborate to come up with useful, relevant content that could emerge from an event or activity.</p>

<p>Ideally, the social media content would be considered beforehand and inform decisions every step of the way. After all the &#8220;audience&#8221; for your event extends far beyond the people who will actually be able to attend. Your virtual attendees may in fact be far greater than the folks who can be there in person. Nothing wrong with that. In fact, you may chose to host a small gathering with the purpose of generating content&#8211;small gatherings are perfect for chatting with folks with minimal noise disruption. Here are some reflections on how to think about planning your events for your &#8216;real&#8217; and &#8216;virtual&#8217; audiences:</p>

<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-2353" href="http://hypenotic.com/social-media-category/2340/turn-that-party-inside-out/attachment/screen-shot-2010-05-06-at-10-43-27-am"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2353" title="Screen shot 2010-05-06 at 10.43.27 AM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Screen-shot-2010-05-06-at-10.43.27-AM.png" alt="" width="132" height="176" /></a></p>

<ul>
<li>  Get a <a href="http://www.theflip.com/en-ca/">Flip Camera</a>. It costs $200, it fits in your pocket and it&#8217;s typically all you need. Well, that and a <a href="http://store.theflip.com/en-ca/products/Product.aspx?SKU=AAT1B">small tripod</a> you can use to set up when you want more intimate one-on-one conversations.</li>
<li>  Consider your guest list. Are there people you&#8217;d like to be able to &#8216;show&#8217; attending your event? Be sure to invite them along. But also know they won&#8217;t come unless there&#8217;s something in it for them (fun, food, networking, profile, etc.)</li>
<li>  Consider pre and post events. Create as many opportunities to talk with people as possible in a range of venues. Let&#8217;s face it, the &#8220;networking lunch&#8221; sessions are busy and crowded. Not ideal for content creation.</li>
<li>  Get a room. You might want to rent a room at the venue especially to interview folks during the event. Supply it with snacks, beverages, etc and promise people, &#8220;it&#8217;ll only take 5 mins,&#8221; and then stand by it. Don&#8217;t take up too much of people&#8217;s time.</li>
<li>  Create a topic, a visual focus&#8212;Something for people to reflect on. It&#8217;s like this, if I ask my daughter &#8220;how was school today,&#8221; I get a blank stare. If I ask her, &#8220;What craft did you do today&#8221; I&#8217;ll actually get an answer. Give people specific items to focus on and then ask them specific questions. Create a giant board where people can write down their thoughts on a specific question and capture it in real time video. We made a <a href="http://www.fiestafarms.ca">Fiesta Farms</a> party into a potluck and we&#8217;re excited to have the chance to talk to everyone about the dish they decided to bring.</li>
</ul>
