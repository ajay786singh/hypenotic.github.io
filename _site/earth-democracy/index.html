  <p>Vandana Shiva is speaking at Hart House in Toronto on October 22nd. If you don&#8217;t know her, she&#8217;s the current VP of Slow Food International, a powerhouse working on important issues that ultimately affect us all. I&#8217;ve reposted the entire invite page from Hart House here:</p>

<h3>Hart House presents Vandana Shiva</h3>

<p><strong>Register by October 9 to win tickets</strong>, <a href="http://www.harthouse.utoronto.ca/beta/html/events/shiva.php#register">click here</a>.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t miss the keynote event of Hart House&#8217;s <a href="http://www.harthouse.ca/foodweek">World Food Week</a>: internationally acclaimed author, ecologist, physicist and activist Vandana Shiva will engage audiences in an Earth Democracy discussion &#8211; her philosophy based on inclusion, nonviolence, reclaiming the commons and freely sharing the earth’s resources. At the core of this philosophy is the idea of Food democracy.&lt;!--more--&gt;</p>

<p>Shiva is the vice- president of the global organization Slow Food International and the author of such books as Soil Not Oil, Earth Democracy and Stolen Harvest: The Hijacking of the Global Food Supply and one of the leaders of the International Forum on Globalization. She has made numerous appearances in both film &amp; television including &#8220;<strong>One Water</strong>&#8220;, &#8220;<strong>Flow: For Love of Water</strong>&#8221; and is featured on the PBS NOW documentary entitled &#8220;<strong>On Thin Ice</strong>&#8220;.</p>

<p><strong>Tickets: $15 students, $25 non-students</strong></p>

<h4>About the Earth Democracy Evening with Vandana Shiva</h4>

<p>The web of life is a food web. Today, this web is severely threatened by new technology to manipulate seed and terminate its fertility, by the obsession with monocultures, by the excessive use of oil and petrochemical based inputs, by the diversion of food to make biofuel to run automobiles. In effect we are eating oil and our food is being transformed into oil.</p>

<p>Across the world, food riots are taking place. In Mexico there have been tortilla riots. In Italy, pasta protests. In India, people have attacked ration shops in West Bengal. In Mauritania and Mozambique, in Burkina Faso and Senegal, people have descended on streets to fight for food. 33 countries face social unrest due to rising food prices.</p>

<p>Food democracy has become vital to defend people’s food rights. And food democracy is a vital pillar of Earth Democracy. Either we will produce good food for all, working with gaia and her laws, or we will have no food at all. Good food for all is not just possible, it has become a necessity.</p>

<h4>About Vandana Shiva</h4>

<p>For physicist, environmental activist, feminist, ecologist and author of a dozen books and over 300 articles Vandana Shiva, “<strong>being change</strong>” means a life of campaigning for the right of people and our planet to live and thrive, free of the interference of corporate and governmental greed.</p>

<p>She does her work by travelling almost constantly to meet with a huge range of people: grassroots organizations of women and farmers, research scientists, governments and corporations. She advises international bodies such as the United Nations, she works on an organic farm in India with other women, and she challenges the richest and most powerful multinational corporations in the world, corporations like Monsanto and Wal-Mart.</p>

<p>Shiva grew up in the foothills of the Himalayas, and was educated in India and Canada, where she earned a master’s degree in the philosophy of science at Guelph University and a PhD in particle physics at the University of Western Ontario. Returning home from Canada, she was horrified to find ancient forests being ripped out of existence by westerners who wanted to grow apples where the forests had been. She joined the Chipko Movement, grassroots women who were campaigning to save trees.</p>

<p>Since then, Shiva’s activities have multiplied almost beyond belief. In order to be independent of influence from governments and wealthy corporations, she founded the Research Foundation for Science, Technology and Ecology, which she defines as “a participatory, public interest research organization.” While it now has offices in New Delhi, at first the foundation met in her mother’s cowshed. “When I found global corporations wanted to patent seeds, crops or life forms, I started Navdanya to protect biodiversity, defend farmers’ rights and promote organic farming.” Part of this work now involves conserving and storing heritage seeds.</p>
