        <h1>My New-ish Favourite App: Path</h1>
        <p class="meta"><span class="sub-meta">By</span>  <span class="sub-meta">in</span> category</p>
        <h3><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9738" style="border: none!important;" title="path_1" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/path_1.png" alt="" width="580" height="300" /></h3>

<h3><strong>Platform:</strong></h3>

<p>iOS, Android (I use it on my iPhone 4)</p>

<h3><strong>What it&#8217;s for:</strong></h3>

<p><a href="https://path.com">Path</a> is a &#8220;closed&#8221; social network, to stay connected with your close friends &amp; family. It acts as a journal of your life, where you can post, where you are, what you&#8217;re doing, who you&#8217;re with, and include a photo or video. It also sports a section for sharing what music you&#8217;re listening to, what movie you&#8217;re watching, or what book you&#8217;re reading. <img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-9739" title="path_2" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/path_2.png" alt="" width="135" height="132" />For the athletes out there, you can also sync it with your Nike Fuelband to keep track of your running/jogging/walking milage. Your &#8220;path&#8221; is only accessible to those whom you&#8217;ve accepted as a friend. Unlike Twitter, where you&#8217;re encouraged to openly share with everyone, and Facebook where you feel obliged to be friends with your entire school&#8217;s student body, Path has a slightly more personal touch.</p>

<p>Besides posting things, you also have the ability to include a &#8220;reaction&#8221; of sorts, on to other people&#8217;s posts. You can include a little &#8220;emotion&#8221;, regarding how you feel about a specific post, as well as a regular comment. The last neat feature is a button to post when you&#8217;re going to sleep and when you&#8217;ve just woken up. At first, the notion of sharing this seems a little creepy, but I&#8217;ve found it to be a nice feature to keep track of my sleeping patterns. Upon &#8220;waking up&#8221; in Path, it gives you the current weather conditions and temperature, as well as a log of how many hours you slept.</p>

<h3><strong>Why I like it:</strong></h3>

<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-9740" title="path_3" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/path_3.png" alt="" width="135" height="132" />Although I use and enjoy both Twitter, and Facebook, Path offers a slightly more personal and intimate experience. With my entire immediate family on it, I&#8217;ve enjoyed things like seeing my brother post all sorts of checkins and photos on a vacation he took with his fiancé in Nova Scotia, or my Mom frowing at me when I eat fast food, or my Dad&#8217;s updates on his latest golf game.</p>

<p>It also sports a very clean, and easy to use interface, with lots of neat interactions. Admittedly, I occasionally spend too much time opening and closing the main menu, just to watch the animation toggle. Everything is pretty straightforward to use, and as a nice touch you can additionally push your posts to other social networks like Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr and Foursquare.</p>

<h3><strong>What could be better:</strong></h3>

<p>First of all, Path only exists on mobile devices. The interface is sleek on the phones, but has a lot of potential for a different, web based layouts. When you share Path posts on other social networks, you get a look at that one post, but there&#8217;s no way to see all of you and your friend&#8217;s posts online in your browser. Although I suspect that it is partially my phones fault (the iPhone 4 is now almost two generations old, and I probably have too much stuff on it), but when I active the built-in camera in Path, it always takes a little longer than I like for it to fire up. Often, you&#8217;ll want a really quick snap of something to share, and I&#8217;ve missed a couple owing to the slowness of it. I&#8217;m interested to see how it is on an iPhone 4S, or on the soon to be released iPhone 5.</p>

<h3><strong>Who else might benefit from it:</strong></h3>

<p>Anyone who wants to share moments with only the people they want will love this app. On Path, it&#8217;s not how many people you are friends with, but the quality of people, and the moments you share with them. It&#8217;s especially great for travellers &amp; vacationers who want to instantly share their trip&#8217;s ongoings with friends and family. However you use it, Path is a great app to stay connected with those who matter to you.</p>

<h3>Where do I get it?:</h3>

<p><a href="https://path.com">Path</a> is freely available to download and use from the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/path/id403639508?mt=8">Apple App Store</a> and the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.path">Google Play Store</a>.</p>
