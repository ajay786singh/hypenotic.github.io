<p>It&#8217;s hard for me to believe, but four months have flown by and I am already down to my last day <em>chez</em> Hypenotic.<br>
In about a week&#8217;s time, I will be plunging back headlong into the world of architecture; not without some new trinkets to bring along with me!</p>

<p>This has definitely been my favourite internship in all my 5 years as a Waterloo student. I haven&#8217;t done much travelling (that is, beyond the reaches of the TTC and the scenic Don Valley Parkway), I didn&#8217;t try new exotic foods (Bavarian butter pretzels are still my favourite), but this semester was memorable because I actually learned a lot in the internship itself.</p>

<p>This internship helped me break out of the jaded feeling that I came in with. I thought I had a pretty good sense of graphic design and typography before, but boy did I have much to learn! I am now convinced that everyone in the design field needs a typography lesson (or two..?). Knowing how to use type to its full potential really makes a subtle, yet substantial difference. During these few months I felt artsier as a person, more eager to try new things. I picked up painting again, and knitting, and drawing. I took the time to get better at guitar. I felt more inspired, because my 9-to-5 consisted of dwelling on inspiration, on inspiring people in this city. I&#8217;m a quiet person, and I know I don&#8217;t usually say much at the office, but I have been listening in and observing and picking up on things here and there, be it web developing jargon or politics. And of course, hanging out at Hypenotic proved to me that there are many, many things that design can do for good (without just saying so).</p>

<p>Thanks, Hypenotic, for making me more excited about design than I ever have been.</p>

<p>Dorothy, signing out.</p>
