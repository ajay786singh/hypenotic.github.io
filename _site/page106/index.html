</p>

<p>I like lots of things about Halloween. I the dressing up part, the way kids parade throughout the neighbourhood, being visited by pint-sized draculas and fairies.  I really do enjoy it. That&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t do any of the very well intended alternatives to Halloween like <a href="http://www.uusc.org/rtot/reverse-trick-or-treating">reverse trick or treating </a> or staying home and throwing a party and giving the kids as much cake as they can consume.</p>

<p>But Halloween gives me grief because it presses so many pain points that are core to my values system. Please, let me unload:</p>

<ul>
<li>  I don&#8217;t like my kids eating tons of candy and begging for it constantly. That food is unhealthy and I don&#8217;t want it in the house.</li>
<li>  I don&#8217;t like supporting big, bad companies like <a href="http://www.nestle.ca/en/index">Nestlé</a> and <a href="http://www.canadaonly.ca/brands/Cadbury.html">Cadbury</a> who make a living off of making bad food (even if they sometimes run <a href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9305/why-cadburys-bicycle-factory-is-a-few-spokes-shy-of-a-wheel">CSR programs to &#8220;give back&#8221;</a>)</li>
<li>  I am fundamentally opposed to the horrible practices that basically mean that some far-away children suffer to harvest cacao so that our kids can have fun, eat crap and get fat (Have you read <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/valentines/qa-off.html">Carole Off&#8217;s Bitter Chocolate?</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Ok, so granted I was not in a good frame-of-mind when I ran into Loblaws (not my usual store but conveniently located for the rush to pick up the kids). I went to find some better Halloween options. You know where this is going&#8230;.</p>

<p>Well, call me naive, but I figured with all of their hoopla about local and sustainable (aside from <a href="http://www.thestar.com/living/article/1127787--loblaw-chief-says-farmers-markets-pose-health-risk">Galen&#8217;s gaff about Farmer&#8217;s Markets</a>) over at Loblaws there had to be <em>something</em> decent to pick off the shelves.</p>

<p>On the day I visited, the Loblaws&#8217; staff were outfitted in t-shirts about saving the ocean (I figure it&#8217;s part of their  <a href="http://www.oceansfortomorrow.ca/en/leading-change/">&#8220;Oceans for Tomorrow&#8221;</a> campaign to have only sustainable seafood in the store by 2013). That made it even more ironic when I discovered nothing but the usual Halloween fare on the store shelves. None of the staff could help me and in fact seemed to think the question about &#8220;alternative halloween options&#8221; made me such a fringe freako that they were wondering why they didn&#8217;t smell the Patchouli when I walked through the door.</p>

<p>So now, in addition to <em>all</em> of the bad feelings I have swarming my head about Halloween I also have to deal with my distaste for CSR hypocrisy where a company can be working to save the oceans while still making money primarily on the sale of horrible processed food.</p>

<p>Just in case you thought it was a matter of supply, there are a few options like <a href="http://www.yummyearth.com/index.html">organic lollypops</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Annies-Homegrown-Halloween-Graham-9-7-Ounce/dp/B008POG4X0">bunny crackers</a>, etc. In fact there&#8217;s a whole list at <a href="http://greenhalloween.org/content.php?page=treats">Green Halloween</a>, But you&#8217;ve got to be on the  ball enough to order ahead of time or track that stuff down. And while I&#8217;m totally game to live by my values, I&#8217;m still a mom with little time on her hands, looking for something I can get quickly and close to home.</p>

<p>So, my solution for the past three years has been buying <a href="http://www.lasiembra.com/camino/en/chocolate-treats">Cocoa Camino Chocolate Treats</a> and giving one to each child. My kids think I&#8217;m a horrible person for giving such a tiny morsel out on Halloween, but those chocolates are expensive. I&#8217;m not complaining. I realize I&#8217;m paying the &#8220;full cost&#8221; of producing chocolate. But that means each kid gets one.</p>

<p>It turns out that giving away just one is a good thing, since I wish my kids came home with a few, well curated treats rather than a bag overflowing with crap.</p>

<p>But, of course I remain conflicted. Even though I will post these <a href="http://www.equalexchange.coop/fairtradehalloween">fair trade Halloween posters </a>to help make sense of the tiny chocolate morsel kids will get in their bag, it is unlikely that it will make much of an impact in and amongst the mountains of Kit Kat and Coffee Crisps that will be dumped on the floor and sorted out late Halloween night. I&#8217;m also inserting a small card inside the bag. It will read:</p>

<blockquote>
<div>
  Happy Halloween!
</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>
  You might notice we put a (tiny) fair trade chocolate in your child&#8217;s bag. There&#8217;s a reason for this and you can find out more about the reason here  <a href="http://foodispower.org/slavery_chocolate.php" target="_blank">http://foodispower.org/<wbr>slavery_chocolate.php</wbr></a>

  We hope next year you consider joining us in making food fair, for everyone.

<p>I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll be alot of eye rolling in the neighbourhood Halloween night. Oh well. This is one issue I&#8217;m going to take a small stand on. While I generally avoid frequently used quotes, I am reminded of this one attributed to the Dali Lama: &#8220;If you think you are too small to make a difference, try sleeping with a mosquito.&#8221; Hey, I think I just figured out my Halloween costume (no, not the Dali Lama, a mosquito silly.)</p>
