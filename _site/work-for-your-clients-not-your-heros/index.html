  <h1 class="post-title">Work for your clients, not your heroes.</h1>
  <span class="post-date">11 Jul 2012</span>
  <span class="post-author"></span>
  <p>Sometimes, it can be just as important to know who your audience ISN&#8217;T, as knowing who it is.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had two conversations with people this week that reminded me how much energy people waste worrying about the wrong audience.</p>

<p>One alluded to the need to avoid any visual reference to their field (photography) because it would be too challenging to use it in a way that their peers wouldn&#8217;t find cheesy. I get that sentiment–Hypenotic wouldn&#8217;t use computers in our identity materials either. The notable part is that he was concerned about looking amateurish to his peers. I explained that photographers don&#8217;t hire him. They don&#8217;t particularly recommend him. And if they did, it would be because of his studio&#8217;s unique offering, remarkable facility and his reputation, not because of some art on their web page.</p>

<p>The other conversation was with a painter building a site for her work. As usual, I tried to find the hook–why should anyone spend more than 2 seconds on her site? What traction could she offer that would help people stick around longer than they needed to understand that she was a painter and to glance at the aesthetic? How might a vistor identify with her, or remember her, or discuss her?</p>

<p>The convention in the art space is to draw from galleries–as white as possible so the work stands out. But a website isn&#8217;t a gallery. You can&#8217;t control the clutter on the reader&#8217;s desk or desktop, the resolution of their monitor, whether the sunlight is bouncing off their laptop or monitor, or if their kids are screaming at them while they&#8217;re trying to look at the work. etc. It seems to me that if you&#8217;d like your work to stick out, the least you might try is differentiating from every other artist&#8217;s website.</p>

<p>I understand where these sentiments come from. I have them too. I design and critique our work with a jury of my heroes standing over it. Which is of course silly. It&#8217;s great to be detail oriented and true to your vision, but if there&#8217;s one audience you really want to make an impression on, shouldn&#8217;t it be the people who might actually buy your product?</p>

<p>My clients aren&#8217;t Stephen Sagmeister, Milton Glaser, Saul Bass, Jeffrey Zeldman, Jason Santamaria or Seth Godin (who it happens, did indeed once give us a glowing review, but that&#8217;s another story). They&#8217;re people with expertise in completely different verticals than mine. They may or may not have years of experience assessing design deliverables.</p>

<p>Before you dismiss the argument by telling yourself you&#8217;re addressing both audiences, I&#8217;d suggest you spend a few minutes honestly considering what your clients have in common with your heroes. Word view? Experience? Training?</p>

<p>You could be wasting time and energy while overlooking opportunities to differentiate from your peers who haven&#8217;t read this post.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>
