  <p>Five years ago when we began working with <a href="http://www.fiestafarms.ca/">Fiesta Farms </a>Hypenotic created a strategic platform based on the core idea that Food Matters for Fiesta Farms&#8217; shoppers. This vision was already being manifested in the store, but our challenge was to make it live online. In short, we wanted to create a website and content that truly reflected all of the reasons Fiesta Farms&#8217; shoppers loved their shopping experience.</p>

<p>Early on Fiesta Farm&#8217;s success was rooted in its commitment to meeting the needs of local shoppers, many of whom were Italian and Portugese. Fiesta was surrounded by other stores that were too big to specialize, so Fiesta focused on giving its Italian and Portugese customers a taste of home.</p>

<p>While local and organic foods are now a big and ever-growing part of what makes Fiesta Farms unique, the store hasn&#8217;t forgotten its roots. Fiesta still has a core focus on providing customers with specialty foods that other stores shove into a generic &#8220;International&#8221; aisle. Having a taste of home is about more than putting that special <a href="http://www.nestleusa.com/brands/baking/abuelita">Mexican hot chocolate</a> or an <a href="http://www.fiestafarms.ca/1388/food/the-machiavelli">obscure Italian soda</a> in your cart, it&#8217;s a way to connect with one&#8217;s past, history, culture and family.  In short, these specialty foods play a special role in demonstrating some of the key reasons food matters.</p>

<p>For the past four years we&#8217;ve used Mother&#8217;s and Father&#8217;s Day as an opportunity to celebrate families and their love of food in Fiesta Farms&#8217; <a href="http://www.apronstrings.fiestafarms.ca/">Apron Strings </a>initiative. The core of the initiative is a video series that focuses in on moms and dads making and sharing a traditional recipe with their family members.</p>

<p>This year&#8217;s series was a true pleasure to be part of. We met three great families who generously let us into their homes to document their deep connection to food as the stuff of life. We&#8217;re proud to share them with you here.</p>
