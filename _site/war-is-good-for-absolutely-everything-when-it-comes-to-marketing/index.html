        <h1>War is Good for Absolutely Everything (When it comes to Marketing)</h1>
        <p class="meta"><span class="sub-meta">By</span>  <span class="sub-meta">in</span> category</p>
        <p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1804" title="Screen shot 2010-01-28 at 11.07.31 AM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Screen-shot-2010-01-28-at-11.07.31-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2010-01-28 at 11.07.31 AM" width="292" height="96" />Sundance Film Festival opened with a screening of <a href="http://sundance.bside.com/2010/films/howl_sundance2010">Howl </a>based on renowned maverick poet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Ginsberg">Allen Ginsberg</a>&#8216;s famous poem. Selecting this film and it&#8217;s notably anti-conformist subject was a calculated move for the Festival which is taking the opportunity to position Sundance as the Anti-Hollywood, Anti-Blockbuster Festival.  As the Toronto Star reported,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The battle slogan was ordered by Redford himself: &#8220;Fight Against The Establishment of the Expected. This Is the Rebirth of the Battle for Brave New Ideas.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The economic downturn has left the indie-film industry fighting for it&#8217;s life. So, Sundance has stood up and declared it&#8217;s mission to create an Army of indie devotees. As Redford says &#8220;It might be a small army, but I hope it&#8217;s a big army.&#8221;</p>

<p>The army metaphor has become a big trend in communications. The new message is kick cancer&#8217;s, AIDS&#8217;, Autisms&#8217; ass. And it&#8217;s consistent with the &#8216;me&#8217; generation&#8217;s approach to getting things done. Anyone remember the much-maligned <a href="http://www.charmaineyoest.com/2006/11/army_marketing_army_strong_but.php">&#8220;Army of One&#8221; </a>Recruitment ads? While those ads focus on the war metaphor, they miss the value of galvanizing people together to create powerful social change. In other words, as one critic stated: &#8220;If you want to be an &#8216;Army of One&#8217; you probably want to join the Hell&#8217;s Angels, not the U.S. Army.&#8221; It&#8217;s not about individuality. It&#8217;s about bringing people *together *around a cause or issue that matters to them.</p>

<p>In the case of Sundance, who has in past years been accused of<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3649585/The-big-sell-out-at-Sundance.html"> selling out, </a>they have taken a firm stance and gotten bullish about their cause. And in so doing, they have positioned their Festival against the Hollywood machine. While the war, army metaphors are resoundingly male they have gathered their army around a simple, less balls-out idea: love. All of the films in this year&#8217;s Festival were chosen because at least one juror was madly, hopelessly in love with that film: Sundance director John Cooper, said</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;We all looked each other in the eyes and we said, `We are only going to show a film if someone among us loves that film.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Declaring war requires an organization to determine what it stands for. It&#8217;s not enough to battle against the big, simply because they are big. It&#8217;s not enough to be the Anti-something. You have to determine what <em>you</em> stand for before asking others to step up and support your cause.</p>

<p>How to effectively gather an army? Here are a few questions for consideration:</p>

<ul>
<li>  *<em>Pick your Target: *</em>Who are you against? The FDA? Big Food? The Fashion Industry? Cancer?</li>
<li>  *<em>Build your Army: *</em>Who are your constituents? What do they care about?</li>
<li>  *<em>Take Aim: *</em>What do these constituents hate most about that entity you&#8217;re targeting ? That they don&#8217;t care? They they are greedy? That they are inauthentic?</li>
<li>  <strong>Create Your Rallying Cry:</strong> What&#8217;s the one thing you stand for. The one thing that no one will forget as you&#8217;re marching through the trenches? For Sundance it&#8217;s about love. For <a href="http://www.methodhome.com/">Method </a>it&#8217;s about  transparency about ingredients in cleaning products.</li>
<li>  *<em>Decide when you&#8217;ll Declare Victory. *</em>When will you know you&#8217;ve won the battle? The war? Create measurable goals to help create success. Share those goals with your Army.</li>
<li>  *<em>Fire! *</em>Create the media to help gather your troops and march into battle. Help them see that there&#8217;s a critical mass around the issue you care about to maintain momentum. Continue creating ways for people to engage using all the weapons in your arsenal (Social media (you tube, fickr, twitter) Traditional media (posters, ads) Events, etc.</li>
<li>  <strong>Rinse &amp; Repeat</strong></li>
