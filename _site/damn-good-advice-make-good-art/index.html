<p>Hi Everyone! I&#8217;m Amanda, and I&#8217;m new here at Hypenotic. I thought it would be a great idea to introduce myself with a bit of <em>Damn Good Advice</em>. I don&#8217;t want to just give you simple advice like “Don’t cut your own bangs” or, “Careful, Robin. Both hands on the Bat-Rope.”  Instead, I&#8217;m going to tell you what I learned from one of the best creatives and mentors out there.</p>

<p>Neil Gaiman&#8217;s speech addressing the 2012 graduating class of the <a href="http://www.uarts.edu/">University of the Arts in Philadelphia</a> featured on <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/">Brain Pickings</a> really struck a chord with me. <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/">Neil Gaiman&#8217;s</a> a spectacular author who, as he likes to put it, &#8220;makes things up and writes them down.&#8221;</p>

<p>He’s written such novels as <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/works/Books/Coraline/">Coraline</a>, <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/works/Books/American+Gods/">American Gods</a> (my personal favorite), and <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/works/Books/Stardust/">Stardust.</a> He’s kind of a big deal.</p>

<p>Neil’s bit of <em>Damn Good Advice</em> for the graduates (and everyone, really) is simple: Make Good Art. And make it especially when things are rough.</p>

<p>He advises those who don’t feel that they are inherently creative to ignore that feeling and just do it! Or at the very least, enjoy it.</p>

<p>I believe that the very root of art is a form of expression, which can be anything really. Foodie? Make a good sandwich. Or at the very least, enjoy a good sandwich. You’ll be happier because of it (true fact: sandwiches make everything better). It really boils down to doing what you love, whatever that may be, especially when things aren’t exactly where you want them to be. So here&#8217;s what Neil Gaiman has to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Sometimes life is hard. Things go wrong — and in life, and in love, and in business, and in friendship, and in health, and in all the other ways in which life can go wrong. And when things get tough, this is what you should do: Make good art. I’m serious. Husband runs off with a politician? Make good art. Leg crushed and then eaten by a mutated boa constrictor? Make good art. IRS on your trail? Make good art. Cat exploded? Make good art. Someone on the internet thinks what you’re doing is stupid, or evil, or it’s all been done before? Make good art … Go and make interesting mistakes, make amazing mistakes, make glorious and fantastic mistakes. Break rules. Leave the world more interesting for your being here. Make. Good. Art.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There you have it, make good art, or at the very least find something you love to do and really enjoy it. Oh and seriously, don’t cut your own bangs.</p>
