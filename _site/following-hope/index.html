  <p><a rel="attachment wp-att-2184" href="http://hypenotic.com/social-media-category/2160/following-hope/attachment/screen-shot-2010-04-05-at-11-53-13-am"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2184" title="Screen shot 2010-04-05 at 11.53.13 AM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-05-at-11.53.13-AM.png" alt="" width="214" height="158" /></a>Over a year ago, I reconnected with an old friend Leanne (actually my ex-ex-ex-boyfriend&#8217;s sister) by discovering her <a href="http://blog.en.chatelaine.com/living-with-breast-cancer">blog </a>on Chatelaine&#8217;s website. The first post I stumbled on was called <a href="http://blog.en.chatelaine.com/living-with-breast-cancer/losing-it/">Losing It</a> and chronicled Leanne&#8217;s journey through hair loss as she battled breast cancer.</p>

<p>I have stayed with the blog, and with Leanne during her ferocious fight against cancer and I&#8217;ve simultaneously watched an army of supporters rally to her side. These days her posts regularly receive upwards of 20 comments.</p>

<p>Some of these commenters are her friends + family. Some of them are others battling cancer. But <em>many</em> of them are folks who stumbled onto the blog, and could never look back. Many comments start with the words &#8220;I&#8217;ve been reading the blog for some time but haven&#8217;t commented until now&#8221; But those who have not had the good fortune of meeting Leanne face to face are no less dedicated to making sure she can one day say the words &#8220;<em>and then one day the cancer was just gone.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>A recent post called <a href="http://blog.en.chatelaine.com/living-with-breast-cancer/stop-the-ride-i-want-to-get-off/">Stop the Ride I Want to Get Off </a>in which Leanne rages against the cancer-treatment machine&#8217;s inability to help her manage treatment outside the system attracted two posts from virtual strangers. One said <em>&#8220;A lot of stranger-friends in the blogosphere are rooting for you!</em>&#8221; and the other &#8220;<em>Another stranger reading your blog here</em>&#8221; both of which provided helpful, practical information about finding clinical trials.</p>

<p>Leanne&#8217;s army of supporters have now mobilized around Leanne&#8217;s Clinical Trial trials&#8211;offering advice, support, sharing Leanne&#8217;s anger and frustration.  After one of Leanne&#8217;s posts outlining the lonely and overwhelming <a href="http://blog.en.chatelaine.com/living-with-breast-cancer/full-time-job/#comments">full time job </a>that is searching for clinical trails, one reader stood up and asked:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know this sound odd, but is there anything Chatelaine can do? You’d think a media entity of that size could turn this into a larger story and effect your ability to get into a trial? If anyone from Chatelaine is reading this —chop chop. (Please).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are those who would claim that social media offers nothing more than the promise of weak bonds. To those people I would say the community that circled around Leanne demonstrates the best in humankind. At it&#8217;s core, social media is just another human form of engagement that offers the possibility of <em>deep</em> attachments. Like many of the people who read the site, I often check back several times a day to hear any updates about a woman who now is part of my daily life.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re ever feeling cynical about the power of social media, or frankly about humanity in general, read <a href="http://blog.en.chatelaine.com/category/living-with-breast-cancer/">Leanne&#8217;s blog </a>and watch as the friends who have circled around her have the pleasure of reading the post that says &#8220;and one day the cancer was just gone.&#8221;</p>
