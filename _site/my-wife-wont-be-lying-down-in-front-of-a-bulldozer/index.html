  <h1 class="post-title">My wife won&#8217;t be lying down in front of a bulldozer</h1>
  <span class="post-date">25 Nov 2012</span>
  <span class="post-author"></span>
  <p>A couple of years ago, Jodi and I were invited to an event called &#8220;Downstream Downtown&#8221; by a coalition of partners opposed to the proposed development of an aggregate MegaQuarry in Melancthon, north west of the city.</p>

<p>The project was tainted from the start:</p>

<ul>
<li>  The scale was off the charts–20 football fields of soil removed, and the proces essentially a science experiment</li>
<li>  The soil in question is some of the best in the world</li>
<li>  It&#8217;s located at a series of headwaters that supply water to over a million people, and, deeper than Niagara falls is high, would dig below the water table</li>
<li>  Run by  Massachusetts based Hedge Fund named the Baupost Group</li>
<li>  Through a local organization who bought up prime land by posing as potato farmers</li>
<li>  The Baupost Group hires Hill &amp; Knowlton, a classic &#8216;spin anyone/thing&#8217; PR factory that casts a poor light on the industry</li>
</ul>

<p>As the story unfolded and we became personally invested, I&#8217;d hear Jodi describe it to people as the kind of thing you stand in front of a bulldozer for.</p>

<p>But the forces of good were never more than a step behind:</p>

<ul>
<li>  A farmer named Carl Cossack poked around and started asking questions, then rallying support</li>
<li>  Teams organized in the region and in the city</li>
<li>  The group divided their outreach/awareness into communities of interest (Downtown Downstream was a focus on people aware of and interested in food issues, I was also invited to an event focussed on water issues)</li>
<li>  We went back to the office and made the NoMegaQuarry team a website and Infographic, and started teaching people about the issue ourselves</li>
<li>  The Canadian Chef&#8217;s Congress, led by local farmer/Celebrity Chef Michael Stadtlander organized a fund and awareness rally that drew 72 chefs, a range of awesome musicians and 20,000 people to Foodstock, a field and forest food and music fest in wind and rain (this should have been the first indication that Hill &amp; Knowlton&#8217;s PR machine was up against a project that Ontarians didn&#8217;t want)</li>
<li>   The day before the event, the Ontario Minister of the Environment called for an environmental assessment, delaying the project</li>
<li>  Fast forward to Soupstock a few weeks ago and the involvement of the David Suzuki Foundation–our pal Faisal got back to the foundations&#8217; roots with a bit of rabble–rousing, to a crowd of 40K (over the course of the day)</li>
<li>  Mid-week,in a masterfully understated press release, we got the news that the Baupost Group felt there wasn&#8217;t enough support among locals or from the government, and that they were pulling the plug</li>
</ul>

<p>When we first heard about the project, we went through the emotional range you&#8217;d expect to when confronted with prospective large scale injustice we were helpless to address.</p>

<p>Then we addressed it.</p>

<p>A lot of people did a lot of things, some little some big. All critical. We came face to face with a prospective greed-made environmental disaster. It was chilling and, truth be told, the result was surprising. I thought this was going to be fought for a while.</p>

<p>I guess the lesson is that the only thing we know for sure is that if we didn&#8217;t get involved–if people didn&#8217;t put signs on their lawns, come out to events, tell their friends and pitch in their unique skills–we&#8217;d never have won.</p>

<p>We had a beer at the office when the news broke. And look out for an official party in mid February. Then, it&#8217;s back to work figuring out how to ensure that our best soil is saved for growing food, that our water is protected, and maybe that we put some of our ingenuity to use looking for modern takes on aggregate.</p>
