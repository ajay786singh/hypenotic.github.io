  <h1 class="post-title">Dying to Shop: Correlating Bad Health and Cheap Stuff</h1>
  <span class="post-date">29 Nov 2010</span>
  <span class="post-author"></span>
  <p>Just started reading a fascinating book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Emperor-All-Maladies-Biography-Cancer/dp/1439107955">The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer </a>that traces the history of the elusive disease and its treatments. In it, the author Sidhartha Mukherjee talks about dramatic medical  developments that lead to current cancer treatments.</p>

<p>Mukherjee claims that the widepread purchaing of &#8220;durables&#8221; from the 1920&#8242;s onward coincided with a rapid increase in the number and kind of drugs that dramatically lengthened people&#8217;s lifespan and their sense of immortality. It&#8217;s hard to believe, but life expectancy for Americans rose from fourty-seven to sixty-eight in the first half of the 20th century.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;A young generation thus dreamed of cures&#8211;of a death free, disease free existence. Lullued by the idea of the durability of life, they threw themselves into consuming durables&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, people bought <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studebaker">Studebakers</a> and TV&#8217;s because they suddenly felt like they were going to live forever&#8211;or at least for a long, long time. So they invested stuff that would be around too.</p>

<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-3859" href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/3857/3857/attachment/screen-shot-2010-11-29-at-11-06-41-am"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3859" title="Screen shot 2010-11-29 at 11.06.41 AM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Screen-shot-2010-11-29-at-11.06.41-AM-250x250.png" alt="" width="250" height="250" /></a></p>

<p>So what does it say about our current state of mind that we live in a disposable culture? Whenever I find myself in a &#8216;big box&#8217; store, I&#8217;m stunned by the sheer quantity of junk people are willing to pay hard earned money for. Of course that effect is amplified during holiday season.</p>

<p>Last week, my friend <a href="http://www.fashiontakesaction.com/content/about/founder/72-founder-a-president-kelly-drennan">Kelly Drennan</a>, founder of Fashion Takes Action posted <a href="http://www.thestar.com/living/article/874727--fast-fashion-pricing-hits-new-lows">this article</a> on her Facebook page that that talks about how cheap fashionable clothes are these days. Cheapness in the price of clothes is of course accompanied by low quality. But no one seems to mind. The article quotes one woman&#8217;s reaction to her cheap summer dresses falling apart after only one season of wear:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Usually for those kinds of things I don&#8217;t even consider really whether or not I&#8217;ll have them around for next summer,” she says. “If I do, great. If not, because they were so cheap it almost doesn&#8217;t really matter.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it a coincidence that our culture of consumption is accompanied by a health crisis? Diabetes, cancer, obesity, etc. are all on the rise and we&#8217;re buying more and more disposable crap. Is our sense of mortality causing us to become a more disposable culture?</p>

<p>We deliberately turn a blind eye to the fact that all this stuff is literally killing us and the planet&#8211;so perhaps it&#8217;s a vicious cycle. More stuff=bad health=more stuff. And on and on and on.</p>

<p>Have a look at <a href="http://www.storyofstuff.com/">The Story of Stuff</a> for a quick Coles Notes version of how the materials economy works:  </p>

<p>Last week, I came across an article called <a href="http://www.livingprinciples.org/new-relationships-with-our-stuff/">New Relationships with our Stuff</a> that posits a new movement is afoot. Websites like <a href="http://neighborgoods.net/">Neighbourgoods </a>and <a href="http://snapgoods.com/">Snapgoods </a>allow people to borrow, rent and sell  things they they already have rather than getting them new from a store. The local, artisinal and craft movements are also evidence of this shift.</p>

<p>Does it mean we&#8217;re feeling more immortal? Is this an effort to get back to a time when things were more solid and predictable rather than temporal and fleeting? Are we seeking better health? Better lives? Less stuff?</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a conference in San Fransisco in January where these issues will be the central focus of discussion. It&#8217;s called <a href="http://compostmodern.org/">Compostmodern</a>, and I&#8217;m thinking about checking it out. Anyone want to come?</p>
