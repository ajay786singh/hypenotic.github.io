        The Westjet experience

    <p>My loyalty to and likelihood of evangelizing for a given organization is directly proportional to the quality of the experience inherent in basic interactions with them. Stuff like waiting on the phone. Seth Godin says &#8220;your brand is your return policy.&#8221; In that your brand is what people think of you, I agree.</p>

<p>Westjet must agree too.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never met their executives, engineers, mechanics or pilots. I don&#8217;t recall their marketing materials. And in economy, planes are planes, the seats are cramped and the the food isn&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve only really ever interacted with one of their customer touchpoints–their flight attendants. But the experience has been so consistently memorable that I now realize it&#8217;s a business strategy. Someone clued in to the fact that air-travel is imperfect, and the only influence they had over the experience was attitude. Theirs is swell.</p>

<p>And they look twice as good because Air Canada sucks. With enemies like AC, who needs friends?</p>

<p>I bet they&#8217;d be happy to know how my family and I feel about traveling with them. I bet they&#8217;d be happier to hear how many people I&#8217;ve told and how many of them agreed with me about the Westjet expereince. And I bet they&#8217;d never admit it, but I&#8217;m sure that deep down they&#8217;d be happy to hear how many of the people I&#8217;ve discussed this with agreed with me about the Air Canada experience.</p>
