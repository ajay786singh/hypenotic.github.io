        A Formula to Deliver Information with Impact

  <a href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9868/the-best-brochure-youll-ever-see/attachment/screen-shot-2012-09-20-at-5-08-58-pm" rel="attachment wp-att-9880"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9880" title="Screen shot 2012-09-20 at 5.08.58 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screen-shot-2012-09-20-at-5.08.58-PM.png" alt="" width="492" height="260" /></a>
</p>

<p>In 2010, <a href="http://www.changemakers.com/">Ashoka</a> came out with a brochure all about their impact as an organization. I just found it on my desk. Turns out it&#8217;s one of the best pieces of printed material I&#8217;ve seen for a long, long time. It&#8217;s not because the photographs are beautiful (in fact there are only a few tiny photos in the brochure) and its not because it&#8217;s big and glossy.</p>

<p>This brochure is awesome because it clearly and convincingly articulates the impact Ashoka Fellows have in changing the world.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s why you should pay attention:</p>

<ul>
<li>  <strong>It&#8217;s Clear: </strong>In the President&#8217;s letter which creates the context for the brochure, she describes Ashoka Fellows&#8217; initiatives in a way I hear few non-profits speak. She speaks clearly in jargon-free language that simply makes sense. Notice colloquial expressions like &#8220;knock out test&#8221; and concrete examples that make it absolutely clear what Ashoka stands for (and what they don&#8217;t).</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>The knock-out test for electing Ashoka Fellows and for starting new Ashoka initiatives is the same: there needs to be a system change idea in the hands of an entrepreneur. Rather than looking to someone who is building one school or one hospital, Ashoka looks for individuals who are changing the way children learn or the way healthcare is delivered.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>  <strong><span style="line-height: 13px;">It&#8217;s Concrete: </span></strong><span style="line-height: 13px;">Every non profit wants to discuss impact. Many have a lot of anecdotal ways of measuring and reflecting their impact (like heartfelt testimonials), but Ashoka took the time to undertake a survey and shared the data that proves the effect they&#8217;re having in the world. The survey defined five ways their Fellows make an impact and dug deeper to provide insights that help the data take shape. Below you see an example of the high level data, and one example of how they probe their impact in one of the five issue areas (Public Policy &amp; Industry Norms)</span></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9868/the-best-brochure-youll-ever-see/attachment/screen-shot-2012-09-20-at-5-03-03-pm" rel="attachment wp-att-9875"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9875" title="Screen shot 2012-09-20 at 5.03.03 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screen-shot-2012-09-20-at-5.03.03-PM.png" alt="" width="300" height="436" /></a></p>

<ul>
<li>  <strong>It&#8217;s Human: </strong>Often research reports like this are data heavy, lacking the &#8220;touchy-feely&#8221; qualities that bring people closer to the issues. But this brochure does a wonderful job balancing information with emotion. For example, under the system change they call &#8220;Full Citizenship &amp; Empathic Ethics&#8221; they feature a graph outlining how they measure this particular area. Importantly though, they also include the first person account of one Fellow named <a href="http://www.ashoka.org/node/3384">Raquel Barros</a> who has helped transform the lives of abused women in Brazil through her work with an organization called Lua Nova here&#8217;s an example of her account:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>I knew that in order to open real opportunities for them [the women] to fully re-integrate into mainstream society, Lua Nova need to work with other organizations&#8230;.If I wanted their silent voices to be heard, if I wanted to attract society&#8217;s attention, Lua Nova couldn&#8217;t be alone.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>  <strong>It&#8217;s Visual:</strong> Ashoka doesn&#8217;t just visualize data, they visualize how Ashoka Fellows are creating fundamental &#8220;system change ideas,&#8221; bringing it full-circle back to the President&#8217;s opening statement about what Ashoka is all about. In the case of Ashoka Fellow Raquel Barros&#8217; impact, they created a simple infographic that brings the change she created to life in a way that is easy to understand.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9868/the-best-brochure-youll-ever-see/attachment/screen-shot-2012-09-20-at-4-55-58-pm" rel="attachment wp-att-9871"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9871" title="Screen shot 2012-09-20 at 4.55.58 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screen-shot-2012-09-20-at-4.55.58-PM.png" alt="" width="283" height="445" /></a></p>

<p>The brochure provides a great formula for non profits to share their impact and make it relevant; be clear, concrete, human and visual.</p>

<p>Turns out that the Ashoka Foundation is just as good at expressing change as Ashoka Fellows are at making it happen on the ground.</p>

<p>Kudos!</p>
