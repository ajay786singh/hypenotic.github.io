  <p><a rel="attachment wp-att-2269" href="http://hypenotic.com/branding/2245/non/attachment/screen-shot-2010-04-20-at-2-36-35-pm"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2269" title="Screen shot 2010-04-20 at 2.36.35 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-20-at-2.36.35-PM.png" alt="" width="380" height="245" /></a>I&#8217;m tired of apologies. These days everyone apologizes far too frequently and without a shred of sincerity. Make a racist comment? Apologize. Cheat on your wife? Apologize. Lie, cheat, steal. Apologize.</p>

<p>I believe there&#8217;s alot to be said for *not *apologizing. What a refreshing gesture.  It takes integrity to not apologize.  One guy who understood integrity and proved the power of not apologizing was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lennon">John Lennon</a>. When in a 1966 interview he told reporters  that the Beatles were more popular than Jesus adding &#8220;I don&#8217;t know which will go first&#8211;rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll or Christianity,&#8221; he stood behind them fight&#8217;n words<span style="color: #222222;"><span style="line-height: 25px; font-size: small;">. Even as US radio stations banned the Beatles&#8217; music and teenagers burned their records, Lennon refused to relent. </span></span></p>

<p>Lennon was sorry that people misunderstood his message. But he was not sorry he said the Beatles were bigger than Jesus. Fact is they were.  In fact later in life, Lennon said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #222222;"><span style="line-height: 25px; font-size: small;"><em> &#8220;I always remember to thank Jesus for the end of my touring days; if I hadn&#8217;t said that The Beatles were &#8216;bigger than Jesus&#8217; and upset the very Christian Ku Klux Klan well, Lord, I might still be up there with all the other performing fleas! God bless America. Thank you, Jesus.&#8221;</em></span></span></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span style="color: #222222; line-height: 25px;">Consider all the the things you can  be <em>not</em> doing that would speak to your brand&#8217;s integrity:</span></p>

<ul>
<li>  <span style="color: #222222;"><span style="line-height: 25px;"><strong>You can <em>never, ever </em></strong><strong>put your product on sale.</strong> If it&#8217;s an artisinal product why should you ever mark it down? This <a href="http://forum.purseblog.com/handbags-and-purses/list-of-brands-that-never-go-on-sale-35118.html">purse blog</a> lists the brands of purses that never go on sale: Louis Vuitton and Hermes are among them. Could you imagine a Vuitton bag on sale? Me neither. </span></span></li>
<li>  <span style="color: #222222;"><span style="line-height: 25px;"><strong>You can <em>refuse </em></strong><strong>to let the customer be right.</strong> Toronto&#8217;s famed Southern Italian restaurant <a href="http://www.terroni.ca/">Terroni </a>has been widely criticized for refusing to cut pizza before serving, never putting parmesan cheese on certain types of pasta, and not letting customers have butter with their bread even though the kitchen has butter. They are authentically and staunchly Southern Italian and if you don&#8217;t like it, you can go eat elsewhere. </span></span></li>
<li>  <span style="color: #222222;"><span style="line-height: 25px;"><strong>You could <em>not </em>play nice. </strong>For years Coke and Pepsi had a battle of the brands. One would make an ad, the other would create a better ad, and so it went. Then in 1975 the gloves came off. Pepsi didn&#8217;t want to play nice anymore.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi_Challenge"> The Pepsi Challenge</a> was a way of taking the fight out of the ring and into the street where things could get a little messy.  Same thing with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpOvzGiheOM">those clever Apple ads</a>. They put PC front and centre and humiliated him. Not nice, but<em> man</em> does it ever work. </span></span>
