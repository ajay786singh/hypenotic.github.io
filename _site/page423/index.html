        Shit No One Needs: Vinyl Conference Folders

    <p><a rel="attachment wp-att-2495" href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/2484/shit-no-one-needs-vinyl-conference-folders/attachment/screen-shot-2010-06-03-at-11-02-10-am-2"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2495" title="Screen shot 2010-06-03 at 11.02.10 AM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Screen-shot-2010-06-03-at-11.02.10-AM1.png" alt="" width="256" height="391" /></a>They&#8217;re as ubiquitous as the name-on-a-string you wear around your neck at a conference. And, there&#8217;s no good reason for their existence. PVC Conference Folders with a logo proudly emblazoned on the front. They say just one thing about the conference host&#8211;they just couldn&#8217;t be bothered.</p>

<p>Yes, it&#8217;s handy to have some paper to jot down notes at a conference. And there are an endless number of  promotions companies who can&#8217;t wait to sell you their cheap, plastic conference folders and accompanying pen. 100 clipboards&#8217;ll run you $7.50 + a $60 set up fee. They can pump &#8216;em out like hotcakes. Or, like widgets. Pick your metaphor. But there&#8217;s one problem. They suck. Hard.</p>

<p>At Hypenotic headquarters, we&#8217;re used to asking, &#8216;why?&#8217; Why a brochure? Why a website? Why a conference? When we questioned our client&#8217;s (the &#8216;raddest of the rad&#8217; <a href="http://push.ca/blogs/pete/archive/2009/06/16/matt-houghton-action-sports-media-renaissance-man.aspx">Matt Houghton</a>) first instinct to give away vinyl folders he was immediately primed to switch gears. This was a guy who understood the value of authenticity better than anyone.</p>

<p>We were helping Matt put together a Media Lab for <a href="http://www.push.ca/">Push.ca</a>, a Sympatico portal that is the most authentic Canadian voice on Skateboarding and Snowboarding. Push.ca was hosting the Media Lab to show potential advertisers Push.ca had the right people, content and ideas to speak to this niche audience.</p>

<p>The scene was set to give the attendees an experience that was as cool as this culture. We reserved the <a href="http://www.gladstonehotel.com/about">Gladstone Hotel</a>, ordered upscale street food like nachos and grilled cheese sandwiches, and had the hottest lineup of former pros turned marketers to lend insight.</p>

<p>Instead of a vinyl conference folder, we came up with an environmentally friendly pad, with each cover hand screened with the Push.ca logo. The pads were screened by <a href="http://www.thebaitshop.ca/">The Bait Shop</a>, a spot so invested in skate culture that they have a half pipe in their showroom. Beyond the half pipe, their space features a  printshop and gallery. We further featured the Bait Shops&#8217; skills by having them screenprint Push.ca t-shirts on site during the Media Lab, in full view of the participants. It was cool eye candy. When folks walked in, they were asked what colour shirt and what colour screen print they wanted. And, at the end of the day, they walked away with something authentic and hand rendered.</p>

<p>So, tell me again why you were thinking about getting one of those vinyl conference folders?</p>
