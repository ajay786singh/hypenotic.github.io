  <p>Hypenotic: Just another* purpose-driven Marketing Strategy, Design and Development firm.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re a founding Canadian <a href="http://www.bcorporation.net/">B Corp</a> on a mission to manifest a more &#8216;Generative Economy&#8217;. Beyond &#8216;Sustainable&#8217;, a &#8216;Generative&#8217; approach looks for opportunities to spark other positive returns. <span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5em;">Since &#8217;98, we&#8217;ve helped brands who take the impact of how they make their margins into account turn their mission into their marketing and their marketing into engaging communications and user-experiences.</span></p>

<p>Over the years, we&#8217;ve realized that a few key ingredients produce the most consistently effective results.</p>

<ol>
<li> *<em>Being mission-driven: *</em>Everything we work on starts by clearly articulating the problem in a way that could matter to other people. In our increasingly media-saturated era, we&#8217;re filtering marketing messages and getting better at finding the news, solutions and partners broadcasting on our frequency.</li>
<li> <strong>A subtractive process:</strong> We use your mission to inform our strategies and tactics. If yours isn&#8217;t clearly articulated, we start there. We use a subtractive method (like removing material from a sculpture to reveal the form within) to define project goals and parameters. That is, we don&#8217;t show up and tell you the answers, we bring processes to find the answers with you.</li>
<li> <strong>A partnership approach: </strong>We consider our clients co-creators, and include them in every stage of the process. As we learn about you and your space, you become better informed modern marketing strategy, design and development partners.</li>
<li> <strong>User-centred design: </strong>Ultimately, the people who need to notice, interact with and share what we create are your clients, prospects and peers. They may be, but aren&#8217;t necessarily like you. We help you shape offerings tuned to a frequency they&#8217;re listening for and will hear above the din.</li>
<li> <strong>An agile-sprinted process: </strong>We learn the most by doing, so our projects benefit from an agile approach that combines small, regular strategy and review sessions with small sprints of work in between. This process allows us to take advantage of inspiration as it arises and delivers value at each stage.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Values: With great power&#8230;</h4>

<p>Design is a powerful tool. It forces you to focus. It informs. It persuades. We don&#8217;t take our role in using this power lightly. If we&#8217;re going to influence the way people perceive and interact, purchase, share and vote, we want to do it on behalf of people doing things that matter. People, ideally, who actively consider what social good they can <em>generate</em> on their road to a healthy bottom line.</p>

<h4>Gamut: Our own kind of unicorn</h4>

<p>There are great, socially-bent strategy firms out there. We have no shortage of design heroes to admire. And we&#8217;re inspired by the trailblazing developers inventing the next web daily. But we&#8217;ve yet to come across a company whose range spans all three of those qualities. So we do. We use design thinking and doing to solve business and social problems and wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way.</p>

<p>Now that you know a bit about us, maybe you&#8217;d like to <a href="http://hypenotic.com/contact/" title="Contact">run a problem by us</a>?</p>

<p>*<em>Is there another one?</em></p>
