        Feeling Salty

    <span class="post-date">02 Mar 2010</span>

    <p>Knorr has reduced the sodium in many of its products. To announce the change they&#8217;ve introduced a character named &#8216;Salty&#8217; into their ads and social media campaign. The ads are the personification of cuteness. Who could resist the moment when the salt pours out of his eyes in place of tears?</p>

<p>The idea to personify Salty and generate sympathy for him is really good. And the TV spots do a great job of being funny and original, and making something as mundane as salt reduction worth talking about at the water cooler. Kudos to <a href="http://www.ddbcanada.com/noflash.html">DDB Canada</a>.</p>

<p>In the social media department, Salty has posted some pretty awesome pictures of himself on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/SaltysLife">Facebook</a>, like his most recent <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=5118769&amp;id=230396269151&amp;fbid=364321149151">Olympic adventure</a> (so patriotic). The Facebook and Twitter campaigns called *SaltysLife *are intended to bring the tiny figure to life. The dedicated <a href="http://www.sidekicks.ca/sodium101.aspx">Sidekicks sitelette </a> invites us to &#8220;Follow Salty on His Adventures.&#8221;</p>

<p>But, do I want to? What would I get by following or friending Salty?  A novel, funny ad does not easily translate into a solid or &#8220;follow-worthy&#8221; social media campaign.</p>

<p>My first contact with Salty was on Twitter when I noticed he was following me. When I checked out his Tweets, I found him very self-centered. Just links to Facebook pictures of him, some Knorr product and recipes. If I&#8217;m going to follow someone on Twitter (even a fictional character) then I want that person to be fully dimensional. And, Twitter is the perfect medium for Salty to tell us what he&#8217;s up to since he lost the Knorr gig and the stuff he cares about. Here are a few potential SaltysLife Tweets that would bring the little fellow to life in a funny, shareworthy way.</p>

<ul>
<li>  Hydration is overrated people. Eat more salt!</li>
<li>  Watching the Olympics live in Vancouver was no fun. Just alot of shoes.</li>
<li>  Got ice to melt? I&#8217;m available!</li>
</ul>

<p>Beyond that like all good Tweeters, Salty&#8217;s Tweets need to be more useful and relevant. How? By sharing useful information about salt, even if it&#8217;s laced with Salty&#8217;s disappointment with the &#8220;propaganda&#8221; coming out against him. If I was Salty&#8217;s social media mentor I&#8217;d advise the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Link to important research about Salt, like <a href="http://bigthink.com/ideas/18347">this video by Marion Nestle</a> (Salty Tweets  &#8220;Who believes Marion Nestle anyway. What is she like an expert or something?&#8221;)</li>
<li>  Talk about the health benefits of Pepper <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/blackpepper">like this article does </a> (Salty Tweets &#8220;Look at how my so-called-friend Pep is stealing the limelight&#8221;)</li>
<li>  Highlight the health benefits of salt reduction (Salty Tweets &#8220;Don&#8217;t act like you don&#8217;t like bloat. Don&#8217;t believe the hype about salt reduction&#8221;)</li>
</ul>

<p>There you go Salty, you&#8217;re no longer jobless. Now you&#8217;ve got your work cut out for you.</p>
