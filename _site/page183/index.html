        Retailer Says &#8216;Stop Shopping.&#8217;

    <span class="post-date">22 Mar 2012</span>

    <p>With the weather changing I&#8217;m suddenly hyper aware of all of the new bright spring clothes jaunting up and down the sidewalk. Bright pink skinny belts and matching loafers and the like.</p>

<p>While the clothes are optimistic, I can&#8217;t help letting a gnawing cynicism creep in. There&#8217;s no doubt that a lot of the garb I&#8217;m seeing comes from stores like H&amp;M and Urban Outfitters&#8211;stores that sell trendiness at high volumes and at the lowest possible cost. These are clothes with a miniscule life cycle&#8211;built to not last.</p>

<p>However, if you own a Patagonia spring jacket or fleece, chances are you&#8217;ve had it or plan to hold onto it for a while. Still, there&#8217;s an inherent irony built into a store that promotes engaging with the outdoors and nature and, at the end of the day, encourages folks to buy more stuff that consumes energy and ruins that natural world.</p>

<p>Recently Patagonia looked this contradiction straight in the eye and found the courage to address it. Patagonia took<a href="http://www.patagonia.com/us/common-threads/#"> a bold move</a> by asking customers to buy less and extend the lifecycle of their products for as long as possible in order to &#8220;own up to all the harm we do and do our best to put an end to it.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://hypenotic.com/branding/8904/are-they-crazy-patagonia-says-stop-buying-stuff/attachment/screen-shot-2012-03-22-at-3-46-12-pm" rel="attachment wp-att-8907"><img title="Screen shot 2012-03-22 at 3.46.12 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-shot-2012-03-22-at-3.46.12-PM.png" alt="" width="390" height="494" /></a></p>

<p>Patagonia courageously calls for &#8220;a new economy&#8221; which is focused on reducing overall consumption of things we don&#8217;t need&#8211;their products included. CEO Rick Ridgeway puts it this way:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fundamental assumption that we can continue on a growth economy is flawed in the long term. We need to start talking about what we are going to do about it.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Corporate philanthropy is usually about providing feel-good bandaid solutions to systemic problems. It&#8217;s rare for a manufacturer/retailer to question fundamental, underpinning systems as big as capitalism. But, like us <a href="http://www.bcorporation.net/index.cfm/nodeID/F432CEBC-6C80-4F75-B1B6-0E7C1E7451F2/fuseaction/content.page">Patagonia is a B Corp</a>, so questioning how things are done is in their DNA.</p>

<p>And while they&#8217;re helping reimagine Capitalism, they&#8217;re taking steps to make sure they&#8217;re doing what they can to limit impact their clothes have on the environment. Patagonia has taken the following steps on their mission:</p>

<ul>
<li>  They offer to repair any ripped or damaged clothes for a small fee on 10 day turn around</li>
<li>  They help you sell your used Patagonia clothes via their <a href="http://www.patagonia.com/us/ebay/used-gear">branded Ebay Channel</a> and their own <a href="http://www.patagonia.com/us/ebay/used-gear">used clothing store</a></li>
<li>  They provide links to resources that make the case for reducing consumption like <a href="http://www.storyofstuff.org/">The Story of Stuff</a></li>
<li>  Offers a detailed care guide to empower customers to make their Patagonia stuff last a long, long time</li>
</ul>

  Here&#8217;s a video manifesto they put together calling for a different kind of economy.

<p>How do you manage to buy less? Do you think Patagonia is being hypocritical?</p>
