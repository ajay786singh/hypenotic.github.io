        Google Pages launches. Another social media space to look after.
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Nov 2011</span>

    <p>Google Pages launched today and I&#8217;m already feeling a little tired.  A little social media saturated shall we say.  I mean how many social media properties do you really need?   How many can you properly curate at one time? </p>

<p>Usually I would be excited by this and be the first to jump in with both feet, but isn&#8217;t it getting out of hand? If Google had come out with a completely new re-imaged, mind-blowing way of connecting people to businesses that is one thing, but it&#8217;s the same old stuff. It&#8217;s just another flavour of ice-cream. But that&#8217;s the thing. Regardless of the flavour it is still just ice-cream. Facebook, Google+, Twitter, Linkedin and the list goes on.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-7530" title="social-network-similarities" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/social-network-similarities-580x295.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="295" /></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;So far Google+ has focused on connecting people with other people. But we want to make sure you can build relationships with all the things you care about—from local businesses to global brands—so today we’re rolling out Google+ Pages worldwide. For businesses and brands, Google+ pages help you connect with the customers and fans who love you. Not only can they recommend you with a +1, or add you to a circle to listen long-term. They can actually spend time with your team, face-to-face-to-face. All you need to do is start sharing, and you&#8217;ll soon find the super fans and loyal customers that want to say hello.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hmmm&#8230;kinda sounds familiar, doesn&#8217;t it? With a little copy editing this description could work for Facebook Pages or for Linkedin&#8217;s Company Profiles or for the other 200 or so major social media spaces out there that offer branded pages for businesses.  I feel like we should pull a Steve Jobs on the social media landscape.  When Apple was only a couple of months away from bankrupcy, Jobs was brought back in to resuscitate the company. One of the first things he did was slash the 350 products that Apple was selling at the time down to 10.</p>

<p>Quality not quantity was the answer. Instead of selling everything to everybody, cut the field down to a few, but make the few really, really great. And while we do that why not also take a page from what <a href="http://hypenotic.com/technology/7267/prismatic-identity-social-networkings-next-challenge">Chris Poole said at the Web 2.0 summit last month</a> and re-imagine how social media works.</p>

<p>To be fair, I will probably play around with Google Pages and there will be a Pages company profile created. But today I think I&#8217;ll stick with Louis C.K and get my head out of the screen and pick up the phone and talk to a client.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>
