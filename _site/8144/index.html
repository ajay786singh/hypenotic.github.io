<p>New moms often claim &#8220;nobody told me&#8221; about the many unappealing parts of motherhood. However,  I&#8217;m starting think that the &#8220;nobody told me&#8221; claim is a slice of pure Oscar Meyer&#8217;s bologna. Before you try to strangle me (especially you who, exhausted looking mom foaming at the mouth), hear me out.</p>

<p>Yes, I get that no one told you:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Breastfeeding would be so hard</li>
<li>  Being a parent is fucking exhausting</li>
<li>  You will likely have moments where you want to  throw the kid out the window or politely return her to the hospital murmuring &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I think I&#8217;ve made a terrible mistake&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<p>But why would you know this stuff before it was relevant to you? Face it, even if someone told you, you wouldn&#8217;t have been the least bit interested when you were busy living* t<em>he free and easy</em> vida loca*. Sure if we grew up in multi-generational families you may have had an inkling of how breastfeeding actually worked, but that&#8217;s not the world most of us live in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today, we are all living on a need to know basis. And with the internet at hand, it&#8217;s not so bad.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now that I have a new Australian Sheppard puppy named Blue I find myself feeling the &#8220;nobody told me&#8221; feeling coming on.</p>

<ul>
<li>  Nobody told me toilet training takes so long</li>
<li>  Nobody told me how you have to teach a dog to walk on a leash</li>
<li>  Nobody told me how mentally exhausting it is watching your dog trying to decide if you need to go outside (yet again) only to have him shit the moment you bring him back inside</li>
</ul>

<p>But, now I need to know, and so I do (well, starting to anyway).</p>

<p>Puppy ownership has thrust me into an entirely new community of interest. In this new community (where you have to watch where you step)  I can access all kinds of information I never needed to know before.  I can lock eyes with other dog owners and share a moment of shared identification; My google and youtube searches have taken a new turn; will make dog friends, write annoying puppy-centric facebook posts and call my male dog &#8216;buddy&#8217; (which even I find annoying).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My identity profile has changed. I&#8217;ve joined a new specialized group. Hear me bark.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#8217;s my latest favorite video on how to walk a dog&#8211;walk a dog? Nobody told me. Hey Buddy, how &#8217;bout you just <em>walk</em>?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So now I&#8217;m a member of a whole new community of interest&#8211;Aussie puppy owner. If you see me walking Blue down the street, waiting patiently for him to decide to start walking again  (as I look over my right shoulder without saying a word or making a noise) feel free to say hello, or better yet, offer us a ride.</p>
