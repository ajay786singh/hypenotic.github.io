  <p>Nobody likes writing about themselves.  I took an informal poll this afternoon when I ran into a friend on the streetcar (that way I wouldn&#8217;t have to do the math on the margin of error.)   It can easily come across as dry or as a #humblebrag  (or just bragging) and for those of us who are big into the self-deprecating it feels a little naked. (Both my Twitter feed and Facebook accounts are anonymous.)</p>

<p>I have had more than one career; I&#8217;ve actually had several since I started working at 12 (I was a babysitter, and certified too).  I&#8217;ve worked in film, personal shopping, and retail and now I&#8217;m making another jump into marketing.  I&#8217;m not one of those people who has known their whole life what they were destined to do.  Except I have always had a passion for strange products and well done marketing.</p>

<p>The last time I was in an American supermarket I was compelled to take home a bottle of Mr. Sprinkles.  Wouldn&#8217;t you have loved to be in on that meeting?  I&#8217;m sure it happened sometime in the 60&#8242;s or 70&#8242;s ; it has to be some of my favorite packaging.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6705" title="Mr. Sprinkles!" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/2686662609_78b0fdde381.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></p>

<p>I also come from good union stock.  I was on my first picket line at 9 months; my Dad still has my picket card.  I&#8217;ve never been to Canada&#8217;s Wonderland because they kicked IATSE out in the 80&#8242;s.</p>

<p>I have a huge shoe collection (shopping problem) but I vote NDP and try not to support businesses that don&#8217;t share my values.  And when a friend (thanks Andreas!) recommended me to Hypenotic I thought it would be an excellent place to gain some solid marketing chops. And that is how I became the 35 year old intern, now let’s just hope no one tries the coffee.</p>
