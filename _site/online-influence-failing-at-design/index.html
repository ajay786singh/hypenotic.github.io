  <p><em><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5938" title="inbox_new" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/inbox_new1.jpg" alt="" width="226" height="181" />I get a ton of content flowing through my inbox on a weekly basis. Between work and personal emails, newsletters always seem to drift down and fall off my radar. Actually, I do scan about 50% that catch my eye, that&#8217;s not to say that the other 50% are bad, it&#8217;s just that, well, I only have so many hours. There&#8217;s so much great content out in webby land that it&#8217;s often hard to filter, focus and internalize all the stuff I&#8217;m consuming. So here are a couple of pieces that hit my inbox this week.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Failing at Design</h2>

<p>Design failures are rarely the result of a bad idea or an unwilling client, it&#8217;s usually a misalignment of expectations. Companies that go into the design process with a clear understanding of the role they play, and a willingness to let their business be transformed by it, typically succeed.</p>

<p>Here are five of the most common ways NOT to fail at design: ** **</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>The smartest companies foster an internal culture of innovation</strong>, which creative consultants can support, but only if other areas of the business, such as management, development, marketing, are also open to change.</li>
<li> <strong>Designers don&#8217;t implement solutions, companies do.</strong> The most innovative solution on earth won&#8217;t work if it&#8217;s pursued by a company that can&#8217;t properly execute it. ****</li>
<li> <strong>Don&#8217;t design for everybody. ** Most of us agree that a Ferrari is beautifully designed, but nobody would say it&#8217;s for everyone. The same could be true of a minivan. Each succeeds because it delivers to a focused group of users. The most useful thing a client can give a consultancy is a well-considered, focused profile of who they&#8217;re designing for. **</strong></li>
<li> <strong>Don&#8217;t try and replicate another company&#8217;s success.</strong> Good design does more than just serve the needs of its audience, it does so in a way that&#8217;s true to the company&#8217;s purpose and values. An Apple-like experience delivered by a company that isn&#8217;t Apple can&#8217;t be sustained, because it&#8217;s not backed up by Apple&#8217;s culture and resources. Not only does it make you look like a copycat, it shows you don&#8217;t care about your own brand enough to express it in your user experience. ****</li>
<li> *<em>It&#8217;s tempting to treat design as a menu of services, applying it here and there on bits of a project. *</em> The best user experiences are integrative; they make sure that every touch point is consistent and logical and building trust with the user. Piecemeal design work creates an incoherent experience that users won&#8217;t like.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Online Influence</h2>

<p>Online influence is measured so that people can know who to trust. It&#8217;s calculated using online activity, taking topics, audience, and level of activity into account. How active people are on social media platforms in important,  but what really boost influence are good assessments from other people about their online activity.</p>

<p>Here are a couple of ways of increasing your online influence.</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Create content that resonates with your audience.</strong> Focus matters. It is hard to be an expert in several subjects, so become known for the subject relevant to you.</li>
<li> <strong>Authentically increase the size of the community you are communicating with</strong>.  The more people in your online community, the more likely that what you are saying will resonate with some of them.</li>
<li> <strong>Do not engage in mutual-follow-back schemes</strong>. Let your reputation spread and let your audience grow organically. Be active; to drive resonance you must be constantly engaging with the people you want to be your audience.</li>
<li> <strong>Make sure you interact with the people who are retweeting you</strong>. If they are leaders then they will talk about your product or service the more you engage with them.</li>
</ol>
