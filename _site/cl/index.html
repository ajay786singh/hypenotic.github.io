  <h1 class="post-title">Fiesta Farms Video #5: Meeting Jessie</h1>
  <span class="post-date">08 Feb 2010</span>
  <span class="post-author"></span>
  <p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1929" title="Jessie" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Jessie-210x130.jpg" alt="Jessie" width="210" height="130" />On Friday Jessie made us real Jamaican <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackee_and_saltfish">Akee and Salt Fish</a>. It was fantastic.</p>

<p>One particularly interesting thing about meeting Jessie (especially since this was the last webisode&#8211;for now), was that she was part of the WTN cooking show <a href="http://www.lovingspoonfuls.com/">Lovin&#8217; Spoonfuls </a>that aired in the early 2000&#8242;s. Hosted by fabulous <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thedavidgale">David Gale</a>, the show was a definite inspiration to us as we considered how to bring <a href="http://www.fiestafarms.ca">Fiesta Farms</a>&#8216; ethnic dimension (it&#8217;s history and product) to life on the site.</p>

<p>Lovin&#8217; Spoonfuls focused on grandmothers and their recipes. And, like the Fiesta Farms series, it featured grannies from around the world. In the episode that featured Jessie, she  made <a href="http://lovingspoonfuls.com/PAGES/REVISED_RECIPES/jessiesalmonrecipe.html">Peas and Rice, Jerk Chicken and Christmas Cake</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1939 aligncenter" title="Screen shot 2010-02-08 at 4.34.38 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Screen-shot-2010-02-08-at-4.34.38-PM2-210x130.png" alt="Screen shot 2010-02-08 at 4.34.38 PM" width="210" height="130" />
</p>

<p>Plainly said, Lovin&#8217; Spoonfuls was way (way, way, way) ahead of it&#8217;s time. As producer Allan Niven says about the grandmothers in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDHs0SCpgaI">story of Lovin Spoonfuls</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These are people who are not often portrayed on television. The tend to be seen as irrelevant&#8230;they were really not portrayed for who they are, which is people with a real body of experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remember now, Lovin&#8217; Spoonfuls <em>predated</em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube">YouTube</a>. In other words, it came <em>before</em> the mass democratization of video content. Before YouTube, there were only 2 kinds of video you could watch in your living room; video filmed professionally (TV, film, etc.) that tended to include rather conventional characters,  and home movies which only you could see, in the privacy of your home.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course YouTube and other sites like Vimeo have made the line between professional and home movies virtually invisible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nowadays anyone with a Flip or an iphone can make a movie that anybody can watch in their living room. And, like everyone else, seniors now have new opportunities to express themselves online.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1928" title="Screen shot 2010-02-08 at 2.14.17 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Screen-shot-2010-02-08-at-2.14.17-PM-210x130.png" alt="Screen shot 2010-02-08 at 2.14.17 PM" width="210" height="130" /></p>

<p>Have you seen the Ottawa version of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeR2BZYT7gM">Raging Grannies taking on Stephen Harper?</a> Or the original <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oNWi8fXOfg">Raging grannies </a>slamming CBS for running pro-life ads on the Superbowl? Well, say no more.</p>

<p>There are a few Grannys whose cooking has taken the internet by storm:</p>

<ul>
<li>  [Clara&#8217;s Depression Era Cooking][10] where Clara cooks affordable food and tells stories from the Depression era</li>
<li>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-s1bkr8iPM">Feed Me Bubbe</a> Kosher cooking set to Klezmer</li>
<li>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH6nuHcVwgg&amp;feature=player_embedded#">Geriatric 1927:</a> Peter Oakley&#8217;s response to Gordon Ramsey&#8217;s Cookalong (watch for the nose picking)</li>
</ul>

<p>There are actually fewer seniors cooking shows than I would have imagined. Perhaps that&#8217;s because not enough have access to the &#8220;means of production&#8221;&#8211; your basic video camera. It&#8217;s incumbent upon younger folks to film their grannies, bubbes, Omas doing their thang. As we all know, when these folks go, their recipes often go with them.</p>

<p>Do you know of other great seniors&#8217; cooking shows? I&#8217;d love to hear about &#8216;em.</p>
