        Coffee, Beer &#038; The Fuck You Economy

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Aug 2012</span>

    <p>I tell people I&#8217;m a coffee snob when they ask why I need to buy coffee from independents instead of Tim Horton&#8217;s or McDonalds. And I tell people I&#8217;m a beer snob as a shorthand explanation for why I choose craft beer.</p>

<p>But I&#8217;m not a snob. I&#8217;m discerning. The difference is that I&#8217;m conscious of the value of what I&#8217;m paying for. And while chain coffee and commercial beer might boast a lower price tag, they&#8217;re still ripping me off. It&#8217;s like a mandate. They&#8217;re in the business of figuring out how to create margins anywhere they can, as long as the customers will still buy it and their risk assessments say they can handle it.</p>

<p>As I understand it, McDonald&#8217;s improved their coffee a couple of years ago when they realized that sucking a bit less could help them take some market share back from Timmie&#8217;s. But the focus is on how little they can get away with rather than how much they can afford to include.</p>

<p>In an economic mindset that focuses on short term shareholder returns instead of long term stakeholder value, the approach makes sense. But I&#8217;ve never been able to get my head around buying from people who are doing their best to screw me.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m grudgingly saying,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll buy this because it&#8217;s cheap and convenient&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and they&#8217;re smiling and saying</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;go fuck yourself, come again!&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think people get this when it comes to a lot of products. You want better fidelity in your speakers or headphones? Get to know the components, try out a bunch, and buy yourself a pair once every few years. But I find it odd that people who drink coffee multiple times/day and beer weekly don&#8217;t stop to consider what they&#8217;re consuming. Is what you put in your ears more important than what you put in your mouth? Or is it that the things you buy the most often are the things you consider the least? It doesn&#8217;t add up.</p>

<p>Hunting down independent coffee shops and craft beers could be considered less convenient, but I&#8217;m increasingly realizing that convenience is over-rated, and has largely been sold to us as a benefit by people making and selling sub-par alternatives. Seeking these things out from someone who differentiate by their careful selection of ingredients and process offers all kinds of returns we&#8217;re not accounting for.</p>

<ul>
<li>  You often get to know the maker, someone who works for the organization, or someone who cares enough about it to stock it</li>
<li>  They taste better. Or at least they don&#8217;t all taste the same</li>
<li>  You&#8217;re contributing to a culture of improvementâ€“people want to make things better for you</li>
<li>  Your&#8217;re usually supporting local entrepreneurs</li>
</ul>

<p>The list goes on, but you get the point. We all choose what consumption we do consciously and where provenance, craft and impact get ignored. I&#8217;d just like to leave you with two questions.</p>

<ol>
<li> If more of us were conscious about more consumption considerations, would it lead to a more sustainable/generative economy?</li>
<li> If you were going to be more conscious about one thing, wouldn&#8217;t food make sense?</li>
</ol>
