<p><a href="http://www.classical963fm.com/">Classical radio&#8217;s 96.3 fm</a>&#8216;s tagline &#8216;Beautiful Music for a Crazy World&#8221; is fabulous.</p>

<p>Listen, only a small number of us will actually go to the Symphony or have a solid Classical music pedigree (I blame my parents for my lack of knowledge in this area); We need a good reason to listen to Classical music. A <a href="http://www.hillstrategies.com/docs/Orchestras_Canada_final.pdf">recent survey</a> by <a href="http://www.hillstrategies.com/">Hill Strategies</a> showed that less than 10 per cent of the Canadian population will attend a live Classical music performance in a given year. The last time I went to the Toronto Symphony Orchestra was when I worked there and I mostly watched old guys snooze. But, I have 96.3 tuned-in on my radio dial. For the most part, I don&#8217;t know my Wagner from my Mozart. But this tagline tells me I don&#8217;t have to. I can listen just to enjoy the beautiful music.</p>

<p>96.3 does not dumb-down Classical music like <a href="http://www.tso.ca/season/ticket/series_detail.cfm?ID=260&amp;SType=36">TSO&#8217;s Pops performances</a> featuring Broadway Classics from <em>My Fair Lady *and</em> The Sound of Music.*They honour their core constituent&#8217;s passion for the art form. But their communications approach to Classical music answers the question &#8220;What&#8217;s in it for me?&#8221;. Is it because we&#8217;re a generation of self-centered assholes that answering this question is so vital? Maybe. But the reality is that the generation of die-hard Classical music performance attendees is aging. The <a href="http://www.hillstrategies.com/docs/Orchestras_Canada_final.pdf">same survey</a> I referred to earlier also shows that 65-74 year olds are twice as likely to go to such a performance as 25-34 year olds. The tagline &#8220;Beautiful Music for a Crazy World&#8221; does not have a trace of cod-liver-oil (you should, you must, you need to) that is bound to send the more youthful set reaching for the radio dial. So, the tagline is 96.3 fm&#8217;s succession plan.</p>

<p>Check out this <a href="http://sharonda.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a57cc926970b0120a5e0e164970b-800wi">little cartoon</a> which demonstrates the extent to which Classical music has been disconnected from marketing. It asks a very poignant question: If you want Classical music to be marketable, why would you title your latest work &#8220;Symphony 57 with Variations in D Minor?&#8221; The cultural sector has been particularly guilty of navel-gazing. For too long they have believed that if they build it we will come. What 96.3 fm gets is that need to tell us why we need to come to Classical music.</p>

<p>However, the execution of this strategy falls short. And the problem rests in the under-leveraging of the brilliant tag line. In their effort to bring the tagline to life, 96.3 fm has animated the ‘beautiful music’ part of their agenda, but let the ‘crazy world’ part wither and atrophy. <a href="http://twitter.com/classical963fm">96.3&#8242;s Twitter account </a>features fun and engaging information about the Classical music world in a light-hearted tone. They have great events like <a href="http://www.classical963fm.com/blog/madama-butterfly">Lobby Concerts </a>and some useful site features like an <a href="http://www.classical963fm.com/arts/calendar">Arts + Events calendar</a><a href="http://www.classical963fm.com/arts/calendar"> </a>and a fun contest like the <a href="http://www.classical963fm.com/antinoisepollution/">Anti-Noise Pollution League </a>to encourage restaurants to play Classical music. Moses invites people to participate and sign his petition by asking “I’ve had it with the <em>boom boom</em>, haven’t you?” All good. But really, it&#8217;s all about the music.</p>

<p>But, I have to ask, where is the crazy? Bring on the crazy! 96.3 fm could really distinguish itself from it&#8217;s serious competitors like <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/radio2/">CBC Radio 2</a> by talking about what is crazy about this world that makes us want to retreat into the universe of Classical music the moment we close the door to our car, home, office, etc. Have you seen this funny <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h-uhoCmyH8">little nugget</a> featuring Mandy Patinkin shining a light on why rude people (“is everyone in this line an asshole?”) make us all crazy? How about using <a href="http://www.classical963fm.com/blog">their blog</a> for fun rants about the repetition of news stories on <a href="http://www.cnn.com/">CNN</a>, the insanity of <a href="http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15213212">proroguing government</a>, or the insane scenes that emerge when you try to get your kids to sit down to a nutritious meal? There&#8217;s certainly plenty of crazy to talk about.</p>

<p>How about inviting 96.3 fm <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?v=info&amp;ref=search&amp;gid=5848473279">Facebook fans</a> to participate in a contest highlighting the crazy-world realities that drive us to seek out Classical music in our lives? In fact, if you look at their <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?v=wall&amp;ref=search&amp;gid=5848473279">Facebook wall</a>, this is what folks are already talking about. One writer says how Classical music forces her to do her homework, another talks about how it saves his sanity while travelling long distances in his car. It&#8217;s all right there in black and white. All they&#8217;d need to do is get people to better mine their stories, collect media and <em>shazam!</em> ready-made content to bring their tagline to life.</p>

<p>The point is that 96.3 fm&#8217;s unique spin is right there embedded in their own tagline. Take a look at your company&#8217;s tagline, it&#8217;s mantra or whatever you call it. Have you really brought it to life in it&#8217;s fullest form? What possibilities are there to engage people in a meaningful way?</p>
