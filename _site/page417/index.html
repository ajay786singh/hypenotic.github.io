        Asbestos and Ice Cream

    <p><a rel="attachment wp-att-2581" href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/2567/asbestos-and-ice-cream/attachment/nellie"><img title="Nellie" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Nellie.png" alt="" width="246" height="306" /></a></p>

<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-2581" href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/2567/asbestos-and-ice-cream/attachment/nellie"></a>Before the age of the internet&#8211;well, before  age of the television, how companies treated their employees was largely a matter between the employee and the company.</p>

<p>I recently heard a BBC radio program about a young woman named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nellie_Kershaw">Nellie Kershaw</a> who, in the 1920&#8242;s suffered the first documented case of asbestos poisoning while working at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_%26_Newall">Turner Brothers Asbestos</a> in Manchester, UK.</p>

<p>Unable to work, Nellie corresponded with Turner Brothers requesting sickness benefits, she asked:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do about my case? I have been home 9 weeks now and have not received a penny &#8211; I think it&#8217;s time that there was something from you as the National Health refuses to pay me anything. I am needing nourishment and the money, I should have had 9 weeks wages now through no fault of my own.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nellie was flat-out refused any form of compensation because asbestos poisoning was not a recognized occupational disease at that time. Nellie died in her early 30&#8242;s and was buried in an unmarked grave because when Nellie&#8217;s husband asked Turner Brothers for help in paying for funeral arrangements, they again refused to provide any form of compensation.&lt;!--more--&gt;</p>

<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-2581" href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/2567/asbestos-and-ice-cream/attachment/nellie"></a>History only remembers Nellie Kershaw because her case led to the implementation of the first asbestos industry regulations in 1931.</p>

<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-2584" href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/2567/asbestos-and-ice-cream/attachment/screen-shot-2010-07-25-at-3-00-07-pm"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2584" title="Screen shot 2010-07-25 at 3.00.07 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Screen-shot-2010-07-25-at-3.00.07-PM.png" alt="" width="305" height="402" /></a>Fast forward just shy of 100 years. <a href="http://www.chapmans.ca/">Chapman&#8217;s Ice Cream</a> factory in <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/ontario/article/691159">Markdale Ontario is destroyed by fire</a>. The factory had been in the town for 35 years. At the time of the fire Markdale had a population of 1400, and 350 of it&#8217;s residents worked at the factory.</p>

<p>Shortly after the fire, Chapman&#8217;s owners David and Penny Chapman announced that the company would pay salaried employees in full for one year, hourly employees for four months – and he would &#8220;take care of&#8221; them beyond that.</p>

<p>This decision was consistent with everything Chapman&#8217;s stood for as a company. It had long supported the community at a grassroots level&#8211;from supporting local baseball teams to donating large sums to the local hospital.</p>

<p>So I find myself staying at a cottage near Markdale nearly a year after the fire. On a ride up with a friend who has just moved from Toronto to a town near Markdale, my husband was bemoaning the poor (corporate type) ice cream available in the region.</p>

<p>Our friend staunchly defended Chapman&#8217;s  by telling the story of the fire and how Chapman&#8217;s stood up for its employees and for the town it is part of. Our friend said &#8220;you&#8217;ll never hear anyone in town say anything bad about Chapmans.&#8221;</p>

<p>I happened to take the kids for a scoop of the cold stuff  at Chilli Willi&#8217;s Ice Cream Parlour near Markdale.This particular parlour had to close its doors early when Chapman&#8217;s closure meant ice cream shortages. The owner would not carry another supplier. She decided to wait until Chapman&#8217;s was back up and running. Here, I heair a young man say how he likes the chocolate ice cream in the parlour better than the Chapman&#8217;s ice cream he gets at home. I think &#8220;this guy knows his Chapman&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not only does this story get lots of play in the local ice cream parlour and in and around Markdale, but the <a href="http://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=12&amp;ved=0CBoQFjABOAo&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fviews.washingtonpost.com%2Fleadership%2Fguestinsights%2F2010%2F02%2Fjoe-frontiera-and-dan-leidl.html&amp;ei=naVLTLKFIMP4nAf9zdjjDQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGqjP9vOdKlJTTOMHKdswvgcoYDKg&amp;sig2=ZiLpMcXfsKLU4g0cRl94hw">Washington Post </a>wrote about the case as an example of exemplary corporate social responsibility.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Against this background of cynicism about business &#8212; sometimes deserved &#8212; David and Penny Chapman stand out. After the fire, they could have called it a career, taking their insurance money and retiring to a warmer climate. Instead they did something all too rare in today&#8217;s corporate culture &#8212; they thought of others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ice cream is a feel-good product; it puts smiles on children&#8217;s faces. And Chapman&#8217;s carried that feel-good-factor forward by supporting the folks who worked hard to make Chapman&#8217;s a success.</p>

<p>People in Markdale are loyal to Chapman&#8217;s ice cream. It&#8217;s practically the only brand you&#8217;ll see in general stores in the area. And, while I&#8217;m generally resistant to &#8216;big corporate&#8217; entities like Chapman&#8217;s and the farming practices they employ, I have to say, the impact of Chapman&#8217;s gesture to employees put the sprinkles on top of their brand.</p>

<p>Chapman&#8217;s leveraged their role as a beloved Canadian organization in the following ad where they thank Canada for supporting them while they were rebuilding their plant.</p>

<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-2581" href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/2567/asbestos-and-ice-cream/attachment/nellie"></a></p>

<p>Chapman&#8217;s has leveraged its &#8220;when-bad-things-happen-to-good-people tale. But they do it without being exploitive. They have turned a tragedy into a triumph for their brand, for their employees, for the town, and finally, for Canada, who cheers on the success of the ice cream brand because it&#8217;s nice, just like we are.</p>
