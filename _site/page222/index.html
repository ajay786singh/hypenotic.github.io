</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The mental health consequence of sport-inflicted head injuries is making headlines. Hockey players like Derek Boogaard have died as a result of multiple head injuries and they have the autopsied <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/06/sports/hockey/derek-boogaard-a-brain-going-bad.html?pagewanted=1">damaged brains </a>to prove it. NFL players are launching <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/sports_nut/2011/02/the_nfls_next_big_headache.html">a class action suit</a> against the League for failing to protect them from the brain injuries they currently suffer from.</p>

<p>Similarly returning soldiers suffering from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/02/us/acting-helps-soldier-cope-with-post-traumatic-stress-disorder.html?scp=2&amp;sq=ptsd%20military&amp;st=cse">Post Traumatic Stress</a> have been the subject of much attention and governments are<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8634277.stm"> currently dedicating significant resources </a>to raise awareness so that soldiers can get the treatment they need.</p>

<p>As much as awareness about male mental illness is of great social value, the hyper-masculinization of mental illness may not do much for the majority of men who suffer for much less grandiose reasons.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an ad from UK&#8217;s leading Veteran&#8217;s Mental Health Charity, <a href="http://www.combatstress.org.uk/">Combat Stress</a> powerfully depicting PTSD.</p>

<p>I should say, I have a personal investment in promoting men&#8217;s mental health. Ten years ago my brother Tracy died in a car crash. He had spent most of his life suffering from mental illness that significantly diminished his quality of life. It wasn&#8217;t the result of hockey or war. It was more likely the cause of some bad wiring.</p>

<p>When I consider all of the progress being made in the area of male mental illness, I ask myself whether the current climate of awareness around men&#8217;s mental health would have made a difference in his life. Frankly, as much as he was a huge (huge, huge) hockey fan, I&#8217;m not convinced that depression and disorders caused by head-injuries would have relieved him of the shame he felt as a result of suffering from mental illness.</p>

<p>While the focus on male mental illness does help bring it out of the closet,  the way in which it is currently being addressed doesn&#8217;t help with the mental health issues faced by most men.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it. For most men mental illness is not a result of some grand heroic gesture. It&#8217;s not because their brains have been shaken loose or because they have witnessed horrible atrocities. It&#8217;s a much more mundane part of their daily lives which comes with a daily dose of shame.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What the mental health movement really needs is a way to address the stigma associated with the most common forms of mental illness in men. Consider the findings from <a href="http://www.mind.org.uk/help/people_groups_and_communities/mens_mental_health">a Mental Health NGO in the UK</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Depression occurs as often in men as in women, but women are twice as likely to be diagnosed and treated</li>
<li>  One in nine adult men is dependent on alcohol; men are three times more likely than women to be alcohol dependent.</li>
<li>  Men who meet a diagnosis of a personality disorder are heavily represented in the prison population</li>
</ul>

<p>It takes alot of bravery for men to stand up and say they are suffering. But maybe this bravery business is overrated.  A great campaign out of Australia taking a different tact by telling men to <a href="http://softenthefckup.com.au/">Soften the Fck Up</a>. It&#8217;s not a magic bullet solution (there&#8217;s no such thing), but it is an interesting way to think about how we can begin to address it.</p>

<p>So do men need to Soften Up, Buck Up, Stand Up, Shut Up? How do you think mainstream male mental illness should be addressed? Do you think focusing on sports celebrities and military heroes helps the issue?</p>

<p>I predict you&#8217;ll see alot more on this issue in 2012. Let&#8217;s get the conversation going.</p>
