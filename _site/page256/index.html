    Hayden plays at Foodstock

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yesterday, Jodi bought my ticket to Foodstock. It was the pay-what-you-can event to raise funds to use in efforts to stop the proposed Melancthon Mega-quarry from being built.</p>

<p>Foodstock was a whole lot more than a fundraiser though:</p>

<ul>
<li>  <span style="direction: ltr;">It was a massive display of citizens playing their role in society</span></li>
<li>  <span style="direction: ltr;">It attracted 30,000 people</span></li>
<li>  <span style="direction: ltr;">The crowd was an amazingly diverse make-up crossing culture, age, industry and political lines</span></li>
<li>  <span style="direction: ltr;">Many participants came from outside of the region–in many cases, from out of the province</span></li>
<li>  Local chefs, many of whom give their energy to several causes during the course of the year, trucked their gear through mud, rain and serious wind to set up in the forest, preparing treats for line-ups of chilled, hungry revelers in less than ideal conditions. They did it with smiles.</li>
<li>  Local musicians <a href="http://www.cufftheduke.ca/" title="Cuff the Duke">Cuff the Duke</a>, <a href="http://www.lilyfrost.com/" title="Lily Frost">Lily Frost</a>, <a href="http://mgmtrust.ca/producers/jose-contreras/">Jose Contreras</a>, <a href="http://www.jimcuddy.com/" title="Jim Cuddy">Jim Cuddy</a>, <a href="http://www.wasteyourdaysaway.com/news.html" title="Hayden">Hayden</a>, members of the <a href="http://barenakedladies.com/home" title="barenaked ladies">Barenaked Ladies</a>, <a href="http://viamusicprogram.com/who_we_are.html">Tom Barlow</a>, <a href="http://www.sarahharmer.com/">Sarah Harmer</a>, <a href="http://www.ronsexsmith.com/">Ron Sexsmith</a> and the <a href="http://www.loonchoir.com/main.html">Loon Choir</a> risked electrocution and hypothermia to electrify a crowd</li>
</ul>

<p>And the title of the post wasn&#8217;t just link-bait.</p>

<p>Like the<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/view/2011/10/07-0" title="Naomi Klein&#39;s address to Occupy Wall Street"> Occupy Wall Street</a> movement, Foodstock is part of an attempt to help people, politicians and industry envision alternatives.</p>

<p>For the last 60 years, increasingly short-term profit has been the guiding hand influencing our economy. That&#8217;s silly. Anything worth having takes time and effort.</p>

<p>Alice Walker aptly said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The most common way people <em>give up</em> their <em>power</em> is by thinking they don&#8217;t have any.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Too many people put up with the status quo because they don&#8217;t envision the alternative, and that they can have a hand in creating it.</p>

<p>In the movie &#8220;<a href="http://www.bluegold-worldwaterwars.com/" title="Blue Gold">Blue-Gold</a>&#8221; about the degree to which Water Corporations (the new Oil companies) have embedded themselves and taken over civic water supplies around the world, I learned about the uprising in Bolivia that ultimately led to the ousting of the <a class="zem_slink" title="Bechtel" href="http://www.bechtel.com" rel="homepage">Bechtel Corporation</a>.</p>

<p>Bolivians didn&#8217;t even have rights to collect rain water. They were thirsty, angry and got organized. Locals in Cochabamba, led by a young machinist revolted, resulting in new consideration for rights to water in their charter.</p>

<p>The process required  the death of a 17 year old (shot in the face), people blinded by tear gas, all manner of injuries, fear mongering and homes of organizers ransacked.</p>

<p>Ultimately however, the Bolivian Government broke a 200 million dollar contract on a public water system with foreign investors.</p>

<p>If shareholders knew that all this was required to deliver their quarterly returns, would they still want the money?</p>

<p>Maybe. But I, and the 30,000 folks who participated in Foodstock this weekend have a glass-half full mentality. We figure that awareness is a critical step in designing economies that sustain instead of exploit. Countries around the world are living the lessons of privatization of soil, water and their other most valuable resources.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s act on these lessons while our glass is indeed half full.</p>

<p>And finally, here are some pics from the event: http://hypn.tc/pGPc67</p>
