<p>Hello world,</p>

<p>My name is Dorothy and I am the intern at Hypenotic for the next few months!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m roughly two weeks in, so it&#8217;s time I introduced myself.</p>

<p>My lifelong goal is to become a missionary, perhaps in Myanmar or China or even Germany; I&#8217;m not exactly sure yet, but I know it will happen one day.<br>
My dream job would be to illustrate childrens&#8217; books.<br>
My all-time favourites are C.S. Lewis, George Balanchine, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, William Turner, rabbits, and pretzels with butter in them.</p>

<p>I am an architecture student in my final year at the University of Waterloo; <em>how strange,</em> you say? Indeed.</p>

<p>This semester, I was convinced that I didn&#8217;t want to intern at an architecture office.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m just unlucky, but my past architecture internships have consisted of working on deadline-oriented, money-busting, consumeristic, elitist architecture for fashionable clients (I hope I don&#8217;t sound bitter). This is the final co-op semester before I graduate from architecture school, so I wanted to try something that would refresh and re-inspire me about design, that good design is design with a purpose (a good purpose at that).</p>

<p>I am particularly interested in learning more about communications design because it is potentially a powerful tool in catalyzing connection between people.</p>

<p>There is something very special about graphics because it is communications in its purest form, virtually accessible to anybody &#8212; it transcends academia levels and language barriers.</p>

<p>I came across Hypenotic while googling a list of of design firms in Toronto (nothing fancy).<br>
Beyond the awesome name, Hypenotic stuck out to me, because this office is concerned with values-driven projects, projects that actually make a positive difference in the community and in daily life. I reckoned that over the next few months, I would learn several things to carry with me in the career ahead.</p>

<p>Sincerely delighted upon the happenstance of Hypenotic&#8217;s website showing up on google,</p>

<p>Dorothy.</p>
