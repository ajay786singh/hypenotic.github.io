  <p><a href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/6884/the-two-most-overrated-virtues-greatness-and-happiness/attachment/screen-shot-2011-09-29-at-3-50-29-pm" rel="attachment wp-att-6907"><img class="size-full wp-image-6907 alignleft" title="Screen shot 2011-09-29 at 3.50.29 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-shot-2011-09-29-at-3.50.29-PM.png" alt="" width="230" height="171" /></a></p>

<p>My brother always wanted an electric guitar. He beeegggged my parents for one. He never got one most likely because they thought it&#8217;d be too annoying to listen to and because they couldn&#8217;t really be bothered.</p>

<p>Today if a kid expressed an interest in guitar (and the parents had the means) that kid would have a shiny electric guitar and amp faster than you could say &#8220;Getty Lee.&#8221; Not only that, but that kid would be registered for guitar lessons, guitar camp and invited to join in family sing-a-longs where dad would learn all the words to <a href="http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/baba-o&#x27;riley-lyrics-the-who/75e7055d463e94e648256977002ee262">Baba O&#8217;Riley.</a></p>

<p>Modern parents believe that having a talent is a good thing. It&#8217;s not only personally fulfilling for kids but cultivates a kind of discipline that&#8211;whether they become rock stars or not&#8211;will serve them well throughout their lives.</p>

<p>There has been a shift in thinking away from blind faith in natural talent to a belief that *practice, practice, practice * makes all the difference.</p>

<p>This notion was validated by Malcolm Gladwell who, in his book Outliers, found that it takes 10,000 hours of hard work to become an expert in a given field. But this is something parenting experts had been saying for years: that parents need to praise hard work over natural talent&#8211;since talent can be transformed through effort:</p>

<p>As<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-13128701"> one expert</a> put it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Intelligence-based praise orients the receiver towards the fixed mindset &#8211; it suggests to them that intelligence is of primary importance rather than the effort through which intelligence can be transformed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But let&#8217;s pause for a moment and ask why we&#8217;re so doggedly determined to make sure our children unlock their full potential? I believe because it&#8217;s based on the basic assumption that people who have realized their full potential are happier. And we all want happier children. But is this basic assumption actually true?</p>

<p>Nowhere in Outliers does Malcolm Gladwell say that* any* of the people he profiles, from Bill Gates to Paul McCartney, are any happier than the far less accomplished computer geeks and musicians that populate the planet. Sure they have achieved fame and fortune, but so what?</p>

<p>You might be surprised to know that it&#8217;s happiness that breeds success, and not the other way around.<a href="http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/bul-1316803.pdf"> According to Sonja Lyubomirsky, Ph.D. at the University of California</a>&#8220;Positive emotions produce the tendency to approach rather than to avoid and to prepare the individual to seek out and undertake new goals.&#8221; Lybomirsky refers to these types as &#8220;chronically happy&#8221;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although little is known at present about the genetic pre- dispositions characterizing chronically happy individuals, we can- not discount the possibility that long-term happiness may be directly linked—perhaps through inborn correlates—with particular desirable outcomes or characteristics</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, just to recap what all this research tells us:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Talent isn&#8217;t inborn, but is the product of hard work</li>
<li>  Hard work is the result of a happy disposition</li>
<li>  A happy disposition is possibly inborn</li>
<li>  Therefore, naturally happy people are predisposed to being talented</li>
</ul>

  So folks, if you&#8217;re got yourself a grumpy Greta or surly Steve, cancel those violin classes and save your money for therapy.
</div>

<div>
  Or, take my advice: mediocrity is an underrated virtue. Try to raise kids that are chronically mediocre and they&#8217;ll get along just fine.
