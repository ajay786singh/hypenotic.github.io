<p>To Head of Big Movie Studio,</p>

<p>Recently you&#8217;ve been doing alot (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lE9-W9JNjio&amp;feature=player_embedded#at=25">like making this ad</a>) to help me see that pirating films is wrong because it&#8217;s like stealing from the artists who worked so hard to made those movies. So, when I went to license a film for a fundraiser for my daughter&#8217;s nursery school, I made sure I went through all the proper channels like paying $350 to show <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0451079/">Horton Hears a Who</a> to kids under 5 and their folks.</p>

<p>When you took $350 from a nursery school, it would have been really, really helpful if you would have told me what happens to the money. Because, when you told me that I could go rent the film to show it to the kids, I felt a little bit ripped off.  Like for $350 you couldn&#8217;t mail me the film?</p>

<p>So then you mailed the movie to me. I searched the whole invoice envelope and there was nothing in there about where the money went. No pictures of the nice editors and stunt men who worked so hard to make the movie and deserved to be paid. Instead I received a whole long note telling me I had to pay to return the film, and another note all in caps (CAPS!!!) that said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010</p>

<p>THERE WILL BE  $2.00 PER DAY PER VIDEO/DVD LATE FEE FOR ALL MOVIES</p>

<p>IN ADDITION CUSTOMERS MAY BE CHARGED FOR ANY LOST OR DAMAGED VIDEOS/DVDS</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I just want you to know that when you write in ALL CAPS I start to feel very bad inside. I start to feel that you&#8217;re not very nice to me when all I&#8217;m trying to do is raise a little money for some kids and support some artists along the way.  I suggest next time you tuck a little note in with the invoice that makes me feel good about what I&#8217;m doing.</p>

<p>P.S. If you were nicer, maybe less people would want to steal your stuff.</p>

<p>P.P.S. For some way better Anti-piracy ads check out this one from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LkWKvMCzqA&amp;feature=related">Jack Black</a> and this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUhibKNxICM&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=FD6141D21E1658CF&amp;playnext=1&amp;playnext_from=PL&amp;index=8">killer ad from the UK</a></p>

<p>Yours truly,</p>

<p>Jodi (Pippa and Jayne&#8217;s Mom) and social coordinator <a href="http://myschoolcooperative.org/">My School Cooperative Nursery </a></p>
