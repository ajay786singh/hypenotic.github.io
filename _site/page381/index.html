        The Blessing of a Lost Makeup Bag

    <span class="post-date">16 Oct 2010</span>

    <p><a rel="attachment wp-att-3569" href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/3567/the-blessing-of-a-lost-makeup-bag/attachment/screen-shot-2010-10-16-at-8-55-58-pm"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3569" title="Screen shot 2010-10-16 at 8.55.58 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-16-at-8.55.58-PM.png" alt="" width="316" height="325" /></a>It was the perfect storm. First the fixture in our bathroom broke and we were down to one bulb making it hard to see my skin up close. Then, I lost my makeup bag&#8211;just one of the hazards of lugging it back and forth from my spinning class.</p>

<p>So, I went a week without makeup or hair product. I apologize if you were one of the people who saw me during that week-long period. I wasn&#8217;t looking my best.</p>

<p>Truth is I couldn&#8217;t live without my <a href="http://www.kynk.ca/product/HH110">Kynk  Hair Honey</a>, a fabulous all natural product that doesn&#8217;t irritate my already super sensitive scalp with alcohol. I&#8217;ve only ever seen Hair Honey at <a href="http://www.thebigcarrot.ca/">The Big Carrot</a>, so off I went to replace it.</p>

<p>And,  while at The Big Carrot, with my hubby and kids waiting in the car, I made the monumental, spontaneous decision to shift to all chemical free cosmetics. In addition to the Hair Honey, I  bought two things:</p>

<ol>
<li> <a href="http://www.earthlab.ca/products/natural_mascara.html">Earthlab Cosmetics Raw Mascara </a>and</li>
<li> <a href="http://www.100percentpure.com/PINK-GRAPEFRUIT-GLOW-LIP-CHEEK-TINT-s/70.htm">100 Percent Pure Pink Grapefruit Glow for Lips and Cheeks</a></li>
</ol>

<p>I&#8217;m now determined to whittle my formerly overstuffed makeup bag down to 5 items max (blush, mascara, lipstick, tinted moisturizer and eyeliner).  And, I want all of those things to be friendly to my body and to the earth. As the saying goes &#8220;what goes on goes in&#8221; and I want what goes in to not mess with my health.</p>

<p>This is a radical step for me. The last remaining &#8220;conventional&#8221; makeup item in my possession is my <a href="http://www.dermalogica.com/ca/html/products/sheer-moisture-spf15-18.html?type=&amp;cat=">Dermalogica Sheer Tint Moisture</a>&#8211;salvaged by the fact that it had fallen out of my makeup bag before I schlepped it to the gym that fateful day. A little peak at <a href="http://www.cosmeticsdatabase.com/">The Environmental Working Group&#8217;s Skin Deep database </a>revealed that my trusted Moisturizer is <a href="http://www.cosmeticsdatabase.com/product/278663/Dermalogica_Sheer_Tint_Moisture_SPF_15_Dark/">rated a 3 out of 10</a> on their hazard scale&#8211;a moderate hazard.</p>

<p>Moderate hazard? Is it worth the risk?</p>

<p>I grew up with a mom who had a vanity table with a big mirror with lights all around it. I felt totally glamorous looking in that mirror. I think I probably spent hours staring at my reflection.  And the drawers of that Hollywood vanity table were full of neatly organized fancy makeup containers that were incredibly alluring to me&#8211;even at an early age.</p>

<p>My &#8216;bubby&#8217; (Jewish grandmother) was proud to declare that she never left home without her makeup. I&#8217;ve always kinda been the same. People don&#8217;t think of me as the &#8220;makeup type&#8221; because the makeup itself is barely detectable on my face. It&#8217;s more the gesture, the idea of makeup I guess that makes me feel &#8220;put together.&#8221;<br>
But, I promise, I&#8217;m always wearing mascara and tinted moisturizer if not more.</p>

<p>That is until I lost my makeup bag.</p>

<p>So, giving  up conventional makeup isn&#8217;t easy for me. There&#8217;s quite a bit of marketing baggage that has helped convince me that the familiar store-bought makeup is fun and makes me look pretty. In fact, when I got into the car today and unwrapped my new cheek and lip glow, eager to try it on for size, my husband (with whom I have 2 daughters) said &#8220;Just like one of the girls.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he was right. But this time there was a difference. I finally decided to infuse my enjoyment of cosmetics with my own personal values. I&#8217;m venturing to say that it won&#8217;t  make me enjoy it less, or feel less pampered, pretty, etc. In fact, I&#8217;m already looking forward to my next trip to The Big Carrot for some tinted moisturizer and an eyeliner.</p>

<p>If you see me around, tell me what you think.</p>
