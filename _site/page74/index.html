<p>It seems like I&#8217;ve been reading <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/a-list-apart-relaunches-new-features-new-design" title="A lIst Apart">A List Apart forever</a>. In case you don&#8217;t now it, it&#8217;s been the journal of a team called Happy Cog who&#8217;ve been inventing the web since the web went mainstream.</p>

<p>Beyond informative, engaging and timely  content,  reading it has always been a pleasure. A List Apart has always taken the user experience into account and it showed.</p>

<p>They just launched a significant over-haul, with all of the care for craft you&#8217;d expect, but I think the most instructive lessons from the launch are less about the design and more about the process.</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lessons are marked in red.  </span></p>

<p>It took them 14 months (<span style="color: #ff0000;">1. </span>What&#8217;s the rush, exactly?<span style="color: #ff0000;"> 2. </span>Slow cooking is always richer)</p>

<p>They brought in several of their top guns past and present (<span style="color: #ff0000;">3. </span>It takes familiarity with subject matter and passionate talent to make something noteworthy, let alone iconic)</p>

<p>They launch with a disclaimer letting faithful readers and newbies know:</p>

<ul>
<li>  If you find an obvious bug or UX flaw, they&#8217;re probably working on it (<span style="color: #ff0000;">4. </span>Bugs are natural. <span style="color: #ff0000;">5. </span>Imperfections are inevitable, embrace it–or at least get over it)</li>
<li>  There&#8217;s more to come, but new features will be launched when they&#8217;re ready (<span style="color: #ff0000;">6. </span>The site is a living thing, and will grow naturally)</li>
<li>  It&#8217;s yours, please let us know how it can be fixed/improved/evolved (<span style="color: #ff0000;">7. </span>Your feedback is a driver in this endeavour)</li>
</ul>

<p>At the time I wrote this, there were 76 comments, many of them readers noting bugs or making recommendations ranging from accessibility considerations (tweaks to be compliant) to UI questions (hyper-link colours), etc.</p>

<p>Notably, many of the comments are from the design/dev team, responding to the feedback, including letting readers know when bugs have been squashed. (<span style="color: #ff0000;">8. </span>Getting free, timely insight into how you can improve is a research coup. <span style="color: #ff0000;">9. </span>You score off the charts goodwill by responding to comments right away, and approval rates go stratospheric when you respond by actually fixing the &#8216;problems&#8217; <span style="color: #ff0000;">10. </span>Even if you&#8217;re not commenting on the bugs, it&#8217;s heartening to see such a thriving community)</p>

<p>Most of this is common sense, if not common courtesy. It&#8217;s all worth noting because even though we know it, most organizations don&#8217;t do it. The web, for many, is still a burden. An afterthought. A nice to do when you can get to it. And when people do focus on it, they focus on the wrong things. Instead of arbitrary launch dates, why not focus on when the product will have value? Instead of getting every bug squashed, why not engage your audience in a dialogue about the content and experience they care about?</p>

<p>These are bold, scary ideas. Just the kind to separate the leaders from the followers.</p>
