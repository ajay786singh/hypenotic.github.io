        <h1>We stopped dreaming</h1>
        <p class="meta"><span class="sub-meta">By</span>  <span class="sub-meta">in</span> category</p>
        <p>Came across this video containing a series of ideas by superstar astrophysicist Neil Degrasse Tyson and I was inspired.</p>

<p>I bought the historical narrative that NASA&#8217;s drive to the moon was predicated on tactical positioning–higher ground in the US/Russian arms race, right away. And I also accepted that whatever the driver, dreaming about the unknown created an era in which imagination knew no bounds. People were inspired to become scientists because it was the path to the unknown.</p>

<p>I was struck by how many people were white in the video, but I know there are several reasons for that. The thing that nagged at me was Gil Scott-Heron&#8217;s poem from that era, &#8220;Whitey on the Moon&#8221;, which points out how absurd it seems to be sending people into space when we have problems we need to address right here.</p>

<p>I ran the Tyson video by Jodi and she felt the same way, more strongly. We netted our discussion out at the idea that it would be neat if there was a NASA for Earth. An organization funded to imagine and address our most insurmountable issues.</p>

<p>But here&#8217;s the thing. The person who uploaded the Whitey on the Moon to Youtube in 2008 left this comment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A humorous little poem by the great Gil Scott-Heron. Lets see if president Obama will reorganize and re-prioritize the spending of taxpayers dollars. Will food, Shelter and Other social issues take precedence over the military industrial complex and Moon Rocks.<br>
We Shall See!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And it changed my mind. Here&#8217;s why:</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve been working with an amazing social justice agency called PARC for a little while now. They&#8217;re Parkdale&#8217;s (the neighbourhood Hypenotic is in) largest employer, and they offer food, shelter, and a range of other services to a community of members who have been systematically marginalized for many years.</p>

<p>The main reason PARC is awesome is that they&#8217;ve realized that though food and shelter are critical to survival, survival is a pretty low bar. Imagine your motivation for waking up and getting going each day was survival, instead of inspiration, passion, connection, faith, responsibility, etc? How long could you do it? Isn&#8217;t it security, support, friends, hobbies, meaningful work, etc that make life worth living?</p>

<p>PARC offers a range of services, approaches and programs that treat members as people, not conditions. They have a weekly music jam with some serious (and seriously passionate) musicians. A reading series, sports (like hockey), etc. Activities that help people with conditions that we all suffer from to some degree (mental illness, addiction, poverty) transcend their circumstances through moments that make us feel alive.</p>

<p>SO, the pendulum came back for me. Yes, we need to spend more money addressing issues that divide us based on our circumstances. But I&#8217;m thinking to do that, we might need to do a bit of big dreaming again.</p>
