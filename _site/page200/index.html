<p>Two or three times a week during lunchtime I go to yoga at a studio near my office. I have discovered that these days I come back to my computer feeling happier, refreshed and more motivated to be productive.</p>

<p>It is very hard to spend 8 straight hours producing work every day. And while not everyone may be able to take time in the middle of the day to workout, there are simple things you can do to help improve your experience in the workplace. Here are 4 things I learned from going to yoga and that I try to apply every day.</p>

<p><strong>1. Change environment.</strong><br>
Just to get out of the office is already a triumph. Try to schedule time outside to have some fresh air, walk around the block, or get a coffee or lunch somewhere new. I find that most of the time, stepping out brings new perspectives and inspiration to solve a problem faster than when I just stay inside . Getting out of the office for a while is well-invested time.</p>

<p><strong>2. Breathe.</strong><br>
When was the last time you took one conscious breath? Lets try it now, one deep breath. Ready? Ok, start by inhaling slowly through your nose, feel all the air filling your lungs and expanding your diaphragm, hold for a second, now exhale as you try to empty all the air and let go of some of the tension in your shoulders. Feels good doesn’t it? Try it again. Like meditation, yoga helps to shift your focus from the constant dialogue happening in your head to what’s actually happening in your body through conscious breathing. After all, breathing correctly means getting more oxygen to your blood stream and oxygen gets you high (doesn’t it?).</p>

<p><strong>3. Move your body.</strong><br>
Think about how many hours have you been sitting down. Stand up, stretch your legs, put your arms up to liberate some of the tension in your column. Move your neck gently in circles a couple of times to each side. Do circles with all your joints: wrists, knees, ankles, and elbows. If you think it is awkward to do this in front of your coworkers go back to point number 1 and step out of the office to walk and stretch.</p>

<p><strong>4. Listen to your body.</strong><br>
Sometimes I find myself sitting in very uncomfortable postures and only realize it once it starts hurting. Make a quick posture check once every hour or so bringing consciousnesses back to your body. Are you shrugging your shoulders? Are you carrying more weight on one side of your body? Try to distribute your weight equally on your sitting bones, try unclenching the jaw and relax your face.</p>

<p>Yoga, as well as these simple exercises, tries to balance the attention between mind and body. Most of the time we give priority to the mind because it is the most practical tool we have to solve problems, especially at work. However the body thinks too, its thoughts are made of conscious movement and breath. Imagine what we could accomplish both inside and outside the workplace if we learn to think using our mind and body as a whole.</p>
