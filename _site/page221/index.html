        Ontario Lakes Project: Bass Lake
      </a>

    <span class="post-date">05 Jan 2012</span>

    <p><a href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8076/ontario-lakes-project-bass-lake/attachment/bass" rel="attachment wp-att-8085"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8085" title="bass" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/bass-580x347.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="347" /></a></p>

<p>While searching out content for this week&#8217;s Ontario Lake, I stumbled on this sweet &amp; charming video of a family picking apples at Bass Lake. But that&#8217;s just where the story begins&#8230;.</p>

<p>The video features a woman named Ada Grexton and was posted by Jason Merling. I reached out to Jason on Facebook and Twitter and finally got his number through a mutual Facebook friend. What a world we live in where I can get the phone number of someone I only know through YouTube.</p>

<p>The Lake featured in the video is not actually called Bass Lake, it&#8217;s called Lake Aberdine, but folks who live around the lake named it for the amount of Bass you find there.It&#8217;s just south of Sault Ste. Marie.</p>

<p>Truth be told, it&#8217;s not the Bass Lake we intended to write about, but finding Jason and hearing his story made this the Bass Lake worth writing about.</p>

<p>The property was cleared (and therefore owned) by Jason&#8217;s great grandparents and became a family compound. It was a farm with many apple trees like the ones you see in the video. Today, all of the Apple Trees are gone, having succumbed to disease over the years.</p>

<p>But much of the property&#8217;s charm has been preserved. To this day there is no power or electricity on the property. Jason&#8217;s grandfather was an early &#8220;back to the land&#8221; thinker, and he would have wanted it that way. Another way the family acknowledges the significance of the property is by having a family reunion on the compound every July 1st. The highlight of the reunion is the &#8220;walk&#8221;&#8211;a 3-4 mile walk between the compound and the town of Leeburn. Some years as many as 100 family members take the walk that was taken by Ada Grexton featured n the video.</p>

<p>Special thanks to Jason Merling for taking the time to talk about Bass Lake.</p>
