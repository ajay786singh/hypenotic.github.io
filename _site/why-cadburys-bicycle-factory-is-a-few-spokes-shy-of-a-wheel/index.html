</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I stumbled upon Cadbury&#8217;s <a href="http://www.thebicyclefactory.ca/">Bicycle Factory</a> site when I noticed a couple of friends (who I like and trust) had &#8216;liked&#8217; it on Facebook. Cadbury has been on the do-good bandwagon since 2009 when  <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/food-and-wine/cadbury-dips-into-fair-trade-market/article1264256/">they proclaimed themselves </a>the world&#8217;s largest candy company to sell Fair Trade chocolate. This is the same year that the Bicycle Factory project began. The Bicycle Factory experience goes like this:</p>

<ol>
<li> Click on one of any number of Cadbury products</li>
<li> Drag it through a portal</li>
<li> Visit each day until you&#8217;ve built a bike (you can only do it 5 times per day)</li>
<li> Build a bicycle for someone in Ghana or in their words &#8220;release it to Africa&#8221;</li>
</ol>

<p>The necessary act of coming into virtual contact with a Cadbury product (like Halls, Trident Gum, Sour Peaches or Caramilk Bar) in order to help someone get a bike has &#8220;ick factor&#8221; all over it. It seemed to me that Cadbury had missed a critical opportunity to do something good without acting as a shill.</p>

<p>A little research quickly took me to the root of the problem. The <a href="http://thehiveinc.com/work/cadbury/bicycle-factory">Toronto agency who created the site in 2009 </a>describes their work in the following manner:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The days of consumers caring about contests to win a car or a trip are over. These sorts of promotions are everywhere without saying anything about the sponsoring brand. The Bicycle Factory was designed to break through this sea of sameness and give consumers a cause they could relate to and rally behind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In an attempt to &#8220;break through the sea of sameness&#8221; Cadbury has done much worse. They have taken the contest model and applied it to their corporate philanthropy efforts. To take this apart a bit, I&#8217;d like to explore why philanthropy is not like a contest.</p>

<ul>
<li>  <strong>Reason #1: The issues are more complex and sensitive: </strong>The &#8216;gaming&#8217; aspect of this promotion creates the sense that Cadbury is making light of very serious issues. Getting kids an education in Ghana is an amazing issue. But, a button that reads &#8220;release to Africa&#8221; makes light of the effort and makes me question whether Cadbury is up for the job. It also has a really bad colonial undertone. Is it just me? First of all Africa is a continent. It&#8217;s kind of a big place to release a bike to. This is about Ghana. So why not make the action about Ghana. Something like &#8220;A Ride to School&#8221; or &#8220;Send a Bike to Ghana&#8221; would be so much better.</li>
<li>  *<em>Reason #2: Take yourself out of the picture: *</em>In a contest or simple promotion you can ask people to come into contact with your products. Sure, cut out the UPC code and send it in. Ask me to go online and show proof of purchase. But if you&#8217;re going to show me you care, don&#8217;t make me touch your products&#8211;gum and sour peaches&#8211;even virtually. It feels really bad. If you act as a leader you gain far more credibility than by reminding me that this is all about brand promotion.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#8217;m not saying that a company like Cadbury can&#8217;t do good by engaging their customers in something valuable like sending bikes to Ghana. In fact, I think it&#8217;s a great initiative at its core. But Cadbury needs to be a leader in engaging people on a deeper level than a promotions/contest approach can possibly encompass.</p>
