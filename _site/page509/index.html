<p>I&#8217;ve been working on a handmade gift this season for my brother-in-law, who&#8217;s also a designer. Tough to create something for a another creator. I felt under a lot of pressure to represent.</p>

<p>What was nice about working on this project was the feeling of being an artist again. Many commercial designers spend a lot of time at their desks and not at a table with glue and scissors. It was great to get my hands dirty and feel a real sense of accomplishment once it was all done [although the clean-up was a bitch; it&#39;s certainly easier to shut down your computer than wipe away glue and sawdust from every surface in your kitchen]. </p>

<p>I had been dreading creating this gift, and the idea only came to me a few days ago, which didn&#8217;t leave me a lot of time to execute. Had I given myself more time, the project would have come out that much better [although it&#39;s still pretty nice as is]. But once I got started, the feeling of making something by hand for a loved one was very satisfying, and I kept thinking that I was much happier covered in glue and paper in my socks than trapped in a mall spending too much money and energy. Plus I garnered a lot of inspiration for future work, for both 2d and 3d projects, which was a nice side-effect. </p>

<p>I also hand-assembled Hypenotic&#8217;s holiday client treats, which surrounded my desk with cut paper, raffia, freshly-designed labels, etc. Being so out of the loop from the handmade business [I used to self-produce greeting cards], it took a lot longer than I expected, but it turned out to be great fun, and again, very fulfilling. Nice to make something for someone that has some true love in it.</p>

<p>These harsher financial times have forced us to get back to basics. Craft and handmade-goods businesses are seeing a boom this holiday season as people move away from mindless spending and toward true inspiration. We go through so many days wondering how we got by without our machines and when the internet goes down for whatever reason, we feel helpless and useless. Time to get over that and force ourselves to use our brains and our hands.</p>

<p>So get out and get dirty. Make something. Anything. For you. For someone else. You&#8217;ll be surprised at how well it pays off.</p>
