  <p>Hugh at Cluetrain wrote a cool summary of the history of brand influence. The point being that the newest model, which he calls &#8220;expressive capital&#8221;, is manifest in brands taking the &#8220;Love Mark&#8221; to a new level by allowing people to believe something about themselves–to bring context to their beliefs.</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li> <strong>First we had Human Capital.</strong> You There Go to the next village and kill everybody because I&#8217;m the Chief of this village and I say so etc.</li>
<li> <strong>Then came Physical Capital.</strong> Land, property, factories etc.</li>
<li> <strong>Then came Financial Capital.</strong> Money, credit, dollars etc.</li>
<li> *<em>Then came Intellectual Capital. *</em>Our widgets are better than your widgets because our engineers are smarter than your engineers etc.</li>
<li> <strong>Then came Emotional Capital.</strong> People love our product more than they love our competitor&#8217;s product etc. This is the space &#8220;Love Marks&#8221; plays around with so successfully: &#8220;A Love Mark is a brand that is loved by its user beyond reason&#8221; etc.</li>
<li> <em>**Expressive Capital.</em>* Our products make it easier for the end user to find and/or express meaning, narrative, metaphor, purpose, explanation and relevance in his/her own life than our competitor&#8217;s products.*</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s a bit like Seth Godin&#8217;s riff in &#8220;All Marketers are Liars&#8221;, where he suggests that it&#8217;s the marketer&#8217;s job to frame the offer/experience along lines that sync with consumers&#8217; hard-coded &#8220;world views&#8221;.</p>

<p>It got me thinking that neither idea goes far enough for today&#8217;s consumer climate. Instead of simply helping people believe something, find or express meaning/purpose, why not help them DO something? I mean partner with their customers to shift the needle on some point?</p>

<p>I guess the version of  &#8220;Social Marketing&#8221; that helps corporations leverage their Philanthropy strategically touches in this area –CIBC&#8217;s &#8220;Run for the Cure&#8221;, Ronald McDonald House and</p>

<p>Timberland&#8217;s &#8220;City Year&#8221; are successful examples of this. But making sure you don&#8217;t come off as capitalizing on the cause must be a tough line to tow. And even in these examples, how many people remember which non-profits are the beneficiaries?</p>

<p>Social media is a boon to marketers who want to pay attention to what their prospects deem worthy of espressing publicly. And of course it&#8217;s an unheralded opportunity for nimble organizations who &#8220;get it&#8221; to enage directly with their buying public for feedback on successes, failures and opportunities. But wouldn&#8217;t it be cool to find out about a brand who was using social media to partner with their public–as citizens in a community of interest, to fix something they felt was broken?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to investigate instances where a brand is teeming up with the public to change the world.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;e being done. Patagonia, or Trek– someone who emplys people that enjoy the outdoors (and partake) must be protecting some geographic region or something.</p>
