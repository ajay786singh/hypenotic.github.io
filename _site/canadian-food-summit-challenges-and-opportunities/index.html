  <h1 class="post-title">Canadian Food Summit Challenges and Opportunities</h1>
  <span class="post-date">15 Dec 2012</span>
  <span class="post-author"></span>
  <p>I spent the middle of a week last February at the &#8220;Canadian Food Summit&#8221; with about 600 participants (anecdotally) made up of 75% food sector business interests and 25% food sector social interest groups.</p>

<p>The event was billed as a forum for discussion about a &#8216;Canadian food strategy&#8217;, including perceived next steps. Many interesting points were made, but the initiative could benefit from the following considerations:</p>

<h2>3 Challenges</h2>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">
  <span style="color: #800000;">1. The name</span>
</h3>

<p>The event didn&#8217;t represent anyone&#8217;s idea of a cross-section of Canadians.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t about &#8216;Food&#8217;, it was about a type of food business.</p>

<p>And it certainly wasn&#8217;t a summit. I looked it up. Every definition alludes to &#8216;a meeting of leaders&#8217;. This event was long on presentations, short on discussion, and ALMOST entirely led by a limited slice of the food interest pie.</p>

<p>It could have been more appropriately called the &#8220;Food <em>Business</em> Summit&#8221;.</p>

<p>The Conference board of Canada should know better. It&#8217;s not a far leap to go from recognizing the poor name of this summit to considering the credibility of it&#8217;s forum, the &#8216;Conference Board of Canada&#8217; itself. Who are they? How do they represent Canadians? I didn&#8217;t vote for them. I&#8217;m Canadian. Can I have my country&#8217;s name back? What&#8217;s it take to get a vanity plate like that anyway, lots of money? Will they just hand them out to anyone?</p>

<p>Or is this grandiose naming business a rhetorical device I&#8217;m just late to the game on? Well it&#8217;s worth mentioning that I WILL consider their application for membership when I start the &#8216;Conference Board of the UNIVERSE&#8217; (brand style guide will guarantee use of upper-case so we all recognize that it officially super-cedes theirs) and kick off the &#8216;Milky Way Galaxy Food Strategy Summit&#8217;. The table will be a big one, representing many interests, but one goal–healthy, accessible food for all, sourced sustainably.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">
  <span style="color: #800000;">2. The approach</span>
</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>We can&#8217;t solve problems by using the same thinking we used when we created them</p>

<p>~ Albert Einstein</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Framing the problem in a way that uniquely positions your enterprise (and peers) as the solution is the kind of approach that makes an actual food strategy necessary. It&#8217;s a free market approach that excludes people with critical perspectives and expertise who belong at a table about feeding people. We need Health, Sustainability and Food Security experts as well as industry voices for any process that genuinely wants to use the words &#8216;Food&#8217; and &#8216;Strategy&#8217; in it&#8217;s title.</p>

<p>Galen Weston&#8217;s opening presentation used rhetorical devices that start the conversation in the wrong place. A growing population and a need to support big business are a false dichotomy. White bread may be profitable, but it won&#8217;t address hunger in any sustainable way. And generating profit through empty-calorie fare marketed to ignorant, harried adults and vulnerable children externalizes their costs to our health car system, health and culture–anyone know how to cook any more?</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">
  <span style="color: #800000;">3. The goal</span>
</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;A problem well stated is a problem half solved&#8221;</p>

<p>~ Charles F. Kettering</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The western world is delicately weathering a financial crisis rooted in irresponsible instruments and practices that take people out of the equation. What got us here won&#8217;t get us where we need to go.</p>

<div>
  Maple Leaf Foods President and CEO Michael McCain&#8217;s brand of Kool-aid  suggested that strong corporations and more hot dogs would solve our problems. He came off like a Simpson&#8217;s character. A trope. He said what we expected him to say, which was oddly comforting.
</div>

<p>Galen&#8217;s presentation was more dangerous because he seems to have made a genuine effort to pull the wool over our eyes. He discussed the benefits to Canadians of economic strategies like cornering markets on specific products to make us more resilient. The discussions were red herrings.</p>

<p>They ARE good strategies, if your goal is a healthy bottom line. Less so if your goal is healthy waistlines.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Opportunities</h2>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">
  <span style="color: #800000;">Partnership</span>
</h3>

<p>Environmental, health, food sector and hunger advocates can agree on one thing; things aren&#8217;t going to change overnight. Most of the dynamic leaders and change agents I know are pragmatists seeking incremental change, so why not work with them? The halo effect might obscure some of the (expected but still icky) murky, shadowy grabbiness the current approach is conveying.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">
  <span style="color: #800000;">Reform</span>
</h3>

<p>There&#8217;s a &#8216;big tent&#8217; approach to food system reform that sees a role for all. Even organizations who&#8217;s current model is predicated on margins at the expense of others (through externalities that show up on public balance sheets like health-care and the environment) can play a part. As long as they&#8217;re open to shifting their role.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">
  <span style="color: #800000;">Brand strategy</span>
</h3>

<p>Seriously. Imagine the few companies that control most of what ends up on grocery store shelves in Canada took a genuine interest in addressing nutrition, food security (access to good food) and the environment.</p>

<p>Sure they&#8217;d have to give up a boat-load in easier money by selling less crap, but that could be more than off-set in marketing cost savings–EVERYONE would be on their side. We&#8217;d do the selling for them.</p>

<p>I know this is a different business model, but there&#8217;s something enticing about the challenge isn&#8217;t there?</p>
