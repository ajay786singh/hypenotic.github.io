  <h1 class="post-title">Irish Authenticity at The Ceili Cottage</h1>
  <span class="post-date">03 Nov 2009</span>
  <span class="post-author"></span>
  <p>I&#8217;m not a food critic and this is not a restaurant review.  This is about what happens when autheticity matters.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ceilicottage.com/">The Ceili Cottage</a> is a cozy Irish Pub in Toronto&#8217;s Leslieville neigbourhood. In a town known for a string of pubs Irish in name only, The Ceili Cottage strives to deliver a remarkable experience. But, the experience is all in the details.</p>

<p>First off, if you needed evidence of Patrick and his wife Alison&#8217;s commitment to all things Irish and Local, the fact that they are providing <a href="http://www.gilchristirishdance.com/">The Gilchrist-Canavan School of Irish Dance</a> space behind the cottage should be all the proof you need. The additional I<a href="http://www.ceilicottage.com/events.htm">rish music lessons and a Shucker Club </a>ought to knock your cynicism out cold.</p>

<p>Beyond this, there are tartan blankets distributed when it&#8217;s chilly on the patio, a fine array of Irish beers on tap, pickled eggs on the menu, and oyster shells literally built into the patio floor. Their menu offers a roast dinner on Monday, and then transforms the remaining meat throughout the week (curried on Thursday, broth on Sunday).</p>

<p>What is most interesting about Ceili Cottage are the responses it&#8217;s generated. A positive review on <a href="http://www.martiniboys.com/Toronto/The-Ceili-Cottage-nightlife.html">Martini Boys</a> generated 24 comments. A negative review on <a href="http://www.blogto.com/restaurants/ceili-cottage">Blog T.O</a> resulted in 84 comments. Given Groundswell&#8217;s 10/9/90 rule these are pretty impressive stats.&lt;!--more--&gt;</p>

<p>These comments seem to fall into 2 camps:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Disappointed Downers: Seem overjoyed that Ceili&#8217;s cottage has fallen short in terms of service or food</li>
<li>  Loving Loyalists: Rush to support Ceili&#8217;s Cottage despite whatever shortcomings one may encounter</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the basic Vegetarian Conundrum. Take a stand (&#8220;I&#8217;m a vegetarian&#8221;) and many will do whatever it takes yank you off your pedestal (&#8220;what about leather, you wear leather right?).</p>

<p><a href="http://caplanskys.com/">Caplansky&#8217;s</a> ran into the same issue. They claimed to be an authentic Jewish deli. 1/2 the world will loved them even though they (sometimes) run out of smoked meat. The others, bash them at every opportunity.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s a brand to do? Both The Ceili Cottage and Caplansky&#8217;s offer some hints at how to maintain authenticity, support the loyalists and quiet the nay sayers:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Be Part of the Conversation: Both Zane Caplansky and Patrick McMurray blog, Tweet and respond to comments.</li>
<li>  Keep Calm and Carry On: Respond to the naysayers with measured calmness. Never lose your cool. Patrick begins his response to some scathing comments on BlogTO with &#8220;Thanks for all of the comments, and the review. All is fair.&#8221; How can you hate a guy like that?</li>
<li>  Thank the Fans: For his final restaurant review, the Toronto Star&#8217;s Corey Mintz wrote a <a href="http://www.thestar.com/living/restaurants/article/706467--birthing-pains-last-a-month-at-caplansky-s">glowing review of Caplansky&#8217;s </a> and Zane, in turn made a point of thanking <a href="http://blog.caplanskys.com/2009/10/11/we-smoked-em/">Corey in his blog</a></li>
<li>  Don&#8217;t get distracted. The naysayers will always be there whenever you try to do/be something special. But remember, no one bothered to comment on The Pickle Barrel&#8217;s smoked meat or the Irish Stew at the <a href="http://www.firkinpubs.com/">Fox and the Firkin</a></li>
</ul>
