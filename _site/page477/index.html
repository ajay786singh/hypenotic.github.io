    <span class="post-date">27 Oct 2009</span>

    <p>I recently treated myself to a facial. It is not something I do often because the cost/benefit equation doesn&#8217;t generally make sense to me. In other words, it&#8217;s expensive and I don&#8217;t fool myself into believing that it will produce long-term, radical benefits to my skin.</p>

<p>I suspended rational judgment to engage in an experience that would be pleasurable, relaxing and uplifting. In his book<a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Making-Meaning-Successful-Businesses-Experiences/dp/0321374096/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1256667059&amp;sr=8-1"> Making Meaning</a> Nathan Shedroff describes <a href="http://www.makingmeaning.org/meanings.html">15 core values</a> that, leveraged strategically, create meaningful customer experiences. This is a phenomenon Shedroff calls &#8220;meaningful consumption&#8221;  as opposed to &#8220;simply responding based on features, price, brand identity and emotional pitches.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, how does this work? The spa experience falls under the meaningful experience Shedroff calls beauty: &#8220;The appreciation of qualities that give pleasure to the senses or spirit.&#8221; The spa I went to seemed well positioned to deliver this meaningful experience. The decor was calming and simple, the products they use (and sell) are all natural, the table I laid on was the ultimate in comfort. &#8220;Bring on the beauty&#8221; my soul cried.</p>

<p>The facial was lovely. 15 mins in I looked up and asked &#8220;what kind of facial is this anyway?&#8221; She explained it was called a Simple facial but then noted that my skin looked dehydrated and I should consider the super-hydrating facial. And as an afterthought &#8220;I should tell you, it&#8217;s $20 more.&#8221; And, in the bliss of that moment, I willingly conceded to turn a blind-eye to being super-sized and said yes to the indulgent upgrade.&lt;!--more Continue Reading &raquo;--&gt;</p>

<p>At the end of the facial, I was left alone to dress. I saw the spa&#8217;s schedule on the counter. Writ large under my name was: <em>&#8220;wants simple facial, try to sell super-hydrating.&#8221;</em> Sell? Sell you say? This was about beauty, about my previously-dehydrated, now super-hydrated skin. .My feelings of bliss quickly washed away. Why? Because this crass display of commerce undermined the credibility of my experience.</p>

<p>There are other experiences like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>  On a day when you&#8217;re feeling particularly adventurous,  your hairdresser talks you into getting $80 highlights you neither need, nor want. When you get home you realize that, contrary to what he told you,  blond highlights don&#8217;t look natural when you&#8217;re a brunette.</li>
<li>  When your experience of a tourist destination is interrupted by far too many tourist shops, calling out for you to buy souvenirs. Charge me for the trip there, charge me for lunch, but don&#8217;t make me feel duped by selling me tchotchkes.</li>
<li>  When you suspect your vet, doctor, dentist, etc. is lining his pockets with tests or treatments neither you, nor your pet, really need</li>
<li>  When a health store beauty product, like<a href="http://www.burtsbees.ca/"> Burt&#8217;s Bees</a>, gets bought up and ends up in the aisles of a major pharmacy chain</li>
</ul>

<p>Beyond thinking about how to design meaningful experiences across a range of touch points, here are some tips that can help brands avoid undermining their best efforts:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Consider the long-tail: Sure, those highlights, that up-sell, or x-ray will allow you to pocket the extra dough, but what will it cost you in customer loyalty?</li>
<li>  Think about distribution. Some products feel more special when they come from specialty shops.</li>
<li>  Decide what you should charge for and what to give away. Give away tea, coffee and the simple things that make the experience more pleasurable.</li>
<li>  Make the process of paying seamless: The moment when you reach for your wallet is the moment when it can all fall apart. Don&#8217;t make people wait (too much time to think about how much it hurts the bank-account), don&#8217;t surprise them with hidden costs, don&#8217;t crowd the cash with more products (that just makes me feel worse)</li>
<li>  Help me, guide me, but don&#8217;t sell me: You can direct me to your blog where you offer tips for exfoliation or whiter teeth, but if you want to retain an ounce of cred, don&#8217;t telemarket to me.</li>
<li>  Think about what you&#8217;re selling: I&#8217;ve seen foundation being sold in a  Dermatologists office. Makeup and medicine don&#8217;t mix. In fact, it makes you look like you&#8217;re more into beauty that health.</li>
<li>  And finally, if there are any unfortunate notes around, just tuck them away so a poor soul like me doesn&#8217;t have to have a perfectly good facial ruined. I wanted to believe. I really did.</li>
</ul>
