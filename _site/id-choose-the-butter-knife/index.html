  <p><a href="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/01_introduction.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-10852" alt="01_introduction" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/01_introduction-580x389.png" width="580" height="389" /></a></p>

<p><strong><em>My name is <a href="http://www.jess-leung.com">Jess Leung</a>. </em></strong><br>
<em>I am a scientific/technical illustration student at Sheridan College and I will be completing a co-op work term at Hypenotic for the next four months.</em><br>
I couldn&#8217;t have asked for a better welcome than the, &#8220;Do you want to learn how to use the espresso machine?&#8221; that greeted me as I entered the office this morning. Thus, ushered in by caffeine and an encouraging note from Dorothy (thank you!), I started my co-op at Hypenotic.</p>

<p><strong>Why Illustration?</strong><br>
Visual syntax is innate to the human eye. It is virtually impossible to look at an image without gleaning some modicum of information be it implied or applied. To me, illustration is fueled, not only by the desire to create but the need to communicate clearly, powerfully and meaningfully. Being able to influence people and make a change with just an image is significant. It&#8217;s something I hope to do and constantly improve at.</p>

<p><strong>Navigating the Cognitive Railway System</strong><br>
<em>A map to my trains of thought.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>  &#8220;Would you rather&#8221; is a train that permeates my brain for no explicable reason that I know of. A crowd favourite is: &#8220;would you rather be beheaded with a butter knife or be eaten to death by a turtle, starting at your toes?&#8221;</li>
<li>  I <s>kind of</s> love typography and letterforms. I don&#8217;t like to play favourites but I&#8217;m currently crushing on <a href="http://www.emigre.com/EFfeatureMEoverview.php">Mr. and Mrs. Eaves</a>.</li>
<li>  Understanding and improving urban poverty is a big passion of mine.</li>
<li>  Coffee is the fuel that powers the trains, without which there would surely be a rail accident. If no coffee is available, the trains sometimes run on a backup system of humour.</li>
<li>  Sometimes I say things that don&#8217;t seem to relate in a linear manner, it simply means the train has switched tracks.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why Hypenotic?</strong><br>
Of all the design firms out there, it&#8217;s not hard to find good or even great design. As a B-Corp design firm, Hypenotic offers something more. All the work here looks to benefit and positively grow society and social construct. Like a creative, super-powered, superhero, Hypenotic is making the world a better place, one design at a time.</p>

<ul>
<li>  I love superheroes. Especially Batman.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just as one can listen without hearing, one can look without seeing. I hope always to see the world and learn all that experience can teach so that I may be a blessing to those around me. I aspire to offer all my efforts and quirkiness to this experience and look forward to receiving the same.</p>
