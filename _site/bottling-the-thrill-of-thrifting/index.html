        <h1>Bottling the Thrill of Thrifting</h1>
        <p class="meta"><span class="sub-meta">By</span>  <span class="sub-meta">in</span> category</p>
        <p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1843" title="Screen shot 2010-02-01 at 11.40.41 AM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Screen-shot-2010-02-01-at-11.40.41-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2010-02-01 at 11.40.41 AM" width="307" height="362" />What is the magical mix of elements that makes thrifting such an exciting pastime? Why do I find myself turning my steering wheel toward <a href="http://www.valuevillage.com/">Value Village </a>when I&#8217;m supposed to be going to the gym? Why do my friend and I give Olympic worthy-focus to scouring tiny thrift shops tucked into Buffalo church basements&#8211;so much so that we&#8217;re content to eat our lunches in the car en route to the next stop?</p>

<p>If someone could bottle the thrill of thrifting, they could make a fortune. Value Village has literally hitched it&#8217;s wagon to the thrifting-set. While VV is *not *owned by Walmart (a nasty rumour) it is owned by <a href="http://www.savers.com/">Savers</a>, a 200+ for-profit American chain that is owned by the private equity investment firm of <a href="http://www.freemanspogli.com/">Freeman Spogli and Company.</a> And, obviously <a href="http://www.ebay.com">ebay</a> and <a href="http://www.craigslist.org">craigslist </a>understand, and benefit from, the psychology of thrifting.</p>

<p>What is the unique *Eau De Thrift? *Can it be bottled and reproduced in other shopping experiences? * *Well, not literally. If you&#8217;ve ever walked into a thrift store there&#8217;s a distinct odour that hits you at the door. For me it&#8217;s like a welcome mat. But I wouldn&#8217;t call it pleasant.</p>

<p>What is the psychology of thrifting that makes it so appealing? Here&#8217;s my preliminary list:</p>

<ul>
<li>  <strong>It&#8217;s Meditative:</strong> Flipping through racks of random objects is downright meditative. Bill and Susan&#8217;s 10th Anniversary mug is stationed right beside a valuable Wedgewood tea cup.  And there&#8217;s no price-tag guilt to distract you from your zen-like state. The only thing to focus on is; Do I like it? Can I use it? (or can my friend use it?)</li>
<li>  *<em>There&#8217;s the Thrill of the find: *</em>In her article <a href="http://www.walletpop.com/blog/2008/01/17/the-psychology-of-thrifting-its-about-more-than-saving-money/">The Psychology of Thrifting </a>Beth Wechsler says &#8220;It&#8217;s no different than the bell that rings when the slot machine lines up just right and the coins come scrambling down.&#8221; And once you&#8217;ve scored a find, you&#8217;re entitled to bragging rights (you: nice sweater! me: Thanks. $5 bucks at Value Village)</li>
<li>  *<em>Nostalgia: *</em>Like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_Lost_Time">Proust&#8217;s Madeleine,</a> there are memories embedded in those objects. Even if they&#8217;re not my memories, these objects came from somewhere and carry a story. That tiny wall mount soap dish I found in Buffalo? I&#8217;m fascinated with who owned it (was it a little old lady? a hotel?) It&#8217;s pre-owed status just adds to it&#8217;s appeal.</li>
<li>  *<em>Doing-Good: *</em>Thrifting doesn&#8217;t hurt your pocketbook or the world. There&#8217;s really nothing to feel bad about to get in the way of all the good stuff. The objects are pre-used so no new resources went into making them. It&#8217;s recycling. And, many thrift stores are not-for-profit. <a href="http://www.goodwill.org/">Goodwill</a>, <a href="http://www.salvationarmyusa.org/usn/www_usn_2.nsf">Salvation Army</a> (we pros call Sally-Ann) are their own non-profit organizations, while other thrift shops donate all their money to charitable causes like AIDS, abused women, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><img style="float: left; border: 0px initial initial;" title="Screen shot 2010-02-01 at 12.33.21 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Screen-shot-2010-02-01-at-12.33.21-PM-210x130.png" alt="Screen shot 2010-02-01 at 12.33.21 PM" width="210" height="130" />Who&#8217;s Bottling the Thrill of Thrifting?</strong></p>

<p>Several retail stores have created shopping experiences that try to mimic some aspects of the thrifting experience. But few can replicate the entire psychological experience without selling actual thrift items.</p>

<ul>
<li>  <strong>Meditative:</strong> <a href="http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/">Urban Outfitters</a>&#8216; and <a href="http://www.anthropologie.com">Anthropologie</a>&#8216;s eclectic offerings (<a href="http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?itemdescription=true&amp;itemCount=10&amp;startValue=1&amp;selectedProductColor=&amp;sortby=&amp;id=17230608&amp;parentid=A_FURN_WALL&amp;sortProperties=+subCategoryPosition,+product.marketingPriority,-product.startDate&amp;navCount=15&amp;navAction=poppushpush&amp;color=&amp;pushId=A_FURN_WALL&amp;popId=APARTMENT_FURNISH&amp;prepushId=">Squirrel and Fox Wall Art</a> anyone?) are made for people who like to search through gobs of stuff to find a prize. But that prize won&#8217;t be cheap, and it won&#8217;t feel good.</li>
<li>  *<em>Thrill of the Find: *</em>Obviously places like <a href="http://www.walmart.com">Walmart </a>or <a href="http://www.winners.ca/en/index.asp">Winners</a> offer bargains that can make your head spin and give you bragging rights. But, again, they have that Made in China feeling that is a definite buzz kill.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Very, very few retailers can offer two essential ingredients to thrifting ; Nostalgia and Doing-good. Despite best efforts, these products always feel like empty commodities mass manufactured in China.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Tracking Down the Scent: Kiosk Kiosk</strong></p>

<p>One shop that comes closest to capturing the magical <em>Eau de Thrifting</em> is New York based <a href="http://kioskkiosk.com/">KioskKiosk</a>. Kiosk Kiosk&#8217;s website offers an eclectic bunch of finds from a given country for a limited period of time. And then, they move to the next country. So, like thrifting the opportunity is time-sensitive. Right now they&#8217;re featuring Portugal on their site. And, as someone who lives in Toronto&#8217;s Little Portugal, I can tell you, it&#8217;s a pretty wacky place.</p>

<p>Among the items currently on the site is a g<a href="http://kioskkiosk.com/c/108/p/1162/Bordallo_Pinheiro_Goat_Toothpick_Holder">oat toothpick holder</a>, <a href="http://kioskkiosk.com/c/108/p/1218/Donkey_Playing_Cards">donkey playing cards, </a> <a href="http://kioskkiosk.com/c/108/p/1236/Pica_Pau_Wood_Glue">wood glue</a>,  and<a href="http://kioskkiosk.com/c/108/p/1190/Sampling_of_Tinned_Fish_by_Tricana"> tinned fish</a>. It&#8217;s not just the objects on the site that create this effect. It&#8217;s how they are presented. They use courier font, only show one object in totally random order (there are no product catagories) and every object is photographed in a unique and often bizarre setting. The let&#8217;s run Kiosk Kiosk through our *Eau de Thrifting *checklist, shall we?</p>

<ul>
<li>  *<em>Meditative? *</em>Check. The utter randomness of objects on the site will leave you mezmerized. As you flip through the web page, each object is transformed from a kalidesope-esque image into a photograph. This is clearly deliberate</li>
<li>  *<em>Thrill of the Find? *</em>Check. Where else would you find such a random range of objects in one place? And most items are well under $50.</li>
<li>  *<em>Nostalgia? *</em>Check. Even though these items are new, they do carry an aura with them. It is the aura of another culture. Of someone&#8217;s grandmother, but it&#8217;s an aura nonetheless.</li>
<li>  *<em>Do-Good? *</em>Well&#8230;.. I realize that some of these objects may be made in far away places that are not Portugal (perhaps China, but I don&#8217;t think so). I realize they are not pre-loved by other human beings that would qualify their purchase as recycling. Their purchase does not raise money for people in need. But, this is about <em>perception</em> people. The authenticity of these exotic objects keeps them from feeling like commodities. I say &#8216;check.</li>
</ul>

<p>Are there any spots you think qualify for the <em>Eau de Thrifting</em>? I&#8217;d love to hear about them. Or, even better, great Thrift stores in Toronto, Buffalo or well&#8230;.no more than 2 hours drive. 2 hours is reasonable to go for an experience like this.</p>
