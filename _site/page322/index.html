        @SlowFoodTO: Leaving a twitter account behind

  <p>
    We learn new lessons every day here. Modern marketing is evolving so quickly that people who don&#8217;t develop an iterative approach can really suffer.<br /> But every once in a while you get the chance to explore something that&#8217;s worth sinking your teeth into. As it happens, the one that&#8217;s had my attention recently was a side-focus. A personal interest. <a href="http://www.slowfood.com/">Slow Food.</a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A guiding interest, to be sure–an interest in food issues is what led Hypenotic to start working with great local brands like the <a href="http://www.gladstonehotel.com/">Gladstone Hotel</a>, <a href="http://fiestafarms.ca/">Fiesta Farms</a>, <a href="http://www.ontarioculinary.com/">OCTA</a>, <a href="http://sustainontario.com/">Sustain Ontario</a>, <a href="http://www.fifthtown.ca/">Fifth Town Cheese</a>, <a href="http://www.southbrook.com/">Southbrook Vineyards</a>, <a href="http://www.greenbelt.ca/">The Friends of the Greenbelt Foundation</a>, <a href="http://www.localfoodplus.ca/">Local Food Plus</a> and others.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I settled on Slow Food because the designer in me was struck by the big hairy challenge of engaging a public blissfully unaware of the danger, inequality, and insufficiency of an unsustainable local food system. Slow Food&#8217;s convivial, informative and flavour focuses offered the lowest barrier approach to making people conscious of how their decisions were resulting in unconsidered, undesirable effects. I think it was initially Jodi who coined it &#8216;a gateway drug to the issues&#8217;.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It works pretty simply–eat, talk, share, enjoy. You&#8217;re hooked. But like addicts seeking to reproduce the first high, proponents need to dig deeper–change buying habits, meet producers, learn processes, participate, advocate, etc&#8230;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I hit the wall recently, though my addiction for participation wasn&#8217;t sated. Quite the opposite. I&#8217;m escalating. I&#8217;ve recently become a member of the <a href="http://www.toronto.ca/health/tfpc_index.htm">Toronto Food Policy Council</a>, as well as a Trustee of the newest<a href="http://awesomefoundation.org/chapters/food"> Awesome Foundation Chapter–Awesome Food</a>. Rather, I realized that my participation on <a href="http://slowfood.to/">Slow Food Toronto&#8217;s </a>steering committee wasn&#8217;t where I could do the most good.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here&#8217;s where the learning/sinking teeth into bit comes in. I&#8217;ve been under some pressure to leave my twitter following behind. And I&#8217;m going to acquiesce to that pressure, but not without an explanation to the folks who I&#8217;ve connected with, and not without some reflection that might benefit others. That&#8217;s just how we roll.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There are two sides to considering the appropriate path here. On one hand:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      The account was called <a href="http://twitter.com/slowfoodto">@SlowFoodTO</a>–Slow Food is a trademarked name
    </li>
    <li>
      I told the leader of the convivium (chapter) I was starting the account, did it with his blessing and kept him apprised of progress
    </li>
    <li>
      When we printed cards up, we included the twitter handle
    </li>
    <li>
      There are undoubtedly people who followed it for updates on Slow Food Toronto alone
    </li>
    <li>
      I did this in a volunteer capacity
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    On the other hand:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Twitter isn&#8217;t direct mail, and followers aren&#8217;t a list–it&#8217;s a personal, relationship-based platform
    </li>
    <li>
      I ended up spending more time with it than I expected to (conversations extended from Twitter to Friendfeed and other places)
    </li>
    <li>
      I&#8217;m uncomfortable dumping people I&#8217;ve built personal relationships with–I&#8217;m not a quitter and we started something together
    </li>
    <li>
      I did this in a volunteer capacity (yes, this goes on both lists)
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    The first list was longer.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In the next few days:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="http://twitter.com/slowreport">@SlowReport</a> will be renamed <a href="http://twitter.com/SlowFoodToronto">@SlowFoodToronto</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      Perhaps more importantly, you&#8217;ll find Paul DeCampo and Carrie Oliver sharing news there to start, perhaps others soon.
    </li>
    <li>
      I&#8217;ll share the food information our research continues to dig up through my personal account <a href="http://twitter.com/hypenoticbam">@hypenoticbam</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      I&#8217;ll continue to promote Slow Values, Initiatives and Slow Food Toronto
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>Here&#8217;s what you should consider before you&#8217;re in a similar position.</p>

<ul>
<li>  While you&#8217;re representing/promoting an entity in a volunteer position, make sure the person you answer to understands the culture of the medium you&#8217;re communicating in.</li>
<li>  Consider if clarifying your relationship is possible–can you use your own name? Variations on the theme can lead to challenges.</li>
<li>  Treat your contribution like a job–frame out what you&#8217;d like to accomplish and what resources you&#8217;re prepared to commit to get there.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks, that was fun, and I look forward to connecting in new places.</p>

<p>Barry</p>
