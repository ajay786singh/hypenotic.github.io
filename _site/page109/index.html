        Soda, Content Strategy and Bears. Oh my.

    <span class="post-date">13 Oct 2012</span>

    <p>When I heard Alex Bogusky of famed ad agency Crispin, Porter and Bogusky was <a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/01/bogusky-creative-ad-star-is-leaving-advertising/" title="Alex Bogusky leaving the field, NY Times">leaving the agency</a> to find work more in tune with his values, I kind of shrugged. I know a lot of people who made (and make) their fortune in ways that didn&#8217;t take impact into account. It&#8217;s an ongoing effort not to be judgemental about why many smart folks aren&#8217;t guided by their conscience until they&#8217;re good and comfy. It&#8217;s a flaw (because it turns out I&#8217;m not perfect). I&#8217;m working on it.</p>

<p>But I took notice of his latest effort for a few reasons, and I think you should too. It&#8217;s a video that shares a few facts about the potential effects of consuming sugary sodas regularly.</p>

<ol>
<li> It&#8217;s a pretty entertaining piece–the animation, music and messages are all swell.</li>
<li> I fear it&#8217;s getting attention because Alex is a celebrity seemingly attacking a former client, which means this is buzz, not viral, and won&#8217;t ultimately affect perceptions. Of course I hope the fear is unfounded.</li>
<li> It&#8217;s polarizing (polarbearingizing?). The very first comment on the Mashable post expresses the common right wing concern that we shouldn&#8217;t be attacking corporations. Rather, parents should educate their children so they might make better decisions. A measured responder helps the first commenter understand the research and psychology dollars and tactics parents are contending against.</li>
</ol>

<p>I sincerely hope Alex is working it out and will eventually bring his full genius to &#8216;bear&#8217; helping the public see through the &#8216;be happy&#8217; screen (that he was once such a force in weaving) to more conscious consumption.</p>

<p>The campaign is housed on a standalone site that helps you focus on 3 actions: Watch, Share, Learn.</p>

<p><a href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9972/9972/attachment/screen-shot-2012-10-13-at-october-13-11-45am" rel="attachment wp-att-9983"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-9983" title="therealbears.org page screengrab" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-shot-2012-10-13-at-October-13-11.45AM-580x405.png" alt="" width="580" height="405" /></a></p>

<p>It&#8217;s a great focused approach. Some things I might consider to make the campaign more social include:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Turn the (fascinating) litany of facts (truths) into an infographic. A glance at beautiful information might hook people not quite game to engage in a 3+ minute video. These folks might arguably be an important audience as they&#8217;re outside the community of core advocates who already support the cause. And images are pretty easy to share and post on our networks and profiles.</li>
<li>  Make each of the truths shareable via social networks and email. This can be done by adding subtle social sharing icons, or &#8220;share&#8221; icon that lists the sharing options on rollover.</li>
<li>  Write a blog post about each of the facts (that&#8217;s commentable and shareable). These can be as rich as you like, including digging into the fact in question, interviewing people who should have thoughts on it, including experts and parents.</li>
<li>  Offer a newsletter signup that gets ongoing campaign information and ideas for engaging others, highlights the efforts of campaign heros (parents and teachers, etc) in my inbox.</li>
</ul>

<p>I guess what I&#8217;m after, ultimately, is for this to be the beginning of an important conversation, and leery of letting it become the conversation itself.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>
