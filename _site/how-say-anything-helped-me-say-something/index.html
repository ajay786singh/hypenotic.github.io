<p>At Hypenotic we spend a lot of time helping clients succinctly define what they do in a way that is useful and relevant to others. We call it a brand mantra and it answers the question &#8220;What needle are you moving in the world?&#8221; We know it&#8217;s empowering and uplifting to be able to say what you&#8217;re really trying to do through your work in a few powerful words or sentences.</p>

<p>I just had a reminder in just how good it feels.</p>

<p>This week I was telling a friend about my decision to go back to school part time for Career Counselling. I was struggling to describe how a career counselling practice will connect to Hypenotic&#8217;s work with values based clients.</p>

<p>In short, in a few years from now, I plan start a branch of Hypenotic that will focus on counselling people looking for values based careers. Not sure you&#8217;re clear? Well thanks to my cinephile friend Mira and the character Lloyd Dobler things are about to get much clearer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As I was describing my vision for a Career Counselling practice my pal Mira paused and said: &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to sell anything, buy anything, or process anything&#8230;you know, as a career.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had a faint recollection of where this brilliant quote came from but it took a few moments to connect it back to the 1989 film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098258/">Say Anything</a> and Lloyd Dobler&#8217;s description of his career goals. Check this out.</p>

<p>I was lucky enough to get my first real career break when I told a career counsellor &#8220;I think I want to be in advertising, but I don&#8217;t want to sell shampoo.&#8221; Of course what I said isn&#8217;t nearly as articulate as Lloyd Dobler&#8217;s expression of existential angst over a life spent selling (buying, processing or repairing) stuff, but it was the best I could do at the time.</p>

<p>From the outside it can seem difficult if not impossible to find a career that isn&#8217;t attached to buying, selling,  processing or repairing anything bought, sold or processed. But now that I&#8217;m closer to the inside I know a ton of people who do just that&#8211;they use food to revolutionize city building (<a href="http://wx.toronto.ca/inter/health/food.nsf">Toronto Food Strategy</a>), they build capacity for social innovation (<a href="http://socialfinance.ca/about/partners/sigmars">MaRs Centre for Impact Investing</a>), they help new immigrants get what they really need to ease their transition to a new country (<a href="http://canadianimmigrant.ca/">Canadian Immigrant</a>).</p>

<p>Say Anything&#8217;s helped me Say Something. And I&#8217;m jazzed. Now I&#8217;m wondering: Are there movies that have helped you articulate something about your business or yourself that you were struggling to put into words?</p>

<p>P.S. Here&#8217;s an amazing little hack called <a href="http://lloydtube.com/">LloydTube</a> where you can make any song come out of Lloyd&#8217;s iconic boombox. I&#8217;m in love!</p>
