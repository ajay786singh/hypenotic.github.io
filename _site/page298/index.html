<p><strong>Planking 101</strong></p>

<p>I  recently heard about the growing internet craze known as “planking” where you stiffen your body into a plank position and have photos taken at strange locations. It&#8217;s so big there have even been<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43036847/ns/world_news-asia_pacific/t/australia-man-plunges-planking-death/"> &#8216;death by planking&#8217;</a> incidents, and it&#8217;s <em>sooooooo</em> big, that <a href="http://www.trendrabbit.com/2011/06/video-sexy-rosario-dawson-planking-jimmy-kimmels-desk/">Rosario Dawson planked on Jimmy Kimmel&#8217;s desk</a>!</p>

<p>The website <a href="http://www.peopleplanking.com">www.peopleplanking.com</a> is an online community for plankers which provides rules for proper planking and a forum for planking discussions. The community rates planking photos based on difficulty and outrageousness.  Location is also key; people are encouraged to add the GPS location of their plank, with countless photos showing &#8220;planks&#8221; on famous landmarks.</p>

<p>Dumbfounded by this craze, I probed to uncover its meaning and purpose. After asking countless people who partake in this bizarre activity and searching for answers online, I discovered that it&#8217;s simply one of those weird existential things; the only reason people do it, is to be a part of a community of like-minded people.</p>

<p>This got me thinking about planking&#8217;s potential as a force for good. Could planking be about more than a bunch of bored, narcissistic teens needing an outlet? I mean, dancing was just an amusement before FlashMobs showed up. Now dancing has a whole new purpose.</p>

<p><strong>Forward-Thinking Plankers</strong></p>

<p>****Turns out, there are lots of people using the powers of planking for good&#8211;and there are vital lessons we can take from it:</p>

<ul>
<li>  <a href="http://planksociety.com/2011/07/planksociety-com-supports-the-fight-against-breast-cancer/">Plank Society</a> uses planking as a means of raising awareness about breast cancer</li>
<li>  75-year-old <a href="http://media.theage.com.au/news/national-news/old-girl-planking-for-a-cause-2373691.htm">Nancy</a> planks to draw attention to to recycling</li>
<li>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGZn4Fl0ZL8&amp;feature=player_embedded#at=59">Casas por Cristo</a> planks to raise interest in engaging people to volunteer for mission trips</li>
<li>  The Taiwanese <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1390795/Planking-goes-political-Taiwanese-girls-thousands-fans-use-internet-craze-promote-promote-social-causes.html">Pujie Girls</a> plank to promote travel to tourist locations, bring attention to the plight of stray animals, etc.</li>
<li>  Other small groups are planking to raise money for <a href="http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/photos/galleries/planking-fun-and-profit/">medical research</a>, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>While it&#8217;s inherently meaningless, these groups have reinvented planking and harnessed its tremendous power.</p>

<p><strong>What These Socially Minded Plankers Can Teach Us</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>  People enjoy being a part of something bigger than themselves. We are programmed to crave community</li>
<li>  Their loyalty to these communities and causes stretch far and wide- there&#8217;s no limit to the time, energy and money they&#8217;ll spend to continue being a part of it</li>
<li>  Where there are communities of like-minded people, there is hope for creating social change</li>
</ul>

<p>Given this, consider how you can tap into something people are already doing. Empowering an already active and connected community is a great- and yes, inexpensive- shortcut to drawing attention and gaining new audiences.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s no stopping these fad-happy-folks, so use them to your advantage- and ultimately to the advantage of the community as a whole- &#8217;cause heck, you may even have fun doing it!</p>
