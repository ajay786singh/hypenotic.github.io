        <h1>Food matters. And so does building community.</h1>
        <p class="meta"><span class="sub-meta">By</span>  <span class="sub-meta">in</span> category</p>
        <p>Mark Bittman was in Toronto this week promoting his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Food-Matters-Cookbook-Revolutionary-Recipes/dp/1439120234/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1284660910&amp;sr=1-1">Food Matters Cookbook. </a>I&#8217;ve long been a fan of Bittman and have followed him as he&#8217;s embraced a more values based approach to eating&#8211;for which he&#8217;s now become a key spokesperson. His TED talk on <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/mark_bittman_on_what_s_wrong_with_what_we_eat.html">What&#8217;s Wrong with What we Eat</a> makes a great case for reducing our consumption of meat and junk and tipping the scales in favour of a plant based diet.</p>

<p>Prior to Bittman&#8217;s talk at <a href="http://www.thestop.org/">The Stop&#8217;s</a> Wychwood Barns, I saw this tweet (via a great tool called <a href="http://www.socialmention.com/">Social Mention</a>) that said that Bittman was at <a href="http://www.fiestafarms.ca">Fiesta Farms,</a> filming something for a <a href="http://www2.macleans.ca/">Maclean&#8217;s magazine </a>article.</p>

<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-3036" href="http://hypenotic.com/socialmedia-2/3035/food-matters-and-so-does-building-community/attachment/screen-shot-2010-09-29-at-11-27-25-am"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3036" title="Screen shot 2010-09-29 at 11.27.25 AM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Screen-shot-2010-09-29-at-11.27.25-AM.png" alt="" width="359" height="191" /></a></p>

<p>Heard of him? Yeah, I heard of him.</p>

<p>As you may know, Fiesta Farms is one of Hypenotic&#8217;s clients. So, it would have been nice to capture Bittman in the aisles of the store, or even get him to say a few words about what he enjoyed about his experience. But I figured the next best thing would be to go to his book launch event (which frankly I was planning to do anyway) with my little <a href="http://www.theflip.com/en-ca/">Flip camera </a>in hand.</p>

<p>After the talk I was a little dismayed when Bittman&#8217;s publicity people treated folks who wanted books signed like children; asking us to come up row by row and putting a little sticky note with our names on  them on the inside flap where Bittman would so graciously sign. Way to take all the personalization out of the meet + greet process folks.</p>

<p>When the signings were finished, I waited for my moment. I politely asked Bittman for a few words about his experience at Fiesta Farms and asked if it&#8217;d be ok if I filmed him. Though he obliged, as you can see from this video, he was irritated by my filming. He was literally packing up as we were talking.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve now had a chance to read Bittman&#8217;s account of his time in Toronto in his <a href="http://markbittman.com/the-food-matters-cookbook-chronicles-toronto">Food Matters Chronicles</a> and the pieces of the puzzle are coming together.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am just going to say it. Bittman&#8217;s a bit of a curmudgeon when it comes to social media.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In his Chronicles, Bittman recalls his lunch with <a href="http://www.goodfoodrev.com/">Good Food Revolution&#8217;</a>s Malcolm Jolley in the following way:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a sit-down with Malcolm Jolley of Good Food, who insisted on taping the conversation with a little camera in front of his face the whole time, which seems to be au courant, though why you&#8217;d rather plough through a video in real time than read a writer&#8217;s analysis of it is beyond me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bittman, like Jolley, is a food writer (for the <a href="http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/author/mark-bittman/">New York Times</a>.) Clearly, Bittman puts the written word up on a pedestal. But, in the age of social media, why is &#8216;telling&#8217; better (or more journalistic) than &#8216;showing?&#8217;  Good Food Rev mixes up high quality writing and high quality video. The combination makes for a dynamic, readable online publication. Anyway, why dis another food journalist out there spreading the gospel? We all have the same agenda around food, don&#8217;t we?</p>

<p>In addition, Bittman misidentifies Jolley&#8217;s publication as &#8220;Good Food&#8221; not Good Food Revolution and doesn&#8217;t even bother to embed the url to Good Food Revolution to drive more people to the site. Bittman gets alot of readers on his site. It would have been very generous to properly identify the publication and share the link.</p>

<p>If you want to be part of a food community, you should give kudos to those working to spread the word. Good Food Revolution covering the Food Matters Cookbook means more cookbook sales for Mark Bittman. So maybe he could be less grumpy. But even more important, promoting good food grows the entire movement. How &#8217;bout you throw Malcolm a bone by promoting the good work on his site Mr. Bittman?</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s not the only factoid that Mark Bittman got wrong. If you scroll down the page to the comments, you can see that Jason McBride, Communications Coordinator at <a href="http://www.thestop.org/">The Stop</a>, bothered to write a comment to correct Bittman&#8217;s misspelling of &#8216;Wychwood&#8217; and to identify <a href="http://www.thestop.org/">The Stop&#8217;s</a> link so Bittman&#8217;s gazillion readers could find their way to this fabulous &#8220;Food Matters&#8221; type organization.</p>

<p>At the same time Mark Bittman tries to elevate his type of &#8220;written&#8221;  food journalism (the New York Times type I guess) he demonstrates that his fact-checking chops are as weak as his social media muscles. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I like Mark Bittman and what he stands for. But, he could use a lesson in supporting the food community that matters, not only to selling books, but to changing the world.</p>
