    <span class="post-date">10 Aug 2010</span>

    <p><a rel="attachment wp-att-2674" href="http://hypenotic.com/branding/2672/shut-up-and-let-me-go/attachment/screen-shot-2010-08-10-at-12-08-46-pm"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2674" title="Screen shot 2010-08-10 at 12.08.46 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-10-at-12.08.46-PM.png" alt="" width="314" height="293" /></a>Had a fun run-in with a day camp staffer who informed me that I would not be able to receive a refund for a camp position my daughter would no longer need.</p>

<p>I wasn&#8217;t charged an administrative fee to cover the costs of filling the position again (there&#8217;s a waiting list). This was a punitive slap on the arse no money back guarantee. Let me repeat. No. Money. Back.</p>

<p>And this from a camp that sent my daughter home with the lyrics to the song &#8216;<a href="http://www2.gol.com/users/quakers/simple_gifts.htm">Simple Gifts&#8217;</a> hand scrawled on a scrap of paper because a dear, sweet counsellor overheard her singing it and encouraged her to share it with the group (sniff).</p>

<p>The camp is behaving like cell phone companies who have contracts that protect *their *interests with little thought for what would serve their customers best.</p>

<p>On the other hand, some notable companies have incredibly simple exit plans that make it virtually seamless for you to go elsewhere. One shining example is the online billing service <a href="http://www.freshbooks.com/">Freshbooks. </a>Freshbooks lives up to its tagline &#8220;Painless Billing&#8221; by allowing you to leave, or downgrade your account with no questions asked. No one will ask you why you&#8217;re leaving or negotiate to get you to stay. You simply click a a button and off you go.</p>

<p>Another notable example is the small  business software company<a href="http://37signals.com/"> 37 Signals. </a>Their philosophy is based on letting their customers outgrow them. In their book <a href="http://37signals.com/rework/">Rework</a>, the company&#8217;s founders Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson say that they realize they can&#8217;t be all things to all people, and that when some companies &#8220;grow up&#8221; they&#8217;ll move on to other software companies. In short &#8220;Scaring away new customers is worse than losing old customers.&#8221;</p>

<p>When you&#8217;re willing to let customers exit without pain and suffering you&#8217;re saying several important things about your brand:</p>

<ul>
<li>  You are thinking about your customers&#8217; needs over your own</li>
<li>  You know who you are and who you aren&#8217;t&#8211;and that what you&#8217;re offering isn&#8217;t for everyone</li>
<li>  You aren&#8217;t just being punitive. Sure there may be costs when someone goes. And it&#8217;s fair to pass those on. But, don&#8217;t just do it because you&#8217;re angry and want to punish somebody</li>
<li>  You&#8217;re confident in your own abilities. You don&#8217;t need to force me to love you, I&#8217;m going to love you just because you&#8217;re so great at doing what you do</li>
<li>  You want me to pass you on. I may not want to use you anymore, but that doesn&#8217;t mean we can&#8217;t still be friends and I can&#8217;t say really nice things about you to other people</li>
</ul>

<p>So let&#8217;s not make this whole breakup thing so painful. There are lots of reasons why people have to move on. Some of them very innocuous. So let&#8217;s part on happy terms, shall we?</p>

<p>Oh, and can I have my jeans back?</p>
