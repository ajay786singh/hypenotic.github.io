<p>In his book <a href="http://www.trustagent.com/">Trust Agents</a>, Chris Brogan says &#8220;Building an army, especially a loosely-joined and flexible group of people from many disciplines, is the key to being an advanced trust agent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course everyone wants to build an army&#8211;a mass of followers from all walks of life. But the critical question is <em>when</em> you start building your army. You don&#8217;t want to start asking folks to join you when you need something from them. That&#8217;s called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription">conscription</a> and it&#8217;s not generally popular. Social networking platforms don&#8217;t allow for conscription&#8211;so folks often resort to tactics like guilt, pleading and invoking a sense of duty.</p>

<p>However, being useful and relevant&#8211;giving not taking&#8211;is key to enlist people in a cause that is bigger than yourself; your event, your cause, your services, and whatever else you&#8217;re trying to sell.</p>

<p>Two authors, Rebecca Skloot and James Beckerman, both with wildly successful books, started sharing and building communities of interest long before they ever had books to sell.</p>

<p>Skloot&#8217;s ten year journey to write her book <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Immortal-Life-Henrietta-Lacks/dp/1400052173">The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</a> was thoughtfully chronicled by the author who let her community in on what she was was discovering while getting to know Henrietta Lacks, the impoverished African American woman whose HeLa cells transformed modern medicine. Skloot turned the process inside out and engaged her readers long before there was ever a book. She talked about a broad range of issues on science and ethics&#8211;the core area of exploration in her book. Today she has over <a href="http://twitter.com/rebeccaskloot">eleven thousand followers on Twitter</a> not to mention a best selling book that has been optioned as an <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/12/oprah-to-produce-immortal_n_573647.html">HBO film by Oprah Winfrey.</a></p>

<p>Another writer that I&#8217;ve been watching for sometime is Portland Cardiologist James Beckerman who just launched his book <a href="http://www.theflexdiet.com/">The Flex Diet.</a> Just yesterday Canadian doctor  and blogger  <a href="http://www.weightymatters.ca/">Yoni Freedhoff</a> reviewed the book, calling Beckerman &#8220;a socially networked cardiologist.&#8221; The point is, long before there was a book, Beckerman was sharing useful tips, tools and resources that helped people lose weight. Twitter was the perfect medium for sharing small tips on weight management, which is the premise of the Flex Diet.  Today Beckerman has written over 2,700 tweets and has over a thousand followers. So when his book finally launched, lots of folks were already fans of his approach to weight management.</p>

<p>The point is this; Don&#8217;t start your social networking journey when you are ready to ask people to do something for you. Don&#8217;t start making friends so you have people to invite to your birthday party.  People who like you want to celebrate your achievements&#8211;but they need to know you first. So, what can you share that would help people get engaged in the mission you&#8217;re on long before you have anything to ask of them? What &#8216;bits&#8217; of your journey would be useful and relevant to others? The time to get started is now.</p>
