  <h1 class="post-title">How to bike through winter in Toronto</h1>

  <p><img class="alignnone" title="Guide to winter cycling " src="http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lxntdwlk7d1ql0mrko1_500.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></p>

<p>Cycling through the city is a very popular activity during the summer, however lots of people in Toronto decide to leave their bike in storage for the winter season. Personally, I find that the benefits of biking every day are bigger than the obstacles, so I try to keep going year round.</p>

<p>Here are some the things I find helpful to overcome many of the inconveniences of biking in cold weather.</p>

<ol>
<li> Personal gear: You really don’t need a lot more than what you normally use for winter. Your body gets warm fairly quickly so you just need to focus on covering your head: tuk and helmet or hoodie*; face: glasses and bandana; hands: good pair of mittens and feet: snow boots or rubber boots plus some heavy socks. *Be careful when using a hoodie because it blocks peripheral vision.</li>
<li> Bike gear: Obviously lights are key, fenders will save you from most of the splattering water ponds, slush or whatever’s on the ground, but the thing that changed my life was getting a rearview mirror. This may apply always when riding your bike in the city, but the rearview mirror is especially helpful in winter when you’re wearing your parka hoodie and you can’t turn back very easily. You can get one at <a href="http://www.mec.ca/AST/ShopMEC/Cycling/BellsMirrorsReflectors/PRD~4011-495/mec-mountain-cycling-mirror.jsp" target="_blank">MEC</a> for only 5 dollars.</li>
<li> Choosing your route. If it snowed recently it is better to stay on main streets because cars and traffic clear the snow faster so you don’t have to deal with it.  For the same reason, bike lanes accumulate ice and slush and it is better to avoid them. I also prefer to stick with the most direct route so I don’t spend more time outside than necessary.</li>
<li> Change of clothes. There are some days of continuous light rain when biking will save you lots of streetcar waiting time and crowded subways, you just have to be willing to get wet. I wear a long raincoat and rubber boots so I only have to change my tights when I get to the office. I suggest you try it; after all it is only water falling from the sky not sulfuric acid.</li>
<li> Know your limits. There’s a balance between pushing yourself to overcome a challenge and putting yourself in danger. Not everyday is a cycling day, I can tell you from experience that riding your bike through a blizzard or heavy rain is a bad idea mainly because you can’t really see and neither can cars around you. I would also not ride if the streets were not clear. I guess it all comes down to common sense.</li>
<li> Enjoy all the benefits. You save money and time. You keep yourself fit and fight any possible winter blues with physical activity. You don’t get stuck in traffic jams and you get exactly where you want to go without depending on anything other that yourself and your bike, that is what I call freedom.<img class="alignnone" src="http://4000more.org/4000more.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/screen-shot-2011-01-05-at-12-34-39-amaf90.png?w=600" alt="" width="397" height="253" /></li>
</ol>

<p>Just as I was about to finish this blog post, my boss Barry sent me this invitation from the <a title="Toronto Cyclists Union" href="http://bikeunion.to/" target="_blank">Toronto Cyclists Union</a> for an event called <a title="365 Days of Cycling" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/upcoming#!/events/254874251252725/" target="_blank">365 Days of Biking&#8221; &#8211; An Evening of art and Cycling</a>  happening this next Thursday February 2nd at the Centre for Social Innovation. I might go and check it out, take a look.</p>
