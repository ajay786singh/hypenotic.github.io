</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not the &#8220;official&#8221; boss at Hypenotic. The bald guy at the big desk gets that honour. But I <em>am</em> the boss of me.</p>

<p>Likewise, you may not be the boss of some big important company like Hypenotic. But I can assure you that you are the boss of your life.</p>

<p>After reading <a href="http://www.danpink.com/books/drive">Dan Pink&#8217;s Drive,</a> I have to admit I&#8217;m doing a pretty poor job of being the boss of me and I&#8217;ve either got to fire myself (but who would replace me?) or give myself a serious review and make some changes.</p>

<p>The premise of Pink&#8217;s book is the management world needs a new operating system that reflects what science figured out long ago; Thinking, creative people need more than money to get them to do good work. People want to be self directed, experience the joy of mastering skills and see that they&#8217;re connected to a higher purpose.</p>

<p>By adopting a management style that allows for mastery, autonomy and purpose, Pink argues, you create &#8220;conditions for people to do their best work.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, I ask myself: &#8220;As the boss of myself, do I create the conditions for me to do my best work?&#8221; No sir, I do not.</p>

<p>Autonomy, according to Pink is the essential to the new management model. In short Pink tells us to stop using management as a euphemism for &#8220;controlling people&#8221; and instead use it as a tool to &#8220;reawaken&#8221; employees&#8217; &#8220;deep-seated sense of autonomy.&#8221; For Pink, autonomy means &#8220;acting with choice.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the boss of Jodi Incorporated, I don&#8217;t act with much choice. I rarely unglue my butt from the chair to get a glasses of water, I often avoid fraternizing with my co-workers for hours on end because of self imposed time pressures. In short, even though I&#8217;m in a fun, dynamic workplace I&#8217;m stuck in an old management style where I treat myself as a  &#8220;human resource&#8221; rather than human being.</p>

<p>What will it take for me to become a better boss? Here are a few ideas, but I&#8217;m looking to you for more:</p>

<ul>
<li>  <strong>I will go for walks.</strong> I will remove the imaginary seat belt that keeps me tied to this desk chair and I will go outside and breathe oxygen. Sometimes I will come back with herbal tea.</li>
<li>  <strong>I will drink water.</strong> The problem with drinking water is that it&#8217;s such a huge time suck. You not only have to walk the 20 feet to the sink, but then afterwards you have to go to pee. It&#8217;s such a drag. But I find I get some of my best ideas in the quiet of the bathroom stall. I will use that as my excuse to drink more.</li>
<li>  <strong>I will work from the Gladstone</strong>. It may just be the caffeine, but I swear I&#8217;m out-of-my-mind-happy when I decide to work outside the office . I am so productive it&#8217;s crazy. Why do I make myself toil away at my desk when I don&#8217;t have to? I&#8217;m liberating myself to leave this place and go to my favorite café down the road. Once a week at least.</li>
</ul>

<p>So how about you? Are you a good boss when it comes to running your own show or do you need to modernize your work style when it comes to being the boss of yourself? I&#8217;m seriously looking for some ideas here.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>The Management</p>
