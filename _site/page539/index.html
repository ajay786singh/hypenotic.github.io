    <p>Conventional gyms are a total turnoff. The promotions make you feel ripped off; the staff make you feel duped; the space makes you feel like a total loser. Not very motivating. If working out makes you feel good, you do it. These places don&#8217;t make me feel like working out.</p>

<p>In total opposition is the YMCA. Now this is a brand that lives its mission across every touchpoint. It&#8217;s not about ads or promotions. It&#8217;s about doing the right thing for members and the community time and again. It&#8217;s a feel-good place and experience. It makes me want to work out. </p>

<p>Why am I having a love affair with the Y? </p>

<ol>
<li> One flat fee for membership makes me feel like I&#8217;ve been treated fairly. It&#8217;s not cheap, but I don&#8217;t mind.</li>
<li> The space is open, low-key without all the mirrors and bells and whistles. I feel relieved by the lack of pretension.</li>
<li> I twice hear staff explain how lower income members could have their membership fees adjusted. I believe I am part of a community-based organization.</li>
<li> There&#8217;s childcare and an amazing kids&#8217; club and play structure where my kids can hang out while mommy gets a little bit of a workout. They understand and care about my realities. </li>
<li> The staff are helpful. Twice, two different staff people didn&#8217;t just point me in the right direction&#8230;they walked me there. I feel like these people actually give a crap.</li>
</ol>

<p>The lessons here are pretty simple:</p>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      It&#8217;s not what you say, it&#8217;s what you do. <ul>
        <li>
          Lots of gyms tell me they want me to go to the gym after I pay my dues, but very few make me feel like they understand what I need. To work out I need childcare, helpful staff, a fair price I know is the same one as the guy sweating on the StairMaster beside me.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      It&#8217;s not about money. It&#8217;s about value for money. Most people are willing to pay for a positive experience with a brand they&#8217;re proud to associate with.  <ul>
        <li>
          The fact that the Y wants to prorate it&#8217;s membership fees based on what people can afford makes me proud. The many ways it tells me it&#8217;s part of the community makes me proud.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <div>
    The sweating part sucks. But, the gym doesn&#8217;t. What a relief.
