<p>Like many small, passionate businesses, here at the Hypenotic headquarters everyone wears different hats depending on what is needed and who is available to do what. You might be an Illustrator who works primarily for print, but is asked to do a Photoshop mockup for a Facebook landing page. You could be an Art Director who needs to get a handle on the inner workings of WordPress. Or better yet, you could be the Developer asked to make coffee for everyone, while dancing on your head. Whatever it is, usually throughout the day you are tasked to do something outside of your primary job description.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  In terms of the web, understanding design fundamentals and future trends, being proficient at Photoshop, knowing PHP and MySQL, knowing your way around a server and a couple of CMS systems is critical to your success as a Hybrid Web Designer/Developer. Not only that, but it is extremely helpful in being able to see the big picture when it comes to brainstorming ideas, creative strategy, pushing projects ahead and perhaps most importantly, what is technically possible based on the clients design inspirations framed by the project budget and timeline.
</p>

<p>Essentially, developers who can design and designers who can code are the jack of all trades. Knowing one informs the other. As Jolie O&#8217;Dell from Mashable writes,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Good designers and developers rule the web — they’re the ones who build it, after all. And some of the most interesting and useful players in creating the modern Internet are hybrids between those two disciplines — people who can translate between the disparate languages of the visual and the technical.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/09/08/hybrid-designer-developers/">ton of resources</a> for those of you who are designers who want to delve into code or a developers who want to visualize the future.  For myself, I love doing both and would encourage anyone who is interested in doing the same. Currently, I have my TextWrangler open on one screen, Photoshop on the other and fresh coffee on my desk. What do you think?</p>
