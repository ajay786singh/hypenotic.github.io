<p>The issue of climate change poses a number of serious marketing challenges: It&#8217;s complicated, it&#8217;s scary, it&#8217;s abstract. This leads many to look the other way, or worse, throw on a light jacket and talk about what an &#8220;amazing day&#8221; it is in the middle of January.</p>

<p>Last week, an article in the Toronto Star titled <a href="http://www.thestar.com/sports/hockey/juniorhockey/article/1140077--death-of-backyard-rinks-linked-to-climate-change">Death of Backyard Rinks Linked to Climate Change</a> demonstrated how to market climate change and make it immediate, concrete and relevant. The key is speaking to communities of interest.</p>

<p>Researchers have determined that climate change will bring on a &#8220;significant shortening of the outdoor hockey season&#8221; in Canada. By highlighting this particular fact, this research became relevant to hockey lovers who cherish this national past time. For these (largely) guys the prospect of there being no more Wayne Gretskys–all within four decades&#8211; is unimaginable.</p>

<p>The researcher targeted specific communities of interest, and in so doing made the information matter.</p>

<p>Now, the key will be to find ways to create deeper engagement among these Canadian Hockey lovers so that the connection between outdoor hockey and climate change is deeply ingrained.</p>

<p>Here are some suggestions for how I could see environmental organizations working together to leverage the power of hockey lovers to tackle climate change:</p>

<ul>
<li>  There&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.wohc.ca/">World Outdoor Hockey Tournament</a>, the <a href="http://www.uspondhockey.com/">US Pond Hockey Tournament </a> and many others. Every year hockey-freaks gather at these events to celebrate playing the game (again quoting from the US Pond Hockey site) &#8220;the way nature intended.&#8221; Environmental groups have an opportunity to tap into the sense of nostalgia, manliness and connection to nature that truly resonates for these players. Hey <a href="http://environmentaldefence.ca/">Environmental Defence</a>, form a team, set up a booth, interview the players about climate change and share the video, tweet from the event and set up a facebook group to Save Outdoor Hockey Rinks.</li>
<li>  Start an Outdoor Hockey Tournament Fundraiser. There&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.scotiabankproam.com/toronto/index.shtml">Pro Am Skate for Alzheimers</a>. It&#8217;s an established model, but doing this in connection to climate change on an outdoor rink makes tons of sense. Hey<a href="http://www.sierraclub.ca/"> Sierra Club</a>, I&#8217;m talking to you.</li>
<li>  Sell outdoor rink kits as a social enterprise venture. <a href="http://www.notfarfromthetree.org/archives/2157">Not Far From the Tree sold maple syrup kits</a> for $50 because it was connected to their mission. Well guess what environmental groups? Now outdoor rinks are connected to yours. And these kits are in high demand as dads everywhere do their best to build rinks in an ever warming climate. And hey, <a href="http://www.davidsuzuki.org/">David Suzuki Foundation</a>, make sure they&#8217;re made out of recycled materials.</li>
</ul>
