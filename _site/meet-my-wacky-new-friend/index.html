<p>Upon an initial encounter with architecture school, exhibitions, and lectures, one will notice that the <del>colour</del> black is a big old favourite. If one&#8217;s creative, they&#8217;ll throw in some vibrant splashes of grey. A truly venturous one will dare a [real] colour or two as an accent piece.</p>

<p>When it comes to graphic design relating to architectural design, the graphics must always be tame enough to let the architecture keep the spotlight. You will find size zero pt. linework and thin, sans typography, all caps, discreetly shying away in their 10pt textboxes. Everything is streamlined, slick, minimalist. Architects have pet fonts, the go-to assumed to be good for all occasions (DIN and I are like Linus and his blue blanket). And, I suppose that works for them.</p>

<p>You might recall in a previous post that I was itching to try something different for this internship. With graphic design and illustration being the stars of this show, I am being given a makeover in my visual thinking.</p>

<p>Graphics and typography in architecture point to the architectural drawings and renderings, which in turn convey the message.<br>
Here, however, the point is still to get the message across, but the twist is that the language is purely graphic. Type and pictures come together wearing shiny bright outfits that catch peoples&#8217; attention; all the while there still exists principal as well as supporting actors.</p>

<p>That said, there is a certain level of shock (followed by delight) that comes when you realize several things:</p>

<ul>
<li>  <span style="line-height: 13px;">Colour is your friend. Colours have colour friends. Good ol&#8217; grey will get along with them just fine. </span></li>
<li>  It&#8217;s O.K. to use funky, loopy, chunky, BIG typography. What&#8217;s a party without a diva?</li>
<li>  It is important to maintain hierarchy. Too many divas in one room results in cat-brawls.</li>
<li>  Compact is cool, but not everything needs to be flatpacked. Type needs its personal space.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have also learned that dijon goes really well with tuna.</p>
