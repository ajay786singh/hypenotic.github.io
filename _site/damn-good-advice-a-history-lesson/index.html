  <p>Summer is proving to be a bit of a challenge for Hypenotic&#8217;s crack (or cracked?) team of bloggers. <a href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9487/what-a-lake-can-teach-you-about-life">In a previous post</a> I noted that when it comes to blog posts, &#8220;focus breeds discipline.&#8221;</p>

<p>To that end I&#8217;m kicking off a series that Barry, Lionel, Rick, Chris, Collin &amp; Amanda will run with in the following weeks (hear that gang?) It&#8217;s called &#8220;Damn Good Advice&#8221;</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the idea; Somehow or other we&#8217;ve all ended up at a values-based enterprise where doing good matters most. How did we get here? This series is intended to give a brief glimpse into the (morally superior) people we&#8217;ve become. So, without further ado&#8230;..</p>

<p><a href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9573/damn-good-advice-a-history-lesson/attachment/damngoodadvice-2" rel="attachment wp-att-9603"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9603" title="damngoodadvice" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/damngoodadvice1.png" alt="" width="382" height="201" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  It went down after a History 101 tutorial during my first year of undergrad.
</p>

<p>I cornered my T.A under the guise of asking some questions about the final exam, but what I was really after was someone to help me feel like I could deal with the end-of-semester pressure that was crushing me.</p>

<p>Years later I figured out I had an anxiety issue when the whole thing spun out of control.  But at that time it was just gut rot, pressure on my chest, and a general sense of impending doom that could only find relief in ceaseless work (punctuated by ceaseless smoking and bathing in heavy rotation.)</p>

<p>The conversation with the young History 101 T.A turned from the assignment to the bigger picture. Passover was coming up, my family would be gathering for dinner and I was totally conflicted about whether I could make the trip from London, ON to Toronto for the weekend. All of this very important work was on my plate and if I didn&#8217;t sit my ass down I would never get it done. Then I would fail and my life would basically suck.</p>

<p>After patiently listening to my litany of concerns, the kind T.A leaned forward, looked me in the face and very simply said &#8220;Jodi, go home.&#8221; I&#8217;m usually not much of a listener when I&#8217;m in an anxious state. Let&#8217;s say the voices in my head can be pretty loud. But this simple advice cut through everything and went straight to my bones. I immediately knew he was right.</p>

<p>I made the trip home. My 3 foot nothing Bubbie Rosie greeted me with a hug, and the greasy Passover food nourished my weary soul. I remembered I was a human being, not a fucking exam machine. It gave me what I needed to get through the semester.</p>

<p>Truth be told I&#8217;m still working on putting this good advice into practice.  20 years later I&#8217;m getting better at not &#8220;forcing it.&#8221; Last year I wrote about <a href="http://hypenotic.com/fun-stuff/6630/3-ways-to-avoid-doing-the-hustle">&#8220;Not Doing the Hustle&#8221;</a> or trying not to buy what Abe Lincoln said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Good things may come to those who wait. But only the things left by those who hustle.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s a noble struggle and a life&#8217;s work. In short, I&#8217;m still trying to take his advice.</p>

<p>This graffiti image snapped on the streets of Cambridge (thanks Tonya Surman) pretty much sums it up.</p>
