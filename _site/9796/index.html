<p>I&#8217;m taking this course through <a href="www.coursera.org">Coursera</a> entitled <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/gamification">Gamification</a>. Like so many of you, I consider myself a &#8220;gamer.&#8221; Naturally I figured this course would be right up my alley.</p>

<p>Having had the liberty of attending a lecture by <a href="http://janemcgonigal.com/">Jane McGonigal</a>, I had already been introduced to certain attributes of Gamification. She touched on why games make us better people, and how they can in fact change the world. Needless to say, I quickly developed an understanding of why we need to make time to play in our busy lives.</p>

<p>Gamification itself is a fairly new concept that is growing at an exponential rate. It&#8217;s not all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goomba">Goombas</a> and <a href="http://www.angrybirds.com/">Projectiles</a> like some of you may think. In fact, it&#8217;s a sophisticated psychological take on how we interact with the world around us.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a well-thought-out combination of Game Elements, Techniques and Designs that are strategically placed in non-game applications and processes. The end result is a more engaging and effective learning experience. You also get <a href="http://themushroomkingdom.net/sounds/wav/smw/smw_1-up.wav">points</a>. People like points.</p>

<p>There are, in fact 3 categories to Gamification: External (marketing, sales, customer engagement), Internal (Productivity, Crowdsourcing), and my personal favourite, Behavioural Change (health and wellness, sustainability, and personal finance).</p>

<p>Back in 2010, <a href="http://www.vw.ca/en.html">Volkswagen</a> held a Competition (note the External Game Element in a Marketing setting) called <a href="http://www.thefuntheory.com/">The Fun Theory</a>. The purpose was to come up with something &#8220;fun&#8221; that would make a positive change. The winner, Kevin Richardson, developed the Speed Camera Lottery to make a positive change in traffic safety. His idea was so good, that Volkswagen, together with <a href="http://www.sweden.se/eng/Home/Society/Reading/Road-safety/">The Swedish National Society for Road Safety</a>, actually made this innovative idea a reality in Stockholm, Sweden. During a 3-day period, the overall driving speed dropped by 22%.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both Volkswagen and Kevin used various Game-like Elements to engage people, getting them to make a positive change in their behaviour, which in turn mades the roads safer for everyone.</p>

<p>Whether you call it <em>Gamification</em> or <em>Fun Theory</em>, in the end its all about positive change. And of course, the points.</p>
