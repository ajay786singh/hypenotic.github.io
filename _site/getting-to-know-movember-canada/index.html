And that&#8217;s part of the fun.</p>

<p>This blog post was inspired by a readers comment that raised a question prompting me to do a bit of digging.</p>

<p>Someone calling themselves *No Mo Here *posted the following comment on the W<a href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/3788/were-getting-behind-movember">e&#8217;re Getting Behind Movember</a> blog post. The writer commented:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-style: normal;">&#8220;Raising funds for Prostate Cancer Canada is positive and Movember is a great idea but, 15% of donations for Movember goes directly into the pocket of the Movember founder. It&#8217;s a little secret that this campaign doesn&#8217;t want you to know. Not all funds goes to fighting Prostate Cancer. Booo.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>No Mo Here *<span style="font-style: normal;">raised an interesting issue. Who exactly </span></em>is *this mystical organization called<a href="http://ca.movember.com/"> </a><span style="font-style: normal;"><a href="http://ca.movember.com/">Movember Canada</a>? And how do they make a living? On this, the last day of Movember, I thought I&#8217;d help elucidate and clear the air.</span></p>

<p>It&#8217;s not entirely surprising that someone like <em>No Mo *posted his/her comment. The truth is, I was also confused about who was behind Movember and its relationship to Prostate Cancer in general, and Prostate Cancer Canada in particular. While I&#8217;m a big fan of Movember, I would say that &#8220;Movember the social </em>movement&#8221;* (men donning &#8216;staches for Prostate Cancer)  is well executed, but &#8220;Movember the <em>organization&#8221;</em> not well articulated or understood.</p>

<p>So, I called Jesse Hayman, Campaign Coordinator for Movember Canada to get a better understanding of these Movember folks, and here&#8217;s what I found out:</p>

<ol>
<li> *<em>Movember is non-profit: *</em>In Canada, Movember is a non profit organization but they don&#8217;t have charitable status. That means they can raise money but they can&#8217;t issue tax receipts. <a href="http://www.prostatecancer.ca/">Prostate Cancer Canada</a> issues tax receipts on their behalf. As a non profit, they each make salaries, but no money is going into anyone&#8217;s pocket&#8211;not even the founder&#8217;s.</li>
<li> *<em>They&#8217;re friendly: *</em>Movember Canada&#8217;s offices are within Prostate Cancer Canada&#8217;s offices. They are separate organizations, but they sit together, and play nicely together. They are friends. Aw.</li>
<li> *<em>They&#8217;re in the awareness business: *</em>Movember is a public education engine. They deliver awareness and generate funds. They don&#8217;t deliver services to folks dealing with Prostate Cancer. That&#8217;s Prostate Cancer Canada&#8217;s job. And PCC does a very good job of delivering services  through research, support, education and more. That&#8217;s why Movember Canada directs all funds to them.</li>
<li> <strong>They&#8217;re a lean, mean awareness machine.</strong> They employ 3 staff full time in Canada. The rest of the work and outreach is done by volunteers across the country</li>
<li> *<em>They have costs: *</em>The 15% raised by Movember Canada does not go into the founder&#8217;s pocket. Rather 15% of the money raised through Movember goes to pay for staff, infrastructure, materials, etc. to run a rockingly good organization moving the needle on a crucial health issue. According to <a href="http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&amp;cpid=48">Charity Navigator</a>, organizations that spend 33.3% or less on expenses to raise money are doing their jobs just fine, thank you. Movember Canada is well within this range. But, they say they&#8217;re always trying to lower their administrative costs.</li>
<li> <strong>They do alot of good:</strong> Last year Movember Canada raised $7.8 million for Prostate Cancer. This year, they&#8217;re headed toward the $20 million dollar mark. I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s pretty super-fantastic. If you ran a business that grossed $20 million on netted $17 million, you&#8217;d feel pretty darned good about yourself. Let&#8217;s give Movember Canada a round of applause puhlease!</li>
<li> *<em>They could do better: *</em>Movember Canada and Movember in general could do a better job of positioning themselves within this very important movement. That would help others trust their motivations and understand their strong connection to the issue of Prostate Cancer, and Prostate Cancer Canada. If that helps people part with their money than all the better.</li>
</ol>

<p>So there you go *No Mo Here, *maybe now that I&#8217;ve cleared things up you can rename yourself *Grow Mo Here *when Movember rolls around again.</p>

<p>Happy last day of Movember everyone!</p>
