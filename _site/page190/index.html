<p>A Smart Car isn&#8217;t just a car&#8211;it&#8217;s an idea. Sure, sure. Heard it all before.</p>

<p>Every car company will tell you that <em>their</em> car isn&#8217;t just a car. Landrover is the possibility of the open road; BMW is design and performance embodied.</p>

<p>Of course no one&#8217;s convinced that a Landrover &amp; BMW aren&#8217;t really just cars&#8211;cars that do cool stuff, cars that make you feel powerful/authentic/hip/successful but cars nonetheless.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Smart&#8217;s <a href="http://www.smart-urban-stage.com/smart-urban-stage/">Smart Urban Stage</a> project is a world apart. This campaign demonstrates that Smart is indeed a smart car company that is thinking outside the box with four doors.</p>

<p>The Smart Urban Stage project asks experts from around the world to reflect on cities and what they call the &#8220;Urban Status Quo.&#8221; They create a forum where intellectuals from various disciplines can ask luminaries in their fields to respond to questions about the future of urban life.</p>

<p>One example is  trend forecaster Lidewij Edelkoort&#8217;s question about Nationalism. She asks &#8220;How Can We Come Together?&#8221; and invites food stylists and artists to respond. The responses are fascinating but also provide a platform for global artists and intellectuals to profile their work to new audiences.  I also happen to know that Smart remunerates all of the participants for their contributions. Smart.</p>

<p>Here are my reflections of why the Smart Urban Stage project goes further on helping Smart be more than a car:</p>

<ul>
<li>  The campaign is about creating dialogue: Rather than Smart telling you what it thinks about the future of cities it opens the question up to a diverse range of intellectuals, artists and thinkers who do the heavy lifting.</li>
<li>  It positions Smart as a leader. This is an issue that Smart Cars are linked to because smaller cars open up whole new ways of thinking about the urban landscape and about design&#8217;s role in constructing a better future. But, it&#8217;s not a direct link. And, Smart&#8217;s role, while not hidden, is appropriately balanced in relation to other content</li>
<li>  It&#8217;s actually interesting. So often initiatives like this sound interesting in boardrooms but can&#8217;t really compete with all the other cool shit on the web. Fact is, this one can.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do you think this is just another clever car campaign in disguise? Or is this more interesting? Would you participate if they asked you (BTW, I know someone who has been invited to participate and she&#8217;s taking these questions very seriously)</p>
