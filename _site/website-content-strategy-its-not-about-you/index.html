  <h1 class="post-title">Website content strategy: It&#8217;s not about you.</h1>
  <span class="post-date">11 Jun 2011</span>
  <span class="post-author"></span>
  <p>We recently finished a content strategy session with <a href="http://www.planetinfocus.org/">Planet In Focus</a>. We&#8217;re redesigning their site to serve their business goals. Strange as it may sound, it&#8217;s a new approach for them. And they&#8217;re not alone.</p>

<p>Over the last ten years, brands have been faced with a marketing challenge that never existed before: What content should my website have?</p>

<p>Most people&#8217;s knee jerk response to the question is: &#8220;All of it&#8221;. Then they set about a lengthy process of organizing everything they could say about themselves. This approach offers a few challenges off the bat:</p>

<ul>
<li>  It&#8217;s a lot of work, and can often bog down or be an unbearable burden on a web project. Especially since people tend to leave it until the end.</li>
<li>  It can polarize stakeholders who all want to see their piece reflected on the home page</li>
<li>  It doesn&#8217;t leverage the web&#8217;s key benefits over printâ€“the ability to assess people&#8217;s interest level in your content, earning the interest of more qualified leads, relevance in the eyes of search engines, etc</li>
</ul>

<p>A brick and mortar analogy to this approach would be selling your house without &#8216;fluffing&#8217; it. Even if you never baked a day in your life, it&#8217;s worthwhile to pop some apple turnovers in the oven when you&#8217;re having an open house.</p>

<p>The reason is that most people aren&#8217;t interested in you, they&#8217;re interested in how their association with you can help them fulfill <em>their</em> interests. If you can help them picture themselves baking away in their new home, all the better.</p>

<p>Developing web site content that matters to people means starting with why they&#8217;re coming. Who do you honestly expect to come to your site and what are they expecting to find there?</p>

<p>From there, you can cajole them gently down a path towards your goals.</p>
