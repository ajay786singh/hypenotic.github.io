  I promise, this is not a fan-girl blog post.
</h4>

<p>Recently,  I&#8217;ve been expanding my nerd-cred by including a healthy dose of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who">Doctor Who</a> into my life. I have been told for years by Time Lord enthusiasts how <em>amazing</em> this show is. How it will make you a better person by giving you a daily (albiet heavy) dose of catharsis intermingled with hilarity. How the many faces of the Doctor will leave you wondering how you could possibly love the inevitable successor as much as you love the current one gracing your television screen.</p>

<p>Yes, it&#8217;s silly at times, and yes it starts with a pretty low budget. But if you can get past that for the first few episodes you&#8217;re in for a very big treat.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t have as much free time as I&#8217;d like, and since the show started back in the 1960s (amazing, right?), I decided to start with the 10th doctor, who is now one of my creative inspirations, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0855039/bio">David Tennant</a>.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;">
  Again, I promise—not a fan-girl post.
</h4>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Since High School, I&#8217;ve been on the receiving end of friends and family members who are scared to death that they&#8217;re not on the right path. That they&#8217;re never certain that they truly know what they want to be &#8220;when they grow up&#8221; or are terrified that they are just &#8220;wasting time&#8221;, &#8220;making too many mistakes&#8221; or using &#8220;too many quotation marks&#8221;. Our society drills into our heads that by the end of high school we should know what and who we want to be forever unchanging.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I should point out, that I find this completely ridiculous. People should constantly strive to evolve and find new passions, experiences, and hobbies that make them better people, ultimately (hopefully) creating a sustainable and fruitful economy.
</p>

<p>But I digress. Back to David.</p>

<p>David was one of the rare lucky ones who knew exactly what he wanted be when he grew up at a <em>very</em> young age. And by young, I mean about 3 or 4 years old. David wanted to be an actor because he was <em>inspired by his love of the BBC show Doctor Who</em>, then played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0048982/">Tom Baker</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0205749/">Peter Davison.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I was very small, about 3 or 4 I think, and just wanted to be the people on telly telling these wonderful stories. Obviously the idea grew and matured with me but I can&#8217;t ever remember wanting to do anything else. I&#8217;ve just sort of taken it for granted all my life that that was what I would do.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You might be thinking that I&#8217;m contradicting myself. David didn&#8217;t really <em>change</em> what he wanted to do. He had a dream and he followed it through. But David doesn&#8217;t just inspire me because of that extremely awesome fact.  He also points out:</p>

<blockquote>
<p> &#8220;Unlike other enduring characters such as Sherlock Holmes or Tarzan, being the Doctor allows you a certain freedom that is both very demanding and very thrilling.** It allows you to make the character using elements of yourself.**&#8220;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So not only did David find his passion, but he was true to himself while obtaining it.</p>

<p>Maybe we don&#8217;t all know what we want to do when we are toddlers. Maybe we don&#8217;t know what we want to do when we&#8217;re 18. We may not even know what we want to do when we&#8217;re adults. But if there is anything you can take away from The Doctor, its that you should find what you are passionate about—regardless of timing— and bring who you are to the table. You will never make too many mistakes, or be on the wrong path if you are true to who you are and what you love.</p>

<p>Nerd out.</p>
