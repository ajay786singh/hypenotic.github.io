   <id>http://getpoole.com/how-looking-to-rent-in-toronto-can-teach-a-few-lessons-in-marketing</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This weekend my landlord dropped by with a bottle of brandy, and a big apology: He&amp;#8217;s selling the house. Shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our application made it to the top of the pile on this place primarily because both my husband and the landlord speak Russian. What are the odds of that happening again. And then I realized- if connection got us a great place once, maybe its a plan we can use again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I picked my favourite house on the block, that one with all the windows and rooftop patio, and dropped a hand written note in their mailbox. The note was pretty much a plea to poach their house if they happened to be moving anytime soon. Long shot, I know. But the next day, I got a call. She wasn&amp;#8217;t moving, but her sister was. And the day after that, I got an email from her sister. Her place was out of my budget, but she&amp;#8217;d pass on my note. Before I knew it, I had started a paper version of social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sparked some big ideas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t under-estimate the power of common ground&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had an idea to talk to one person, and it led to a bigger opportunity to talk to a community. It got me thinking, what makes some ideas turn into opportunities, and others not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I stumbled across the artist statement of &lt;a href=&quot;http://gapingvoid.com/so/#sthash.afYaUw51.dpuf&quot;&gt;Hugh MacLeod&lt;/a&gt;, and found an answer to this question. MacLeod defines opportunity as a thing that happens when common ground meets something worth sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thats when I understood why my experiment worked:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The common ground: How hard it is to find a good place to live in Toronto. It&amp;#8217;s a subject that everyone can speak on, as an expert, with passion. That&amp;#8217;s huge potential for many conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The something worth sharing: Advice. Potential referral. A story to share. A lead. Good Karma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This combining common ground with something worth sharing is a recipe for making things happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A process based on feedback leads to success&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the first letter didn&amp;#8217;t work, I got connected with someone else. Who might pass me on to another opportunity. And along the way, I&amp;#8217;ve been getting feedback from the people who&amp;#8217;ve picked up on my paper trail. Here&amp;#8217;s an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Jen just wrote me a very sweet note and is trying to poach my apartment. I give her full credit and a big high five for putting out there, but I am not leaving this pop-stand. I told Jen that (so and so) is leaving her place on (street name), and that she may want to see it. Discuss.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feedback + experiment + feedback + experiment leads to better decision making, and helps you remain focused on finding the best solution before investing a lot of time into it. (Like, say, committing to a year lease.) If this model applied to apartment renting, and tenants referred tenants, the experience would be better for both tenants and landlords. Renters could start looking for an apartment months in advance, instead scouring posts 1 week before moving day from landlords. A backdoor approach to apartment hunting would promote transparency. This might get landlords to focus more on up-keeping the property. And landlords might start a better relationship with tenants because they were referred. Referrals = trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Start small&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This letter is working at the smallest scale. And the feedback I&amp;#8217;m getting is encouraging me to continue growing the project. How often do we abandon great ideas because factors such as work, cost, and duration, get in the way? I&amp;#8217;ve learned that starting with the absolute minimal viable product (MVP) of an idea is more sustainable. It&amp;#8217;s a sure way to start making change and seeing results with the least amount of investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on what I&amp;#8217;ve learned from this experience, I want to expand this experiment to phase 2. It might end up being a blog forum, social media group, or a website. But in the meantime, my minimum viable product is to start a movement and keep learning and collecting followers along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help me this project get rolling, and help me find a place by passing this on &lt;img src=&quot;http://hypelabs.ca/hypenotic/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif&quot; alt=&quot;:)&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jen and her husband seek a 1-2 bedroom, for July 1st or later. We would like some kind of outdoor escape (patio or yard), and lots of light. Preferably located in the west end. We have a nice cat. We have amazing day jobs that we&amp;#8217;re pretty passionate about, but we&amp;#8217;re artists on nights and weekends. This means we are going to re-paint the place with an incredible colour palette, and have references to prove it. We&amp;#8217;re looking to spend up to 1700$ a month for the right place. If this sounds like something you know might be soon available, connect with us at jenandgleb@gmail.com. If not, we&amp;#8217;d appreciate your passing this note on to someone who might. Thanks for changing the Toronto apartment hunting experience!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Go Home Lake: Ontario Lakes Project</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/go-home-lake-ontario-lakes-project/"/>
   <updated>2014-01-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/go-home-lake-ontario-lakes-project</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/gohomelakeprintweb.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-12454&quot; alt=&quot;gohomelakeprintweb&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/gohomelakeprintweb.png&quot; width=&quot;808&quot; height=&quot;424&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;The Lake You Can&amp;#8217;t Wait To Leave&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;Go Home Lake, in the tow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;nship of Georgian Bay, is situated in a hot spot of other lakes and islands with equally simple and informative names. There’s Paradise Bay to the north. Bay Of Many Winds lies to the south, Black Squirrel Island to the west, and the list goes on and on (check out a map &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5em;&quot; href=&quot;https://maps.google.ca/maps?q=go+home+lake+ontario&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x4d2afb5a2754ee03:0x132e9d9bca11bb22,Go+Home+Lake&amp;gl=ca&amp;ei=FrTFUqyjAqTk2AW374DQBA&amp;ved=0CKkBELYD&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These names made me wonder whether they were named for obvious reasons. Turns out, Go Home Lake got its name from the loggers that would ‘go home’ after a long, hard day of sending timber down a connecting river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wanting to leave a lake reminded me of a recent experience crashing at a friends lakeside cottage with 16 other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For those reading who were also there, I had a wonderful time, and being ready to go on the last day should be no reflection of the awesomeness we shared.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I’m sure we can all relate, that after a few days of 16 people sharing 6 bedrooms and 1 kitchen, and -30 weather holding introverts hostage in indoors with extroverts, the feeling of going home can sometimes be better than the feeling of going to a lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what are the odds there is a story on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thespec.com/opinion-story/2115985-it-s-called-go-home-lake-for-a-reason/&quot;&gt;Onion&lt;/a&gt; with this exact theme. I had to share, its a funny and truthful read. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Its Called Go Home Lake for a Reason&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/em&gt;By Paul Benedetti
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were lucky enough to do quite a bit of “cottage surfing” this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cottage surfing is a lot like what young people call “couch surfing.” Basically, couch surfing is serially crashing at your friends’ apartments while you pretend to try to find your own accommodations. There are stories of students doing this throughout their university years, eventually graduating and buying a house with all the rent money they saved by mooching off their friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cottage surfing is similar except the beds are better and there’s a lot less hair gel and beer pong. Essentially, adult cottage surfing was designed by people who want to enjoy the delights of Canada’s wilderness but are too smart to own their own cottage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We visited many friends over the summer season in places like Honey Harbour, Lake Rosseau, Barrie’s Bay and the Thousand Islands. All in all, our trips went very well, if you can overlook one small misunderstanding with local law enforcement over some nude wakeboarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(You’re not nude if you’re wearing a hat right?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I say our visits went well, it’s only because we have learned to carefully watch for signs that we have overstayed our welcome. It’s pretty tricky stuff. For one thing, it’s hard to catch the nuances of what people are saying to you if you’ve been drinking beers since noon. As well, even without the haze created by a half-dozen Bud Limes, sometimes hosts are not as clear as they should be about the nature of the holiday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, these Why-don’t-you-come-up-and-stay-for-a-while?-style invitations can be problematic. Does that mean a day or two? A long weekend or are we talking a week? It’s hard to know. Hard to know regardless whether you are a visitor or the host. We’ve had problems on both sides of that equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, we’ve invited people out for a Friday night dinner and sleepover so no one has to worry about driving. Most people enjoy breakfast on Saturday and then spend a few hours chatting before hitting the road. A couple of times though, as we got in our car on Sunday evening to head back to the city from our cottage on Lake Erie, we’ve had people standing on OUR porch waving goodbye, calling out, “Don’t worry, we’ll lock up when we leave.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also been on the other end of that scenario, extending my visit by a day and then another and another until I realize one evening that everyone else has left and dinners now consist of the host couple, their aging mother Ethel — and me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awkward moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, there are warning signs that you may be heading into Cottage Visiting Overload. You know it’s time to go when:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• At the breakfast table you start talking about “your room” in the cottage, as in: “You know, I’d like to change the curtains in my room. Maybe something in lime green.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• You sleep in one morning only to find your duffel bag packed and sitting on the end of the dock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• You stopped bothering “getting dressed” and just lounge around the cabin unshaven in your bathrobe and bifocals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Your hosts have left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• You’ve cooked the three things you know how to make. Twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• You’ve told the three good jokes you know. Twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• The little kids start calling you “Uncle.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• All the other guests have departed. Your hosts mention that they are celebrating their 30th wedding anniversary with a “romantic week” at the cottage. You offer to buy some candles and bake a nice cake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• You go into your room one night and find a map of Ontario open on your bed with a huge red magic marker line from the cottage back to Hamilton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t worry if you are embarrassed that you missed some of these signs. (Who among us has not, I ask you?) These are actually quite subtle compared to being escorted down to the boat at dawn and left at the local dock in the rain. Not that that ever happened to me. Well, at least not within the last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funny, I haven’t received any cottage invitations for Thanksgiving. What’s up with that?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Kitchen Party approach to Web Design &#038; Dev</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/the-kitchen-party-approach-to-web-design-dev/"/>
   <updated>2014-01-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/the-kitchen-party-approach-to-web-design-dev</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We have people over for dinner often. Invariably, my wife asks me to please prepare in advance as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She doesn&amp;#8217;t like the mayhem of preparation–at least four adults standing in the kitchen, some preparing, some just sipping, with kids occasionally nipping through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do. I mean, I can put out some snackables and get some beverages ready for when guests show up, and maybe prepare things that need to be measured in advance. But I like cooking &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figure just about everyone gets into the vibe of a kitchen party, most people enjoy cooking together and even people who don&amp;#8217;t habitually enjoy it mind it less at other&amp;#8217;s people&amp;#8217;s houses. I&amp;#8217;d go so far as to say that what really bothers my wife is the anticipation of mayhem that either never comes or is enjoyable if it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This version of our website is like one of my dinner parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve got most of the heavy features and enough key content in place, but we&amp;#8217;ve invited people into the kitchen before it&amp;#8217;s done. If we waited until it was perfect, we&amp;#8217;d never launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And like the kitchen party, the mayhem doesn&amp;#8217;t feel that bad. In fact, it&amp;#8217;s helping us feel the parts that need attention acutely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach is also a testament to our belief that software is never actually &amp;#8216;finished&amp;#8217;. &amp;#8216;Finished&amp;#8217; is a mythical state that misses the point and opportunity (inherent in the digital context) to always be learning from, iterating on and maximizing your returns from your website. Rather, your website is simply in whatever state of being able to solve your user&amp;#8217;s needs and business goals that it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This version&lt;/em&gt; is an improvement in the state of our last one because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;The code is leaner:&lt;/strong&gt; Google&amp;#8217;s page speed rank has gone from red to yellow and is on it&amp;#8217;s way to green &lt;strong&gt;[Update: It&amp;#39;s now &lt;span style=&quot;color: #008000;&quot;&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;–&lt;a title=&quot;Hypenotic Google Page Speed Link&quot; href=&quot;http://hypn.tc/1eswXcm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;85/100 for Mobile and 95/100 for Desktop&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#8217;s responsive:&lt;/strong&gt; Like most people, about 30% of our traffic comes from mobile operating systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;The Content is leaner:&lt;/strong&gt; We&amp;#8217;ve pared down the content with specific audiences in mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the messy live action kitchen, there are plenty of kinks to work out. But we&amp;#8217;re going to work them out live. Together. And keep you in the loop. Welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What it Means to Beta Test</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/what-it-means-to-beta-test-2/"/>
   <updated>2013-12-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/what-it-means-to-beta-test-2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ArcticPlanet.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-12139&quot; alt=&quot;ArcticPlanet&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ArcticPlanet.png&quot; width=&quot;864&quot; height=&quot;486&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, indie-game studio &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chucklefish.org/&quot;&gt;Chucklefish&lt;/a&gt; released the Beta version of their first project—an extraterrestrial sandbox adventure game called &lt;a href=&quot;http://playstarbound.com/&quot;&gt;Starbound&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Starbound, you take on the role of a character who’s just fled from their home planet, only to crash-land on another. From there you’ll embark on a quest to survive, discover, explore and fight your way across an infinite universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#8217;t a game review post—although the game is excellent and if you or someone you know likes sandbox casual games, then you should &lt;a href=&quot;http://playstarbound.com/store/&quot;&gt;buy it here&lt;/a&gt;, and my apologies to your friends and family who will probably not hear from you for hours at a time due to how awesome it is&amp;#8230;but I digress—this blog post is bringing to light the importance of Beta testing and how it applies not only to video games, but also software and websites in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;So, What is Beta Testing?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally Alpha testing is done internally where most of the bugs are fixed, and Beta is open to either a small group of participants, or like Starbound&amp;#8217;s scenario, open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You then take your product (game, website, software, etc) and you place it in its &amp;#8220;real environment&amp;#8221; to gain added insight and quality testing from your customers, clients, and audience before final launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a participant in a beta test for a video game, it is your job to play the game while thinking critically about the experiences you are having so that you can provide useful feedback, criticism, and suggestions to the developers. In a sense, you&amp;#8217;re there to help make the experience better. If you notice a bug or two along the way, that&amp;#8217;s something you can flag as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One developer on Starbound&amp;#8217;s forum puts it best:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we have an early beta drop to a client, we want to hear ALL of their feedback. Tell me what you love, tell me what you hate, tell me everything you&amp;#8217;re thinking about the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I develop business software, but it&amp;#8217;s no different for games. I want the client to tell me about the UI, about the install procedure, about the user experience in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want the client to comment even on things that aren&amp;#8217;t done, or that I don&amp;#8217;t intend to change. Why? Because &lt;strong&gt;beta is absolutely the best time to make changes to a design that&amp;#8217;s intended to reach a wide audience&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a user gives feedback, the developing team can decide what to do with that feedback. They may decide that your feedback is good, and make a change. Or they may decide your feedback is bad, or that there&amp;#8217;s a technical limitation you&amp;#8217;re not aware of, or that implementing your idea is too difficult or out of scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By working closely with beta testers, developers can confirm whether their product is meeting the user needs. It&amp;#8217;s a great way to test that you&amp;#8217;re not making people think too much, or search too long to find what they are looking for. Essentially, you are making sure that you&amp;#8217;ve solved the right problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Social media is a tactic, not a strategy</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/social-media-is-a-tactic-not-a-strategy/"/>
   <updated>2013-11-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/social-media-is-a-tactic-not-a-strategy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I spoke to a class of dynamic Imagination Catalysts (entrepreneur/inventors) at OCAD yesterday. I was there to talk about social media, but as usual, I needed to contextualize it in it&amp;#8217;s marketing strategy role. I remembered one of the more important lessons I learned early on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tools become useful when you have a problem to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the pressure to &amp;#8216;be on social media&amp;#8217; is overwhelming. No less because many have made a career out of teaching people to use twitter, etc&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels like a career in using a screwdriver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was an early adopter and have done oodles of experimenting, but I was most successful when I was passionate about what I was working on and these platforms solved a problem for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a mission, doing research, seeking advice, building a team–social net-working platforms help you connect with like-minded peers all over the world with common interests. Sometimes, they&amp;#8217;re great dis-intermediators and give you access to people who&amp;#8217;s work you admire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But until you figure out who should care about your product and why, it&amp;#8217;s hard to know what you should be sharing, looking for and discussing in these spaces. Without focus, you don&amp;#8217;t know what to measure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may accrue many followers, but you don&amp;#8217;t know if they&amp;#8217;re the right ones. And you risk wasting either your time, your resources or your money–important concerns for any business, but critical concerns for an entrepreneur, SME or non-profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resist the urge to create more hamster wheels. They&amp;#8217;ll only make you feel worse. Instead, follow this path:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Figure out why anyone should care about what you&amp;#8217;re doing
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Make a list of who those people are, on an interest level
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Start listening to their conversations
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Participate in a useful way to establish your credibility
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Finally, lead by creating ways for the people who could are about your mission to take part
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you follow this process, you&amp;#8217;ll find the various social networks are a boon. You&amp;#8217;ll be grateful that they offer the platform, audiences, conversations and tools you need to move forward your agenda instead of stressed out that you need to master a new tool.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/gibsonwebbg.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-11512 aligncenter&quot; alt=&quot;gibsonwebbg&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/gibsonwebbg-580x789.jpg&quot; width=&quot;464&quot; height=&quot;631&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  Lake Gibson, located in the Niagara Region is home to two historic bridges, one of which is up for demo in 2014. Beaverdam Road Bridge boasts v-lacing, battens and riveted built- up beams, and is ranked a 7 on 10 from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.historicbridges.org/bridges/browser/?bridgebrowser=truss/beaverdams/&quot;&gt;Historic Bridge Organization&lt;/a&gt;. This bridge is to be replaced by &amp;#8216;a mundane structure&amp;#8217; instead of being repaired.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, I wanted to be a bridge architect. I would make models of all kinds of bridges out of spaghetti and glue because they had such fun designs. Reflecting now, those fun designs make so much sense. The act of crossing a bridge is awesome, and bridges should boast something of this in their physical design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However nowadays, new bridges lean towards the ordinary. Has the joy of traversing across river, land, and lake IN THE SKY gotten old? I think not. But if we&amp;#8217;re not going to invest the time to make designs that give thought to usage in more ways then functionality, then we have no business designing. In which case, repairing old bridges seems to be the only good option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deadline to oppose this project passed on Oct 5th, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.niagararegion.ca/news/notices/sep0520132.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; for more information on getting involved!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Burying your car makes sense, right?</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/burying-your-car-makes-sense-right/"/>
   <updated>2013-10-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/burying-your-car-makes-sense-right</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; alt=&quot;article-2425452-1BEA5B2F000005DC-696_634x420&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/article-2425452-1BEA5B2F000005DC-696_634x420-580x384.jpg&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  Inspired by the Pharaohs
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;62-year-old Brazilian businessman Thane Chiquinho Scarpa (aka &amp;#8220;Count Scarpa&amp;#8221;) loved his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bentleymotors.com/models/new_flying_spur/&quot;&gt;Bentley Continental Flying Spur&lt;/a&gt; so much, he announced that he will be burying it so that he can use it in the afterlife, stating:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8216;I decided to do as the Pharaohs: this week I will bury my favourite car, the Bentley here in the home garden! Bury my treasure in my palace!!!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, this stirred up a lot of social media buzz. After only a couple of days, the Bentley&amp;#8217;s funeral had acquired over  5680 likes and more than 6000 shares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People were outraged that Scarpa wasn&amp;#8217;t donating the money or car to charity. Not to mention the fact that they was some serious criticism for his selfishness of putting a car in the ground—somewhere nobody can use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out, it was all a ruse to bring awareness to one of the most selfless acts a person is capable of performing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11489&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2013-10-11 at 10.25.47 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-11-at-10.25.47-AM-580x197.png&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;197&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  &amp;#8220;The biggest waste of the world&amp;#8221;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the day of the burial, Scarpa invited reporters to the back of his mansion so that they could cover the momentous event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as the car was about to go in the ground, he stopped the ceremony and gave this wonderful speech*:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;People were condemning me because I wanted to bury my Bentley, in fact most people bury something a lot more valuable than my car. They bury hearts, livers, lungs, kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is absurd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many people are waiting for a transplant, and you will bury your healthy organs that can save so many lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the biggest waste of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Bentley is worthless compared to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No richness is more valuable than an organ, because nothing is more valuable than a life.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;width: 558px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/lego.png&quot; width=&quot;548&quot; height=&quot;474&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    Lego: xkcd.com/659/
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one publicity stunt that I think was a complete success not only in advertising Organ Donation, but also in pointing out how much value we put on our possessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in becoming an organ donor, you can visit this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.giftoflife.on.ca/en/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, and please pass on the information to those around you.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>LAKE GANANOQUE: ONTARIO LAKES PROJECT</title>

   <updated>2013-10-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/lakeg_web.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-11472&quot; alt=&quot;lakegOUTLINES&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/lakeg_web-580x595.jpg&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;595&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Prehistoric Fish That Got Away&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lake Gananoque is approximately located where 5 forests meet, where the 401 has 4 lanes, and where one prehistoric fish lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many have seen the forests and travelled on the 401, but only man has seen the fish. His name was Jake Brennan. Jake was a famous fishing guide from Gananoque. The fish he caught were the type you stuffed and hung on the wall, because no one would believe you otherwise. The greatest fish that Jake ever caught only gave him a scale to show for it, but people believed his story anyways. Perhaps Jake was just that good of a fisherman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jake was on the water one day, casting his line, when the giant bit. The fish was too strong for him to reel in. Instead Jake hung on to the line, and as the hours passed, he waited for the fish to die. Maybe the fish was waiting for Jake to die too, however in the meantime it worked on an escape plan. The fish extracted itself from the lure, and left just one scale behind. After all the rage and disappointment passed, Jake examined the scale, hoping to find some clue as to who his opponent was. On it was a ring pattern that suggested the fish came from prehistoric times. Jake returned to town to tell his story, and the great fish was named Old Moss Back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Old Moss Back is believed to currently live near the banks of the St. Lawrence River.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information on this legend and for other local tales, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.frontenacarchbiosphere.ca/explore/fab-heritage/myths-and-legends&quot; title=&quot;old moss back&quot;&gt;click here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/fun-stuff/11477/11477/attachment/logohpweb&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-11480&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-11480&quot; alt=&quot;logoh+pweb&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/logoh+pweb.jpg&quot; width=&quot;504&quot; height=&quot;491&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On October 20th, the&lt;a href=&quot;http://my.e2rm.com/TeamPage.aspx?teamID=479860&amp;amp;langPref=en-CA&amp;amp;Referrer=http%3a%2f%2fwww.torontowaterfrontmarathon.com%2fen%2fcharity.htm&quot;&gt; Hypenotic Loves PARC &lt;/a&gt;team will lace up our sneakers, and walk 5K with our friends at &lt;a href=&quot;http://parc.on.ca/&quot;&gt;Parkdale Activity and Recreation Centre (PARC).&lt;/a&gt; PARC is right down the road from our offices and we had the privilege of sitting in on their weekly knitting groups, hockey shinnies and jam sessions when we did research and strategy for them last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5k is not a marathon by any stretch.  But what we came to understand was the journey experienced by a PARC member and how this experience shapes what PARC means to their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was best summed up by PARC staff member Louis who wrote the following about his walk last year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I could not even begin to describe the hardships I have witnessed over the past two decades, what has made the most vivid impression on me is the experience I have had of the almost limitless capacity of the human spirit to endure in the face of incredible, and often incredibly unfair, obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our community often seems to somehow find ways to rise above the wounds of its individual members, as well as the ongoing and profound challenges stemming from poverty, homelessness, disabilities, abuse, trauma, mental health issues and loneliness in order to create this living tissue we call PARC. The web thus woven a little more each day in turn promotes in everyone a shared feeling of safety, purpose and connectedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARC not only helps transform marginalized individuals into members of a community, but they are literally shaping the future of Parkdale by working hard to ensure that Parkdale&amp;#8217;s gentrification doesn&amp;#8217;t leave it&amp;#8217;s past and neighbours behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, 5k it is. We hope you&amp;#8217;ll support us in our walk by &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.e2rm.com/TeamPage.aspx?teamID=479860&amp;amp;langPref=en-CA&amp;amp;Referrer=http%3a%2f%2fwww.torontowaterfrontmarathon.com%2fen%2fcharity.htm&quot;&gt;making a donation to the Hypenotic Loves PARC team. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say it with me now&amp;#8230;Hypenotic Loves PARC!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Can a Burp Change the World?</title>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image From: Yertle the Turtle, Dr. Seuss&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks back, I had the pleasure of attending the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bcorporation.net/2013-champions-retreat&quot;&gt;B Corp Champions Retreat&lt;/a&gt; in Boulder, Colorado. It was a gathering of 250 people from around the world who are proud to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bcorporation.net/&quot;&gt;B Corp certified.&lt;/a&gt; We came together to address how we can advance the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bcorporation.net/&quot;&gt;B Corp movement&lt;/a&gt; by making business as a force for good the* rule*, rather than the exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a conversation about leading a movement, someone in the room made reference to Gandhi&amp;#8217;s term &lt;em&gt;Satyagraha&lt;/em&gt; which they loosely translated into &amp;#8220;Soul Power.&amp;#8221; I immediately jotted the phrase in my book. &amp;#8220;Soul Power.&amp;#8221; Ooh it sounded more like James Brown than Mahatma Gandhi. I had to look this up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out the expression &amp;#8220;Soul Power&amp;#8221; is an English translation of Ghandi&amp;#8217;s term Satyagraha which is a blend of the sanskrit terms &lt;em&gt;Satya&lt;/em&gt; (Truth) and &lt;em&gt;Agraha&lt;/em&gt; (Force). From what I can glean, Ghandi developed the term to express his belief that the world rests on a bedrock of truth that always prevails (in the long run). The way to spread truth is by building human connection thereby awakening the humanity in others. Truth prevails when one resists meeting the opponent&amp;#8217;s violence with violence, and instead transforms others by exposing our common humanity and our common cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay with me now&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I revisited Dr. Seuss&amp;#8217; for a client-project and revisited Seuss&amp;#8217; story Yertle the Turtle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yertle, a cruel turtle-ruler, builds a higher and higher throne by stepping on turtles. As Yertle&amp;#8217;s view grows, so does his empire. Mack, the turtle at the bottom of the pile, is meanwhile being slowly crushed by all of the other turtles. Mack protests:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Your Majesty, please&amp;#8230;I don&amp;#8217;t like to complain,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But down here below, we are feeling great pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know, up on top you are seeing great sights,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But down at the bottom, we too should have rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We turtles can&amp;#8217;t stand it. Our shells will all crack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, we need food. We are starving!&amp;#8221; groaned Mack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end (spoiler alert) Mack topples the king with the simplest act. He &lt;em&gt;burps,&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8220;And his burp shook the throne of the king.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And today the great Yertle, that Marvelous he,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is King of the Mud. That is all he can see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the turtles, of course&amp;#8230;.all the turtles are free&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As turtles and, maybe, all creatures should be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not inconsequential that the simplest act of humanity (well, his amhibianity), a &lt;em&gt;burp&lt;/em&gt;, is what topples the King and his empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth-force of a turtle burp is so powerful that it ends the rule of a debased, cruel leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a B Corp is a burp that can shake the world. Creating a business that doesn&amp;#8217;t harm employees, our community and the environment just makes sense&amp;#8211;on a human level. In Ghandi&amp;#8217;s terms, it rests on a &amp;#8220;bedrock of truth.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B Corps are creating a movement by living these values and building them into the core of our businesses. We believe that by being B Corps, and living these values in our core, we are able to make these ideas spread to even the most debased corporations (well, maybe not Monsanto). In the grand scheme of things, it may be a burp, but it&amp;#8217;s a burp that can change the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a B Corps calls to our inner humanity, to see things not as they currently are (false-reality) but to see things as they must be for us all to continue to live and thrive on this tiny home we call earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re proud to burp the change, and hope all of our clients, suppliers and friends will burp along with us. After all, it worked for Mack.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Loons and Lemonade at Four Mile Lake: Ontario Lakes Project</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/loonilluweb.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-11435 aligncenter&quot; alt=&quot;loonilluweb&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/loonilluweb.png&quot; width=&quot;265&quot; height=&quot;235&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  Loons and Lemonade at Four Mile Lake
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The residents of Four Mile Lake, near the Bobcaygeon, are pretty proud of their lake being home to more than one pair of loons. When loon babies are hatched in this community, you hear about it. However its still rare to see the loons, let alone get close to them, and so what are the odds that a boat would hit one, let alone 2 simultaneously?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shockingly- that’s exactly what happened last August on Four Mile Lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The loss of two 8 week old loon babies was devastating news to the community.  Something had to be done. So 6 year old Avery Spitz had a lemonade stand. Avery promised to give the money she made from the stand to the local Wildlife Sanctuary, and thirsty neighbors poured in. 400$ and an unknown number of lemons later, Avery was local news and a local hero. And when two new baby loons were spotted on the lake later that season, Four Mile Lake residents had happy news to talk about once again.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A lesson in social change from the 2013 B Corp Champions Retreat</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/a-lesson-in-social-change-from-the-2013-b-corp-champions-retreat/"/>
   <updated>2013-09-28T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/a-lesson-in-social-change-from-the-2013-b-corp-champions-retreat</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I love the minutes of my day, helping interesting people solve important problems. I love the hours, defining the conceptual models that inform what we design for these clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But. In the aggregate. At the end of the day. I occasionally wonder whether we&amp;#8217;re making a useful dent. Whether we&amp;#8217;re sufficiently contributing to change.&lt;br&gt;
And the notion that we&amp;#8217;re playing  such a small part can be disheartening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week&amp;#8217;s B Corp retreat pretty much followed the previous year&amp;#8217;s format, with one, perspective altering exception: We were asked to read Dr. Martin Luther King&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Letter from Birmingham City Jail&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know Dr. King&amp;#8217;s oratorial prowess. But reading the letter, one can&amp;#8217;t help but be blown away by the man&amp;#8217;s philosophical, tactical and persuasive writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The letter was penned on scraps of paper and a newspaper margin given to him by a janitor while he was in Jail for &amp;#8216;civil disobedience&amp;#8217;. And it was in response to a public statement by 8 Alabama clergymen urging Dr/ King to stop agitating, and instead let their moderate efforts to create change take their course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;#8217;t read it, or haven&amp;#8217;t read it as an adult, it&amp;#8217;s worth a review to consider several massive ideas. But this post isn&amp;#8217;t about those ideas. Or Dr. King. Or even the B Corp retreat. It&amp;#8217;s about you. And me. I&amp;#8217;ll tell you how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the session where we would discuss the letter, we saw a short video of the discussion model we were about to use. In it, we heard the story of a discussion between President Kennedy and Dr. King.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kennedy congratulated Dr. King on his efforts and said he supported them, but there was one initiative he couldn&amp;#8217;t support, called the &amp;#8220;Children&amp;#8217;s Crusade&amp;#8221;, which saw students in streets, peacefully demonstrating, sitting-in segregated stores and lunch-counters and confronting police, police dogs and firehoses. Kennedy wanted them to stop marching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. King explained that he hadn&amp;#8217;t started the initiative, so he would need to confer with its organizer, a man named James Bevel. When he did, James reportedly said they wouldn&amp;#8217;t stop. In fact, they&amp;#8217;d march all the way to Washington if that was what it would take to bring equality to Alabama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the story, when Dr. King reported back to President Kennedy, there was a long pause before he said &amp;#8220;all right Martin&amp;#8221;, you win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world knows Dr. King from his amazing rhetorical and oratory skills, for his resolve, ending up on the cover of time and for winning a Nobel Peace prize for his efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I took away from the story was the notion that like a chessboard, all players in a conflict are critical. The kids in the street, James Bevel, other civil rights movement leaders with other initiatives, even the white police, politicians and business leaders who clung to their ways at the expense of their humanity were instrumental in bringing the Civil Rights Act into being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find the reminder that we all play a role–that leaders are actors on stage who need everyone to play their part for the performance to come off&amp;#8230;heartening.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>MEET JEN: the new illustra-tern!</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;website&quot; href=&quot;www.j-phelan.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-11406&quot; alt=&quot;264123_10151471117676387_1582026180_n&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/264123_10151471117676387_1582026180_n-580x383.jpg&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;383&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose the best way to get to know someone is through their favorite things. My husband tried to do this when we met, and kept a list of things I said I liked for use at a later date. He soon noticed that the list was very long, and often favorite items contradicted eachother. Like the time I said my favorite breakfast was oatmeal. And the next day my favorite breakfast was pie. He would soon learn that every single thing has potential to my favorite, because I can be very interested in everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here we go, some greatest hits from the list of favorites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My all time favorite superhero&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Robert Henri, author of the Art Spirit. (Also my favorite book/ writer/ guru)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;My favorite ‘sport&lt;/span&gt;’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Dancing! Particularly salsa and ballet&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;My favorite art tool&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Recently purchased 2.5 foot long Davinci paint brush. Very excited to use it after work!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;y favori&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;te breakfast&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;For the past few weeks I’ve been pretty obsessed with my new juicer.&lt;br&gt;
The greenier- brownier the better.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;in the mood for love&quot; href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118694/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My favorite movie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In the Mood for Love, directed by Kar Wai Wong&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My favorite colour&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

   <title>Stuck on email? Basecamp has you covered</title>

   <updated>2013-09-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/stuck-on-email-basecamp-has-you-covered</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re working with Hypenotic on a project, you&amp;#8217;ll likely have encountered &lt;a title=&quot;Basecamp&quot; href=&quot;http://basecamp.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Basecamp&lt;/a&gt;, by 37signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We put all of our projects there because it&amp;#8217;s a great collaborative space for both clients and &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com&quot; title=&quot;Hypenotic Inc.&quot;&gt;Hypenotic&lt;/a&gt; team members to chime in when there are decisions to make and problems to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s also a wonderful central place to hold all the assets on a project, such as pictures, pdfs, and other files, so you don&amp;#8217;t have to perform mind-bending feats of boolean searchery to locate revision 8 (final, I promise.) of your website copy that legal finally approved back in late April (or was it early March?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that said, many clients&amp;#8217; work cultures are so embedded in the inbox that the idea of learning to use a tool other than email to manage project communications is a stretch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happily, Basecamp has you covered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone includes you in a discussion on Basecamp, a notification is sent to your inbox. You need only hit reply to have your two cents added to the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s more, each project has a unique email address, so you can forward emails, share file attachments, start a discussion or create a to-do list in Basecamp, all from the air-conditioned comfort of your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good folks at &lt;a title=&quot;37signals&quot; href=&quot;http://37signals.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;37signals&lt;/a&gt; have created this super-short (1 minute, 1 second) tutorial to show you how to email your content to Basecamp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you&amp;#8217;ll see, it&amp;#8217;s easier and more convenient than drive-through banking (for starters, you don&amp;#8217;t need to remember where you parked your car). And it could be just the thing to bring some sanity back to your project &amp;#8212; &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; having to change your email habit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still need help? Feel free to call us anytime or check out &lt;a title=&quot;Basecamp&#39;s help section&quot; href=&quot;https://basecamp.com/help&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Basecamp&amp;#8217;s help section&lt;/a&gt;, chock full of faq&amp;#8217;s, minute-long videos and guides.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Rebranding the Mutt</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/rebranding-the-mutt/"/>
   <updated>2013-09-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/rebranding-the-mutt</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;How would you like to adopt a &amp;#8220;Chubby-tailed German Dobernauzer&amp;#8221;? Or how about an &amp;#8220;Alaskan Collie Fluffyterrier&amp;#8221;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just two of the fantastic names that canine experts in Costa Rica have given the unique breeds found at the rescue centre &lt;a href=&quot;http://territoriodezaguates.wix.com/cr&quot;&gt;Territorio de Zaguates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This amazing organization can get up to 600 dogs at a time, and while the rise of pups in their care rises, the number of adoptions doesn&amp;#8217;t. The problem? About 94% of the dogs in their care are Mixed Breeds. And while still adorable, when it comes down to choosing a pet, they are &lt;del&gt;branded&lt;/del&gt; considered &amp;#8220;less valuable&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&amp;#8220;What could be of more value, than a dog that because of it&amp;#8217;s mix, is like no other?&amp;#8221;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By deciphering the present breeds in some of the shelter&amp;#8217;s dogs, unique breeds were born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shelter appeared on a well-known television program to showcase these new, unique breeds, hoping to gain some interest in their dogs. Their message: &amp;#8220;When you adopt a Mutt, you adopt a Unique Breed&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results couldn&amp;#8217;t have been better! People are loving the dogs. Just after 45 days of airing their campaign, Adoption rates shot up 1,400%, 100% of the costs of running the shelter are now covered by sponsors, and &lt;del&gt;Mutts&lt;/del&gt; Unique Breeds are now attending dog shows (a place where only pure-breeds were allowed before).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>That&#8217;s a Wrap</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/thats-a-wrap/"/>
   <updated>2013-08-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/thats-a-wrap</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/hypenotians.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-11360&quot; alt=&quot;hypenotians&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/hypenotians.png&quot; width=&quot;576&quot; height=&quot;494&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is it. My last day. It feels like I&amp;#8217;ve just arrived at the other end of warp drive and apart from the lingering confusion of how I got here so fast, I&amp;#8217;m much better for the journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s what I learned on the way:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Stop being scared of bold colours- a lesson I&amp;#8217;ve been trying to get a handle on for 3 years. For the illustrations in one of my final projects, I chose colours based on how much they intimidated me. This unusual dousing stick led to some very rich illustrations, just short of psychedelic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Typography will always have more facets and intricacies than I ever thought was possible. And each detail is worth exploring and savouring. Typeface relationships contain all the nuances of love and hate of human relationships. So don&amp;#8217;t everybody be smashing Didot and Bodoni together. That&amp;#8217;s just too much attitude and too little communication for a relationship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &amp;#8220;You can catch more flies with honey&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;. Something Barry repeats every time a project needs to get done and the situation is getting more tense or frustrating. It&amp;#8217;s true time and time again. Also, as with anything that&amp;#8217;s worth having, it hones patience and increases understanding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design controls the flow of information. It holds a lot of power in shaping and filtering what gets communicated. I live a lot of my life listening to wisdom from fictional characters, but I think this is one all designers should listen to:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;With great power comes great responsibility.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; Uncle Ben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put your design where your life is; promote the principles that create a better society and not the ones that offer the most money.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;strong&gt;Here are some moments that stuck with me:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;*   When Barry said: &amp;amp;#8220;I&amp;amp;#8217;m like your work dad&amp;amp;#8230;&amp;amp;#8221;
*   My second day when Jodi said: &amp;amp;#8220;Jess is my home slice.&amp;amp;#8221;
*   All the times Amanda showed me the ropes.

&amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;text-align: center;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;wp-image-11340 aligncenter&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;words_heart&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/words_heart.png&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;100&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;100&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;text-align: center;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
  This has been a great and productive summer&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; thanks to the amazing team at Hypenotic and their&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;big&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;contagious&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;hearts&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;amp;nbsp;

&amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;text-align: center;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
  I hope we will always be like Helvetica and Garamond.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

   <title>Are You Cliterate?</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/are-you-cliterate/"/>
   <updated>2013-08-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/are-you-cliterate</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are many important public education campaigns aimed at helping people get their head around misunderstood issues. Consider how public awareness campaigns helped shift perceptions of the hazards of second hand smoke or how campaigns like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.refugeeweek.org.uk/&quot;&gt;London&amp;#8217;s Refugee Week&lt;/a&gt; shift perceptions of Refugees from liabilities to assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cliteracy public education campaign wants to bring the female clitoris into the mainstream so that it can be better understood and seen as an organ that is as political as it is sexual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artist &lt;a href=&quot;http://sophiawallace.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;Sophia Wallace&lt;/a&gt; is out to help the world understand the clitoris. She says&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It is a curious dilemma to observe the paradox that on the one hand the female body is the primary metaphor for sexuality, its use saturates advertising, art and the mainstream erotic imaginary. Yet, the clitoris, the true female sexual organ, is virtually invisible.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wallace&amp;#8217;s goal was to help people overcome illiteracy when it comes to what the clitoris is and how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She did this through four brilliant tactics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/11371/are-you-cliterate/attachment/screen-shot-2013-08-30-at-2-59-50-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-11372&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-11372&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2013-08-30 at 2.59.50 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-shot-2013-08-30-at-2.59.50-PM.png&quot; width=&quot;603&quot; height=&quot;465&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;100 Natural Laws of Cliteracy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wallace&amp;#8217;s multimedia art project is a collection of 100 natural laws about the clitoris writ large (10 feet by 13 feet) with the huge, neon word CLITERACY suspended from the ceiling. One such natural law includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clitoris from the Greek Kleinton means little hill. More like a mountain the clitoris is 10X larger than the average person realizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reads&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One surgeon in the world repairs the clitoris in women who have undergone genital mutilation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Street Art:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wallace took her message to the streets, putting up Cliteracy posters all over New York. &amp;#8220;This is an advertising campaign for the clitoris&amp;#8221; she said, adding &amp;#8220;After all, who needs an ad campaign more than the clit?&amp;#8221; Good question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clit Rodeo:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/11371/are-you-cliterate/attachment/screen-shot-2013-08-30-at-3-10-36-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-11373&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-11373&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2013-08-30 at 3.10.36 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-shot-2013-08-30-at-3.10.36-PM.png&quot; width=&quot;542&quot; height=&quot;330&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with another artist Wallace created a giant golden clitoris and debuted it at a summer festival in New York. The public was invited  perform and dance with the giant clitoris for prizes. The sculpture transformed the &amp;#8220;little hill&amp;#8221; into a huge, shiny and inviting three dimensional object that was intended to make the organ less secretive and mysterious than it&amp;#8217;s been perceived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Wallace bringing the clitoris out for public viewing is a highly political act. As she says&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Cliteracy is about not having one&amp;#8217;s body controlled or legislated&amp;#8230;Not having access to the pleasure that is your birthright is a deeply political act.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clit-Wear:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wallace is selling &lt;a href=&quot;http://collect.sophiawallace.com/category/tees&quot;&gt;t-shirts and tank tops on her Tumblr site.&lt;/a&gt; The idea is to bring the word clit into public conversation and change the word from something that is spoken about in hushed tones to something people are willing to think and talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/11371/are-you-cliterate/attachment/screen-shot-2013-08-30-at-3-17-22-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-11374&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-11374&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2013-08-30 at 3.17.22 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-shot-2013-08-30-at-3.17.22-PM.png&quot; width=&quot;494&quot; height=&quot;494&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve ordered one for Barry. So, if you see him rocking out his &amp;#8220;Solid Gold Clit&amp;#8221; tank at a business meeting, please ask him about it and why he&amp;#8217;s proud to support Cliteracy.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Miley and Me: Why We Both Twerk</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/miley-and-me/"/>
   <updated>2013-08-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/miley-and-me</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/branding/11319/miley-and-me/attachment/screen-shot-2013-08-29-at-3-30-26-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-11333&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-11333&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2013-08-29 at 3.30.26 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-shot-2013-08-29-at-3.30.26-PM.png&quot; width=&quot;490&quot; height=&quot;258&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world was in such an uproar about Miley Cyrus&amp;#8217; performance on the VMA&amp;#8217;s that it hit the radar of a 42 year old mom like me who ended up looking up the word Twerking late Tuesday night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between Wikipedia and Youtube I got myself sorted and up to speed on current events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, driving to work, I was pondering how to get enough donations to reach the $2000 benchmark to participate in the Weekend to End Women&amp;#8217;s Cancers. I&amp;#8217;ve done it for four years as part of an awesome team (yeah &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.endcancer.ca/site/TR?pg=team&amp;amp;fr_id=1472&amp;amp;team_id=116471&quot;&gt;Cancer is Crap!&lt;/a&gt;) but things had stalled. The first year I did the Walk, soon after my friend Leanne had died of breast cancer, the money poured in. Four years later, my fundraising efforts were stalling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is when I got the idea. I needed to take a page from crowdfunding campaigns and give something of value to my donors. &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/about-us&quot;&gt;Barry &lt;/a&gt;(Husband and Owner of Hypenotic) donated to &lt;a href=&quot;http://getpebble.com/&quot;&gt;Pebble&lt;/a&gt; and got a watch, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.notfarfromthetree.org/archives/6284&quot;&gt;Not Far From the Tree gave away fruit picks with celebrities like David Miller&lt;/a&gt; and raised over $4000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did I have that would be of value? What would tantalize people to give to Women&amp;#8217;s Cancers? I figured it out! I would Twerk at the finish line and share video of myself Twerking for all to see. I short, I would humiliate myself publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I immediately posted this on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/branding/11319/miley-and-me/attachment/screen-shot-2013-08-29-at-2-40-26-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-11320&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-11320&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2013-08-29 at 2.40.26 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-shot-2013-08-29-at-2.40.26-PM.png&quot; width=&quot;505&quot; height=&quot;374&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s what happened to my donations in 24 hours. I raised all of the money to do the Walk and donate $2000 towards &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theprincessmargaret.ca/en/Pages/Default.aspx&quot;&gt;Princess Margaret&amp;#8217;s &lt;/a&gt;critical work on Women&amp;#8217;s Cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/branding/11319/miley-and-me/attachment/screen-shot-2013-08-29-at-2-42-03-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-11321&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-11321&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2013-08-29 at 2.42.03 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-shot-2013-08-29-at-2.42.03-PM.png&quot; width=&quot;518&quot; height=&quot;185&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the process, I realized that Miley and I have much in common and our reasons for Twerking are much the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please indulge me as I share my thoughts on how Miley and I resorted to Twerking for similar reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We Were Stalled: &lt;/strong&gt;Miley&amp;#8217;s a child star. Her biggest moment was when she was Hannah Montana. Her dad is Billy Ray Cyrus. It&amp;#8217;s not easy to be taken seriously as a singer when you&amp;#8217;ve got those credentials. Like Miley, my fundraising was stalled. Sure, everyone rallied behind me when the walk was fresh news but four years on, I was washed up. Me and Miley needed to do something&amp;#8211;and fast!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We Don&amp;#8217;t Mind Humiliation: &lt;/strong&gt;When you don&amp;#8217;t mind embarrassing yourself the world of possibilities cracks wide open. Seriously. Imagine what would be possible if you could put your ego aside and act like a gigantic fool and not even care? I&amp;#8217;m not saying Miley was out to humiliate herself, but maybe, just maybe, she doesn&amp;#8217;t give a shit what you think.&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mamapop.com/2013/08/miley-cyrus-vmas.html?fb_source=pubv1&quot;&gt; MamaPop&lt;/a&gt; put it best (it&amp;#8217;s long, but really well said).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyrus is 2o years-old. She’s a woman now, like it or not. As an adult female she is entitled to autonomy and agency and creative freedom of expression&amp;#8230;.I did some pretty stupid stuff when I was that age, including painting my bedroom dark purple and stenciling quotes from Shakespeare on the walls. I was, in short, a total fucking idiot so full of myself that I could not see beyond the borders of what appeared on that month’s calendar page, and the vast majority of  my peer acquaintances felt the same. Cyrus gives exactly zero shits about what we think of her MTV appearance, and whether we hate it or not is of little consequence to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this look like someone who minds a little embarrassment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I anticipate that the image of me bending over and shaking my heiny will not be pretty. It will be especially unattractive after I&amp;#8217;ve walked 60K and camped out at the Roger&amp;#8217;s Centre over night. But like Miley, I don&amp;#8217;t give a shit and it&amp;#8217;s extremely liberating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We Needed to Reposition Ourselves in the Marketplace:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miley&amp;#8217;s watching other folks like Rihianna climb the charts. She knows she&amp;#8217;s gotta bring it to be current in a busy, competitive music world. So, she shook her ass and used that spongey finger pointer in nasty, unimaginable ways. And you know what she accomplished?  Check it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/branding/11319/miley-and-me/attachment/screen-shot-2013-08-29-at-3-05-54-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-11323&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-11323&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2013-08-29 at 3.05.54 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-shot-2013-08-29-at-3.05.54-PM.png&quot; width=&quot;455&quot; height=&quot;214&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Miley, I know lots of people are asked for donations for walks, runs, bike rides, etc. I get asked all the time. Truth is sometimes I give, and sometimes I don&amp;#8217;t. I needed to break through the noise and do something different to get some attention. I needed to up the ante. It worked to raise money to fight Women&amp;#8217;s Cancers, and I suspect it will work for Miley too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smilers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, of course big, huge thanks to all who donated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;d like to donate, you can do it here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypotheses on the etymology of Fairy Lake:&lt;br&gt;
The first, and most obvious guess is that the name is an ode to the size of the lake. Fairy Lake is a mere, 1757 acres. Then again, the lake might be named in reference to the nearby town of Muskoka. Just the sort of quaint and friendly place that might set the scene for the beginning of a great fairytale&amp;#8230;probably one that involves a lot of fish. Alright, that one was a little far fetched&amp;#8230;. More farfetched still is the hypothesis that the trails around the lake offer a variety of activities from hiking to cross country skiing and was thus named after the active and sprightly Fairy. Following this somewhat irrational train of thought, maybe the lake was named after a fictional creature wrought by the human imagination because the lake too, was wrought by human hands. I guess we&amp;#8217;ll just have to settle with the hypothesis that the elusive nature of fairies (which must be the reason no one has proven their existence) is the inspiration behind this elusive lake&amp;#8217;s namesake.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why It&#8217;s Impossible to Be Creative Without Play</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/its-impossible-to-be-creative-with-out-play/"/>
   <updated>2013-08-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/its-impossible-to-be-creative-with-out-play</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week we went to Toronto&amp;#8217;s first-ever &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/FigmentTO&quot;&gt;Figment Festival&lt;/a&gt;. Don&amp;#8217;t know what Figment is? It&amp;#8217;s a weekend long, free participatory art event that, in their words is &amp;#8220;designed to promote spontaneous collaboration, active communication and significant fun.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was music, art, theatre, games and&amp;#8230;. my kids playing Aqua Attack!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figment was started by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://burnon.ca/?page_id=122&quot;&gt;Burner community&lt;/a&gt; or folks dedicated bringing to Burning Man&amp;#8217;s philosophy and principles to life in local communities. Burning Man is based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/about_burningman/principles.html#.UhY_tmRAQio&quot;&gt;ten core principles &lt;/a&gt;which include radical inclusion, gifting and decommodification and civic responsibility. The Toronto crew got together to make these principles come to life here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Figment I spent time pondering how little space there is for adult play that includes being silly, engaging our senses and interacting with others in new and creative ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re expected to be creative and innovative in our working lives but the truth is, shy of the occasional ping pong table, there are very few outlets for adult play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By coincidence last week I read my kids a story called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Serious-Farm-Tim-Egan/dp/0618737456&quot;&gt;Serious Farmer &lt;/a&gt;about a farmer who takes his job far too seriously and constantly says things like  “Farmin’ is serious business.”  After several attempts at making Farmer Fred laugh, one day all of the farm animals up and leave the farm discouraged by their inability to crack up Farmer Fred. Finally the image of all of the farm animals running away from home gets Farmer Fred to crack a smirk and that&amp;#8217;s enough of a hopeful sign to get the farm animals to turn-tail and go home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can we learn from Figment and Farmer Fred and the importance of play in our working lives?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#8217;s impossible to innovate without play.&lt;/strong&gt; If your business is rooted in creativity and innovation, you need to invest time in creating an environment that fosters those things. Sitting at a desk will only get people so far. What can you do to get people seriously having a good time to get the creative juices flowing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;No one wants to work for a sourpuss. &lt;/strong&gt;Sure your business is &amp;#8220;serious business&amp;#8221; and pays the bills. But does that mean you have to be serious all the time? How can you foster opportunities to laugh and play more with co-workers both inside the office and out?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#8217;s the unexpected that creates fun. &lt;/strong&gt;It took the sight of farm animals in the woods to crack up Farmer Fred. It took me and my family venturing to an island to throw wet stuffed animals at each other to have a different experience that brought us closer together. What kind of new and unexpected places and activities can you introduce to inspire new ideas?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This play business is serious business if you&amp;#8217;re serious about creating a culture of innovation. What can you be doing to create fun, collaboration, communication and a culture that won&amp;#8217;t have coworkers walking out the door?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>This woman with an unpronounceable name will teach you about marketing &#8211; and fixing stuff</title>

   <id>http://getpoole.com/this-woman-with-an-unpronounceable-name-will-teach-you-about-marketing-and-fixing-stuff</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_11282&quot; style=&quot;width: 450px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-11282&quot; alt=&quot;Jane Ní Dhulchaointigh&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/17.jpg&quot; width=&quot;440&quot; height=&quot;292&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    Jane Ní Dhulchaointigh of Sugru
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I threw out a great pair of shoes once after only a year. Just as the leather uppers were achieving buttery softness, the soles wore right through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, there was no easy way to get them fixed, because they were made from injection moulded rubber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I pitched them in the trash and rued the fact they don’t make things like they used to (as though I could remember when they did).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jane Ní Dhulchaointigh (say that three times fast! Heck, say it once at any speed.) is doing her part to put a stop to this kind of disposable consumerism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Sugru&quot; href=&quot;http://sugru.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Her product, Sugru&lt;/a&gt;, is a malleable substance that hardens into a rubbery compound that is both flexible and durable. In Jane&amp;#8217;s words&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew it needed to be colorful; it needed to be a pleasure to use; it needed to be safe; it needed to stick to lots of different types of materials because most adhesives only stick to one thing; and it had to feel like magic.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;from: &lt;a title=&quot;The Great Discontent&quot; href=&quot;http://thegreatdiscontent.com/jane-ni-dhulchaointigh&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Great Discontent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sugru can be used to adapt, modify, repair and improve the things we lovingly use each day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sugru’s website is &lt;a title=&quot;How people use Sugru&quot; href=&quot;http://sugru.com/gallery&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;chock full of examples&lt;/a&gt; from people all over the world chronicling creative ways they’ve used it to extend the life of the stuff they cherish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way, they’re modelling some marketing lessons we could all learn from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are three examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Share your story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sugru does a great job of &lt;a title=&quot;The story of Sugru&quot; href=&quot;http://sugru.com/story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sharing their story&lt;/a&gt;. Not only what it is and how to use it, but how it came to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of how Sugru went from Jane’s grad school dream to a product used on all 7 continents is the heroic tale of a visionary clinging to her dream despite all odds against its success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t read the story without getting a little misty eyed. And it’s one of many things that makes me want to talk about the product with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have a story to tell?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was there a frustration or epiphany that led to the formation of your service?&lt;br&gt;
Were there regulatory hoops you had to jump through to get your product to market?&lt;br&gt;
Did you have to make an about face in your mission?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may not have overcome such extreme odds as Jane and Sugru. But your story can help people connect to the humanity behind your business, see your product in the context of their own story, and give them something to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Have a mission&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jane started Sugru from a simple (though difficult to realize) mission&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t want to buy new stuff all the time. I want to hack the stuff I already have so it works better for me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The product is much more than something you pull off the shelf, use up and toss away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s part of the hacker’s toolbox. A medium with which to personalize the things you already have. To make them what their creators never imagined they could be (but you can).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This spirit of fixing, adapting and improving makes Sugru something we can all talk about, even if we never buy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because who doesn’t have something that they merely like, but would actually &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; – If only it (fill in the blank)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re trying to change the world, or just improve the quality of someone’s weekend, your offering will resonate with more people if it taps into a larger purpose, mission or universal human experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Invite people to play with you&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sugru has written &lt;a title=&quot;The Fixer&#39;s Manifesto&quot; href=&quot;http://sugru.com/us/blog/the-fixer-s-manifesto&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a fixer’s manifesto&lt;/a&gt;. You can download it as a pdf to print and tack it to your wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also download it as a text file or EPS, so you can ‘fix’ it yourself if you want to. As the website explains…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent ages on it, arguing over what was important and what wasn’t &amp;#8211; crafting, editing and tweaking. But fixing is something people feel strongly about, so we’re pretty sure you won’t agree with all of it, and you’ll want to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Point is, Sugru’s igniting a movement around fixing. And inviting us to participate, share and even shape the discussion within our own communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ve created marketing that others can own. And that spreads the message even further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are not mere marketing ‘tactics’, these are each ways to think about the power of your product – and your marketing – to be transformative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minds, hearts, lives could actually change as a result of interaction with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this kind of value baked-in, there’s no way people will NOT spread the word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is Jane Ní Dhulchaointigh&amp;#8217;s short introduction to Sugru.&lt;/p&gt;

Wa-shai-go-mog means &amp;#8220;clear water&amp;#8221;, a fitting name for the oligotrophic lake that is bait for snorkelers and scuba divers every year.&lt;br&gt;
If you think that&amp;#8217;s interesting, wait until you hear about its past. The lake was allegedly created when a meteor crashed into the earth, leaving a crater now known as Fairbank Lake. How is that for historical impact? And people are still vying for camp sites around its banks today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Listen. No really listen.  The sounds of Eda Lake. It seems aimless really. But isn&amp;#8217;t that the point?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Four Benefits of the Pixar Pitch</title>

   <updated>2013-07-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/the-four-benefits-of-the-pixar-pitch</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/11209/the-four-benefits-of-the-pixar-pitch/attachment/screen-shot-2013-07-18-at-4-28-03-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-11216&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-11216&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2013-07-18 at 4.28.03 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-shot-2013-07-18-at-4.28.03-PM.png&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; height=&quot;316&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Call it Finding Your Nemo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his latest book &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.danpink.com/books/to-sell-is-human&quot;&gt;To Sell is Human&lt;/a&gt;, Dan Pink offers up pitch strategies to take the place of the ubiquitous &amp;#8220;Elevator Pitch.&amp;#8221; The version I like best is what he calls the Pixar Pitch based on what he calls the &amp;#8220;source code&amp;#8221; behind every Pixar film you&amp;#8217;ve ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/11209/the-four-benefits-of-the-pixar-pitch/attachment/screen-shot-2013-07-18-at-2-03-50-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-11210&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-11210&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2013-07-18 at 2.03.50 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-shot-2013-07-18-at-2.03.50-PM.png&quot; width=&quot;583&quot; height=&quot;72&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the code &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266543/&quot;&gt;Finding Nemo&lt;/a&gt; can be retold as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Once upon a time&lt;/em&gt; there was a widowed fish named Marlin, who was extremely protective of his only son, Nemo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Every day&lt;/em&gt;  Marlin warned Nemo of the ocean’s dangers and implored him not to swim far away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;em&gt;One day&lt;/em&gt; in an act of defiance, Nemo ignores his father’s warnings and swims into the open water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Because of that&lt;/em&gt; he is captured by a diver and ends up in the fish tank of a dentist in Sydney. &lt;em id=&quot;__mceDel&quot;&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em id=&quot;__mceDel&quot;&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em id=&quot;__mceDel&quot;&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em id=&quot;__mceDel&quot;&gt;Because of that &lt;/em&gt;Marlin sets off on a journey to recover Nemo, enlisting the help of other sea creatures along the way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Until finally &lt;/em&gt;Marlin and Nemo find each other, reunite and learn that love depends on trust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to give the Pixar formula a whirl on Hypenotic. The results are pretty fantastic. Take a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Once upon a time&lt;/em&gt; there were good organizations, working hard to change how people think and act.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;em id=&quot;__mceDel&quot;&gt;Every day &lt;/em&gt;they would try to talk to people but struggled to break through all of the noise made by those with more money, power and influence who sought personal gain at any cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;em id=&quot;__mceDel&quot;&gt;One day &lt;/em&gt;a company that was good like them gave them the tools they needed to be relevant to more people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Because of that&lt;/em&gt; these good organizations were heard by more people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Because of that&lt;/em&gt; their ideas spread: they became better understood and adopted by people who saw that they too could think and act differently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Until finally&lt;/em&gt; these small changes added up to big systemic shifts that made the world a better place for everyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of good things about using this approach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Using the storytelling format creates a kind of distance that allows the story to reveal itself more clearly. I&amp;#8217;m not talking about myself or my company, I&amp;#8217;m telling you a story with a narrative trajectory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; It forces you to tell the story simply, without all the jargon that usually makes pitches muddy and too complicated to process. Once upon a Time just doesn&amp;#8217;t work with clunky but convenient words like galvanize&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Like all good structures, the Pixar Pitch helps to organize your thoughts in a succinct way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; It&amp;#8217;s fun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try it with your brand and let me know how it goes. I&amp;#8217;d love to collect your attempts here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you get stuck, remember what Dory says: &amp;#8220;Just keep swimming, just keep swimming.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Food Matters: Fiesta Farms&#8217; Apron Strings Initiative</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/food-matters-fiesta-farms-apron-strings-initiative/"/>
   <updated>2013-07-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/food-matters-fiesta-farms-apron-strings-initiative</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Five years ago when we began working with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fiestafarms.ca/&quot;&gt;Fiesta Farms &lt;/a&gt;Hypenotic created a strategic platform based on the core idea that Food Matters for Fiesta Farms&amp;#8217; shoppers. This vision was already being manifested in the store, but our challenge was to make it live online. In short, we wanted to create a website and content that truly reflected all of the reasons Fiesta Farms&amp;#8217; shoppers loved their shopping experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early on Fiesta Farm&amp;#8217;s success was rooted in its commitment to meeting the needs of local shoppers, many of whom were Italian and Portugese. Fiesta was surrounded by other stores that were too big to specialize, so Fiesta focused on giving its Italian and Portugese customers a taste of home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While local and organic foods are now a big and ever-growing part of what makes Fiesta Farms unique, the store hasn&amp;#8217;t forgotten its roots. Fiesta still has a core focus on providing customers with specialty foods that other stores shove into a generic &amp;#8220;International&amp;#8221; aisle. Having a taste of home is about more than putting that special &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nestleusa.com/brands/baking/abuelita&quot;&gt;Mexican hot chocolate&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fiestafarms.ca/1388/food/the-machiavelli&quot;&gt;obscure Italian soda&lt;/a&gt; in your cart, it&amp;#8217;s a way to connect with one&amp;#8217;s past, history, culture and family.  In short, these specialty foods play a special role in demonstrating some of the key reasons food matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past four years we&amp;#8217;ve used Mother&amp;#8217;s and Father&amp;#8217;s Day as an opportunity to celebrate families and their love of food in Fiesta Farms&amp;#8217; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apronstrings.fiestafarms.ca/&quot;&gt;Apron Strings &lt;/a&gt;initiative. The core of the initiative is a video series that focuses in on moms and dads making and sharing a traditional recipe with their family members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year&amp;#8217;s series was a true pleasure to be part of. We met three great families who generously let us into their homes to document their deep connection to food as the stuff of life. We&amp;#8217;re proud to share them with you here.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Could Lake Eugenia have Miraculous Healing Powers? Ontario Lakes Project</title>

   <id>http://getpoole.com/could-lake-eugenia-have-miraculous-healing-powers-ontario-lakes-project</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/lakeEugenia_3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-11202&quot; alt=&quot;lakeEugenia_3&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/lakeEugenia_3-580x384.png&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lake Eugenia, the largest inground lake in Ontario&amp;#8217;s Grey County, owes its name to a woman who had a very special relationship to water. Eugénie de Montijo was married to Napoleon – III and was the last empress of the French and was a Spanish countess. Eugénie believed her son was miraculously cured from a fever after being sprinkled with water from the spring at Massabielle in Lourdes France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eugénie frequently visited the grotto and claimed to be in the grips of a divine power when in its presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grotto of Massabielle, is still visited by more than six million visitors each year who share Eugénie&amp;#8217;s belief in its miraculous healing powers.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Become the owner of your story</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/become-the-owner-of-your-story/"/>
   <updated>2013-07-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/become-the-owner-of-your-story</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-11183&quot; alt=&quot;Meeting&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Meeting-580x569.jpg&quot; width=&quot;348&quot; height=&quot;341&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  Hypenotic&amp;#8217;s take on the Status Meeting
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  I&amp;#8217;m sure many, if not all of you have at some point experienced the &amp;#8220;Status Update&amp;#8221;. They tend to pop up at least once a week, typically on a Monday or Tuesday and almost always after everyone has had their &lt;del&gt;entire pot of&lt;/del&gt; coffee.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  I&amp;#8217;m one of the (possibly few) people who really enjoy status updates. I find that when there are lots of projects on the go, having a meeting to just touch base and see where everyone and everything is at is extremely helpful.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That doesn&amp;#8217;t mean that the process is perfect, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypenotic decided as a team to change things up a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  Shifting from a task based meeting to a story-based one
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  Task based meetings typically involve one person leading, and others following. Someone who has itemized everything goes through the list and asks for updates on where those things are at, adjusting said list accordingly. Sounds pretty helpful, however it also casts a negative light that usually highlights what hasn&amp;#8217;t been done yet, and completely skips over the accomplishments. This makes one person accountable.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  Story-based meetings are more in line with Hypenotic&amp;#8217;s values. Not only are stories much more positive, they also make everyone accountable instead of one person leading them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start off with one person holding &amp;#8220;the conche&amp;#8221; (in this case, a hacky sack). That person has the floor, and goes through the projects they are working on, the status of that project, and the next steps. After everyone has a chance to speak, we then each bring up one thing that we are concerned about and something we are really excited about working on. This gets people thinking about ways to creatively tackle any issues that may have slipped through the cracks, or has been on someone&amp;#8217;s mind for a while. It also ends the meeting on an extremely positive note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  It&amp;#8217;s all about accountability
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;:ub.ma&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;:ub.co&quot;&gt;
    The idea is that the accountability and ownership seeps into the rest of the week because you are the owner of your story. Everyone gets to speak, it&amp;#8217;s more engaging, and people leave feeling like they have a grasp on the tasks at hand, that they have raised their concerns and have been heard. So far, I love it.
  &lt;/div&gt;
  
  &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  
  &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accessible predominantly by train or plane, Esnagi is tucked away from the world and a haven for fish, moose, and other gems of nature&amp;#8211; but mostly fish. Esnagi boasts plentiful and trophy-sized walleye and pike for the enjoyment of recreational anglers. Testimonials of great fishing trips and annual treks to this favourite spot seem to be as plentiful as the fish in the lake about which they are written. Lodges at Esnagi Lake adhere to the principles that guide fish-lovers in the conservation of fish as well as the fun of fishing, creating a sustainable and  enjoyable environment. That&amp;#8217;s some great nature-lovin&amp;#8217;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1960&amp;#8242;s Lake Erie was known as “North America’s Dead Sea.&amp;#8221; Then it became an environmental success story. And now it&amp;#8217;s in trouble again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/15/science/earth/algae-blooms-threaten-lake-erie.html?pagewanted=all&quot;&gt;New York Times article,&lt;/a&gt; an environmental scientist said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’ve seen this lake go from the poster child for pollution problems to the best example in the world of ecosystem recovery. Now it’s headed back again.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A harbour master at Erieau, a sleepy cottage town of Port Glasgow reported bumping into a “sea of algae” that he could smell before he saw it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A visitor to Wheatly Ontario stopped to capture the green water , repeating the refrain &amp;#8220;that water is green, pea soup green.&amp;#8221; Indeed it is.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Neil Gaiman&#8217;s &#8220;A Calendar of Tales&#8221;</title>

&lt;p&gt;As you may already know from my &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/fun-stuff/9710/damn-good-advice-make-good-art&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, Im a huge fan of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neilgaiman.com/&quot;&gt;Neil Gaiman&lt;/a&gt;. Not only is he a brilliant author, but he&amp;#8217;s also a fascinating and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=ikAb-NYkseI&quot;&gt;inspirational person&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of his most recent projects, is nothing short of exceptional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;On February 4th 2013, Neil Gaiman embarked on a fantastic art project in partnership with &lt;a href=&quot;http://keepmoving.blackberry.com/desktop/en/us/home.html&quot;&gt;BlackBerry&lt;/a&gt; and millions of his fans. He tweeted twelve questions to the world, one for each month of the year. From the tens of thousands of responses he received,  Neil picked his favourite answers and wrote twelve short stories inspired by them.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;width: 381px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://acalendaroftales.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;January&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2013-06-07 at 11.14.50 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-07-at-11.14.50-AM-580x338.png&quot; width=&quot;371&quot; height=&quot;216&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    @neilhimself asked: “Why is January so dangerous?”&lt;br /&gt;@zyblonius replied: “Because an aging veteran just retired, to be replaced by a dangerously unqualified youth, no more than a babe in arms.”
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equipped with twelve brand new stories, Neil reached out to his fans so that they might collaborate on his new project. The result? Thousands upon thousands of fans submitted a staggering collection of beautiful illustrations and videos to help create an incredible mix of words and images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &amp;#8220;Good fiction unites us, and this project is no exception&amp;#8221;.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love collaborative, multidiscipline projects. Artwork aside, the website itself is stunning from a UX approach. You&amp;#8217;ve got total freedom to explore the entire series by downloading the stories or listening to them, as well as viewing the artwork and watching the videos that fans have created. I guess the only thing I don&amp;#8217;t love, is that its also a bit of a plug for Blackberry&amp;#8230;but I can put that aside. Once you enter the calendar, you only have to tolerate a small blackberry logo in the top left corner.&lt;/p&gt;

    @neilhimself asked: “What&amp;#8217;s the strangest thing that ever happened to you in February?”&lt;br /&gt;@TheAstralGypsy replied: “Met a girl on beach, searching for her grandma&amp;#8217;s pendant, lost 50 years ago. I had it, found previous Feb.”
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you go through the months, the background animates to better reflect that time of the year. So while January is a bit gloomy, May has flowers beginning to appear on the trees and float in the brighter sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Styles vary from photography, mixed medium, painting, and illustration. All unique, and all amazing. I highly recommend you &lt;a href=&quot;http://acalendaroftales.com/&quot;&gt;check it out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Branding helps children overcome their fear of Cancer. Superhero style.</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/branding-helps-children-overcome-their-fear-of-cancer-superhero-style/"/>
   <updated>2013-06-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/branding-helps-children-overcome-their-fear-of-cancer-superhero-style</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Cancer has touched everyone&amp;#8217;s lives in some form or another. And while every story is heartbreaking, when you hear about a child going through it, there are no words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to understand the details of a strategic plan with the use of chemotherapy to an adult, let alone a child, can be an extremely daunting and scary task. Knowing this, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.accamargo.org.br/english/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A.C. Camargo Cancer Center&lt;/a&gt; in São Paulo, Brazil, has come up with an amazing plan to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partnering up with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jwt.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;JWT&lt;/a&gt; and their client, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.warnerbros.com/&quot;&gt;Warner Brothers&lt;/a&gt;, this cancer ward has brought on Batman, Superman, the Green Lantern, and Wonder Woman to help children overcome their fears with a superhero&amp;#8217;s strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_11110&quot; style=&quot;width: 590px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11110&quot; alt=&quot;KrqrvFX&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/KrqrvFX-580x254.jpg&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;254&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    Chemotherapy has been rebranded as &amp;#8220;Superformula.&amp;#8221;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Superformula&lt;/em&gt; to the Rescue
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  Instead of a typical IV bag, each child gets a unique case that holds their &lt;em&gt;Superformula&lt;/em&gt;. They&amp;#8217;re told that the medicine is in fact giving them super powers so that they can be happy and healthy again.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  Labeling Cancer as a villan that needs to be overcome is a lot less scary than being told that you&amp;#8217;re sick.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_11111&quot; style=&quot;width: 513px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-11111&quot; alt=&quot;sJw1sNN&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/sJw1sNN.png&quot; width=&quot;503&quot; height=&quot;317&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    The entire ward has been rebranded to help children relate better to their surroundings.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  Be your favorite Superhero
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  Along with the &lt;em&gt;Superformula, &lt;/em&gt;Artists working with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dccomics.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DC Comics&lt;/a&gt; are creating custom comic books and animations in which the superheros go through a similar experience to that of a child with cancer. They even recover their strength thanks to the &lt;i&gt;Superformula&lt;/i&gt;, which looks identical to the pack the child is using.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11117&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2013-06-07 at 3.44.19 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-07-at-3.44.19-PM-580x312.png&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;312&quot; /&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11118&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2013-06-07 at 3.44.03 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-07-at-3.44.03-PM-580x315.png&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; /&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11114&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2013-06-07 at 3.55.36 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-07-at-3.55.36-PM-580x311.png&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;311&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cancer center’s game room has also been decorated to look like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_of_Justice_(comics)&quot;&gt;Hall of Justice&lt;/a&gt;, where the children’s names are listed as honorary members alongside their favorite Superheros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a design perspective, truly knowing who your audience is and how the solution will benefit them is an extremely important and crucial step in any project. In this scenario, the chosen design solution could not have been a better choice to relate to a child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that more institutions follow in A.C. Camargo Cancer Center&amp;#8217;s footsteps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only now they let folks know via Twitter.  Here&amp;#8217;s the revised version of the above description&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Rob Ford is Gargantuan</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/rob-ford-is-gargantuan/"/>
   <updated>2013-05-31T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/rob-ford-is-gargantuan</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Even if you have been living under a rock, if you live in Toronto, the aftermath of the allegations surrounding Rob Ford and crack cocaine will have burst into your life through some media outlet or another. And while the issue of our mayor using crack cocaine is huge, it is really just the cherry on top of a mountain of misconduct Rob Ford has accumulated since being elected mayor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/robIsGargantua_icecream.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone  wp-image-11041&quot; alt=&quot;robIsGargantua_icecream&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/robIsGargantua_icecream-580x455.png&quot; width=&quot;522&quot; height=&quot;410&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it&amp;#8217;s a difficult mountain to wade through, especially with his massive form trying to hide it from the public (even you aren&amp;#8217;t &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; big, Rob). In lieu of this, we&amp;#8217;ve made an easy to read visual documenting some issues that Rob Ford has dropped the ball on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/robIsGargantua1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-11058&quot; alt=&quot;robIsGargantua&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/robIsGargantua1-580x868.png&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;868&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the controversy surrounding his use of crack cocaine, Ford has consistently shown a disregard for cultural diversity, minority groups, vulnerable people, the economy, the transit system, health care, honesty and integrity, and the law.&lt;br&gt;
Are you for Ford or for Toronto? Let&amp;#8217;s face it, they&amp;#8217;re mutually exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Your Carousel might not be as brilliant as you think.</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/your-carousel-might-not-be-as-brilliant-as-you-think/"/>
   <updated>2013-05-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/your-carousel-might-not-be-as-brilliant-as-you-think</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-11020&quot; alt=&quot;Carousel&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Carousel1-580x625.png&quot; width=&quot;348&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  A well-designed carousel (or slider) is a neat way of showcasing some important bits of information that &lt;del&gt;hopefully&lt;/del&gt; clearly direct you to where you need to go to &amp;#8220;learn more&amp;#8221;. I recently read &lt;a href=&quot;http://econsultancy.com/ca/blog/62715-three-ideas-that-convert-better-than-a-standard-carousel?utm_campaign=blogtweets&amp;utm_content=buffer52bba&amp;utm_medium=socialnetwork&amp;utm_source=twitter&quot;&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://econsultancy.com/ca/blog/authors/blair-keen&quot;&gt;Blair Keen&lt;/a&gt; that discusses whether or not carousels are indeed helping the overal user experience of any given website.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  I do still feel that the integration of a user-friendly, clearly defined carousel has a purpose in some cases, however Keen outlines some very good points for overal usability that we can all learn a thing or two from.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  UX Master &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nngroup.com/people/jakob-nielsen/&quot;&gt;Jakob Nielsen&lt;/a&gt;, and conversion pro &lt;a href=&quot;http://conversionxl.com/about/&quot;&gt;Peep Laja&lt;/a&gt; are among those who believe that the use of an unadulterated carousel says &amp;#8220;We couldn&amp;#8217;t figure out or agree on exactly what you need, so we decided to show you a few options instead&amp;#8221;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  In Keen&amp;#8217;s experience there are three main reasons why carousels find their way into production:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 13px;&quot;&gt;Unsure of the purpose of the page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Having the belief that it doesn&amp;#8217;t matter where the content is displayed so long as it&amp;#8217;s somewhere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Carousels are an out-dated trend that has been left unchallenged for too long.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-10986&quot; alt=&quot;Carousel_comic&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Carousel_comic-580x148.png&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;148&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you take a look at your analytics, you may be surprised to see that the majority of users will click on the first slide and will ignore the rest of the information in your carousel, just because it was presented to them first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This decision-making &amp;#8220;strategy&amp;#8221; attempts to meet an acceptability threshold that is referred to as &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing&quot;&gt;Satisficing&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;. Essentially, this is mashup of the words &lt;em&gt;satisfy,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;suffice&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;sacrifice&lt;/em&gt;. It describes the tendency to select the first option that appears that addresses most needs rather than choose to search for the optimal solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &amp;#8220;What do we do, if not&lt;br /&gt; use a carousel?&amp;#8221; you ask?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Straight off the bat,  you need a clear definition of what the &lt;strong&gt;primary goal&lt;/strong&gt; of the page is. Only then can you make the necessary logical decisions on where information should be displayed and how. What are your users trying to achieve? What path do you want them to take, or rather what path will help them arrive at the answers to their questions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  Upon arriving at your homepage, there will obviously be a lot you want your users to see and do, however a clear specific hierarchy system will help narrow down and prioritize those actions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; alt=&quot;Carousel_comic_2b&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Carousel_comic_2b-580x173.png&quot; width=&quot;464&quot; height=&quot;138&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1em;&quot;&gt;Idea 1: Remove It!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Keen makes a good point stating that &amp;#8220;before optimizing something you should first establish a benchmark of current performance. What contribution does the page or piece of content make to your conversion rate at the moment?&amp;#8221;. He dares you to try removing the carousel altogether. In Keen&amp;#8217;s case, removing a carousel for one of his clients &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;increased sales by 23%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;. In another, it made no change.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  Another bonus to removing the carousel is that it frees up a significant amount of screen real estate. Removing the carousel allows the rest of the content to move up, giving the users more clarity and specific call to actions at a much faster rate.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Idea 2: Try a Targeted Static Banner!&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  Try opting for more specific, targeted content over general. Keen talks about an example of a homepage where &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adobe.com/ca/solutions/testing-targeting.html&quot;&gt;Adobe Target&lt;/a&gt; checks the user&amp;#8217;s cookies to see if they have been on the site before. It then shows a different message and call-to-action if they have, versus if they haven&amp;#8217;t.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Idea 3: Use Specific Imagery (this includes big text)!&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visuals help establish hierarchy and clarity to users who don&amp;#8217;t want to spend too much time browsing for what they are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stated before, I do still feel that there is a time and place for the use of a well-designed, user-friendly carousel** as long as the call-to-actions are clearly defined and visible**. If you feel that yours is taking up far too much screen real-estate, try looking at your analytics to see where people are going. Really think hard about what the users who come to your site to actually want to achieve and keep on testing to find the optimal solution for them to have their best user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Mystery Box Is Inside All Of Us</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/the-mystery-box-is-inside-all-of-us/"/>
   <updated>2013-05-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/the-mystery-box-is-inside-all-of-us</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Blog_magicBox.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-10974&quot; alt=&quot;Blog_magicBox&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Blog_magicBox-580x277.jpg&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;277&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A couple days ago, I was perusing the videos of TEDtalks, hunting for gems of genius, when the awesomeness of J.J. Abrams flew out of a friend&amp;#8217;s Facebook message and smashed into my brain. He came in the form of his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpjVgF5JDq8&quot;&gt;Mystery Box TEDtalk&lt;/a&gt; and here&amp;#8217;s what he taught me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Mystery is more important than knowledge&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, only because, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;mystery is the catalyst for imagination&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Through this, I realized that imagination perpetuates and creates knowledge. Nothing would be discovered without the wonder of mystery setting fire to the imagination. Once we imagine what the solution is, or what the solutions could be, we are on our way to knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Look inside yourself and figure out what&amp;#8217;s inside of you because ultimately the mystery box is inside all of us&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Once again, the solution- the &amp;#8220;magic&amp;#8221;, the knowledge- is inside of us waiting to be lit up by curiosity. Psychologists say that often there is a biological predisposition for mental illness that is triggered by environmental factors. Similarly, we have a predisposition for creativity that is triggered by mystery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; As such, it is only natural to use mystery to motivate and increase creativity/imagination. In the search for answers, we will always stumble upon more questions. Over and over again this happens until we have come up with many solutions and found a million more questions. That may be why it is often the hardest to begin a project or start brainstorming; because you know if you open one door, 25 others will inevitably appear with questions of their own. So how do we face that? How do we face one question knowing that the answer is limitless, and that creativity is limitless?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; We do it by realizing that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;creativity is democratized&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s not 1 vs 1000 000 anymore. Everyone has the resources to implement creativity. Ironically we often don&amp;#8217;t realize what a luxury it is that creativity is affordable, something that Abrams reminds us of. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;No community is best served when only the elite have control&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. So take up your brains, your courage, and your allies, because you have the power to face curiosity and win creativity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The last thing I learned from J.J. Abrams: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t hurt Tom&amp;#8217;s nose&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a lesson I&amp;#8217;m sure we will all appreciate in our daily lives.&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>&#8220;Only cuz I care&#8221;–a letter from my Dr.</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/only-cuz-i-care-a-letter-from-my-dr/"/>
   <updated>2013-05-14T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/only-cuz-i-care-a-letter-from-my-dr</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A close friend (who happens to be a Dr.) sent me an email this morning. I watched it because I care what he thinks. I&amp;#8217;m sharing it because it offers an important marketing lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It got me wondering what it takes to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  get people&amp;#8217;s attention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  get people to act (especially in habit changing situations)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  get people to share important health messages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s well know that &lt;a title=&quot;USA Today Article on why men don&#39;t go to the Dr.&quot; href=&quot;http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/medical/health/medical/menshealth/story/2011/03/Study-Half-of-men-dont-go-to-the-doctor/45453184/1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;men don&amp;#8217;t go to the Dr. &lt;/a&gt;unless they&amp;#8217;re pushed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And men of about any age should enjoy the video, so the chances of it being seen and spread are up there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food for thought:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; What emails do you share to people who trust you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Can your communications compete with this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe the next time you consider what it will take to get a message out, you&amp;#8217;ll make sure that the information is as important, and that the way you do it is equally noteworthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>All is Fair in Caffeine and Foreign Trade</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/all-is-fair-in-caffeine-and-foreign-trade/"/>
   <updated>2013-05-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/all-is-fair-in-caffeine-and-foreign-trade</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/coffee_infographic-05b.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-11074 alignright&quot; alt=&quot;coffee_infographic-05b&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/coffee_infographic-05b-228x1024.png&quot; width=&quot;228&quot; height=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I started drinking coffee in grade 4. Granted, it was watered down with milk and honey, but it was coffee none-the-less. I was an instant addict- just one possible explanation for my 4&amp;#8217;9&amp;#8243; stature. It wasn&amp;#8217;t until seven years later that the concept of fair trade coffee first drifted into my life. Since then it has been a pervasive force, prodding at my conscience from the sidelines of a Second Cup line up or tripping up my order at Starbucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of us, fair trade is that label that turns delicious coffee into delicious coffee that makes you a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; person. Who wouldn&amp;#8217;t mind spending an extra buck [sometimes less!] to wear the good samaritan hat? The thing is, fair trade coffee is about as black and white as coffee itself and it takes a bit of digging to sort through the mud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Mission of Fair Trade&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iied.org/&quot;&gt;IIED&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;#8220;Fair Trade is a trading partnership with aims at sustainable development for excluded and disadvantaged producers&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That involves:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Implementing a floor price for coffee with the intention of receiving market price if the market price exceeds the floor price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Eliminating the &amp;#8220;middle man&amp;#8221; and giving farmers access to importers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Giving farmers a sustainable source of income to weather out bad seasons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Giving farmers access to market information, allowing for getter production planning related to demand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Organizing farmers into coop groups that pool beans to be sold under the fair trade label.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all it seems like a good thing, after all, farmers have enough problems what with the economy and the weather constantly threatening their source of income. Why not create a system that works for coffee lovers and coffee growers. The question is, does it work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debating Fair Trade Coops&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Pro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The advantage of the set minimum price gives farmers price stability which allows for better planning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Part of the coop program allows farmers access to credit at reasonable rates. Without this option, farmers suffering from the volatile coffee market would be subject to borrowing at unreasonable interest rates through other means.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The coop program also gives farmers training in organic production, leading to quality improvement and best practices. This not only improves crops but benefits the environment and leads to reduced soil erosion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Con&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The cost of the fair trade certification is born by producers and it can be expensive to be part of a coop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The FLO certification must be renewed/year at a cost of $500 plus 15 cents per kilogram of coffee sold under FLO conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Superior quality of beans is not always considered in fair trade, therefore, in some cases, farmers have a chance of charging higher prices in the conventional market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is All Fair Trade Equal?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You may have encountered the confusing situation of being presented with multiple fair trade labels and wondered why the forces of good can&amp;#8217;t be more clear about what good is. The biggest controversy in the fair trade label lies between &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.ca/aclk?sa=l&amp;amp;ai=CLIoQFSyRUaqIHKmByQH92oGABrnDj7sDoZvtwlzU3rawCQgAEAFQ_eHT2v3_____AWD9oJmB6AOgAZLijP8DyAEBqgQmT9AtqhHElKrZqeoo7vh45H-e-UNQio9gXi3MYawchWBGMpPtShmAB9adcw&amp;amp;sig=AOD64_36eOL_3z7d5z03K0s4FRJ9z_kNKw&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=fair+trade+usa&amp;amp;ved=0CDYQ0Qw&amp;amp;adurl=http://www.fairtradeusa.org/&quot;&gt;Fair Trade USA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;ved=0CFEQFjAA&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fairtrade.net%2F&amp;amp;ei=BCyRUar1KcHkygH17oHYDA&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNF3hT7HR9bHVujNfzRC7JYAG75osw&amp;amp;sig2=DwhMUjmKgQgHPh_X9hh-sQ&amp;amp;bvm=bv.46340616,d.aWc&quot;&gt;Fair Trade International&lt;/a&gt;. Each organization has created their own rules for the ethics of coffee and here&amp;#8217;s where they differ:&lt;br&gt;
Where Fair Trade International only works with farmers in coops, Fair Trade USA imports from larger, private growers. On the one hand, Fair Trade International seeks to help farmers build a local economy. Conversely, Fair Trade USA maintains the belief that the demand for the fair trade label is increasing and will overwhelm coops.&lt;br&gt;
Another difference lies in their application of the fair trade label. The Fair Trade USA label is used to denote individual ingredients in a product; even if just one ingredient in a group is from fair trade, the Fair Trade USA label can be applied. Meanwhile, Fair Trade International maintains that 20% of the product&amp;#8217;s contents must be fair trade ingredients for their label to apply.&lt;br&gt;
Other certifications include the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4c-coffeeassociation.org/&quot;&gt;4C Association&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.ca/aclk?sa=l&amp;amp;ai=Cj8nQYSyRUd3iHcGByQGs04DgD-asxKgDnrXlnDyq34MXCAAQAVDx4fKqAmD9oJmB6AOgAYbK1OsDyAEBqgQhT9Aym3CtI3ybih7cxhGmRuzw1Bm-DuoRikHiiB9dj4cZgAfitasU&amp;amp;sig=AOD64_2Nrffc33rgp4XqJaZtzbRPcHcReA&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=rainforest+alliance+certified&amp;amp;ved=0CDYQ0Qw&amp;amp;adurl=http://www.rainforest-alliance.org/get-certified&quot;&gt;Rainforest Alliance Certified&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.utzcertified.org/&quot;&gt;UTZ Certified&lt;/a&gt;. Each of which have their own standards of coffee inspection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now don&amp;#8217;t get me wrong, I&amp;#8217;m not saying that fair trade is a bad thing. And heaven forbid I say a word against coffee; the elixir of getting through Monday morning. But I do caution against blindly reaching for a green label. Not all fair trade is the same, not all the money goes to the same place. So make sure you know what you&amp;#8217;re paying into. As for me and my cup, we will support sustainability for growers and the coffee of the future. May we all look forward to many more caffeinated Monday mornings.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Eagle Lake is The World&#8217;s Rhubarb Capital: Ontario Lakes Project</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/eagle-lake-is-the-worlds-rhubarb-capital-ontario-lakes-project/"/>

   <id>http://getpoole.com/eagle-lake-is-the-worlds-rhubarb-capital-ontario-lakes-project</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-10937&quot; alt=&quot;eagleLake_rhubarbCapital (3)&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/eagleLake_rhubarbCapital-3.png&quot; width=&quot;470&quot; height=&quot;223&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
On a signpost entering Eagle lake there reads the moniker &amp;#8220;Rhubarb Capital of Ontario.&amp;#8221; An issue of &lt;a href=&quot;http://cottagelife.com/26574/blogs/rhubarb-rocks-apparently&quot;&gt;Cottage Life&lt;/a&gt; leaves the two visitors to Haliburton pondering, just what is so rhubarb-y about Eagle Lake. They search out the answer only to come up empty handed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; Did they eat rhubarb?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Shauna:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m not sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, Shauna and I went into the Eagle Lake store. I found an employee in the produce section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you have any rhubarb?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Store employee:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m not sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My search also came up mostly fruitless. Someone named Margie responded to a blog post chronicling a &lt;a href=&quot;http://ruthie822.blogspot.ca/2010/06/cross-cultural-rhubarb-my-peeps.html&quot;&gt;Michigan woman&amp;#8217;s personal history of rhubarb&lt;/a&gt; by stating:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/ontario-lakes-project/10916/eagle-lake-is-the-worlds-rhubarb-capital-ontario-lakes-project/attachment/screen-shot-2013-05-09-at-3-02-57-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-10921&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10921&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2013-05-09 at 3.02.57 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Screen-shot-2013-05-09-at-3.02.57-PM.png&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;121&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others have referred to Eagle Lake as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yoursoutdoors.ca/community_accom.php&quot;&gt;Rhubarb Capital of Canada. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s like a fish story without any fish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, rather than quash the mythical connection between Eagle Lake and rhubarb, we want to stoke those flames in hopes that someone, someday will indeed help Eagle Lake live up to it&amp;#8217;s mighty reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All hail Eagle Lake, The World&amp;#8217;s Rhubarb Capital!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why Air Canada Is Losing the Story Wars</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/air-canada/"/>
   <updated>2013-05-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/air-canada</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve watched this video by fellow &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bcorporation.net/&quot;&gt;B Corporation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://freerange.com/&quot;&gt;Free Range Studios &lt;/a&gt;many times. But when I went to their site to send it to a friend yesterday, a Twitter conversation between the studio&amp;#8217;s founder &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jonahsachs&quot;&gt;Jonah Sachs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AirCanada/&quot;&gt;Air Canada&lt;/a&gt; on the Free Range Studio&amp;#8217;s website caught my attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/10900/air-canada/attachment/screen-shot-2013-05-08-at-1-09-55-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-10903&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10903&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2013-05-08 at 1.09.55 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Screen-shot-2013-05-08-at-1.09.55-PM.png&quot; width=&quot;517&quot; height=&quot;415&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I followed the trail to Air Canada&amp;#8217;s responses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/10900/air-canada/attachment/screen-shot-2013-05-08-at-1-11-48-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-10902&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10902&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2013-05-08 at 1.11.48 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Screen-shot-2013-05-08-at-1.11.48-PM.png&quot; width=&quot;534&quot; height=&quot;93&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/10900/air-canada/attachment/screen-shot-2013-05-09-at-11-37-25-am&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-10906&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10906&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2013-05-09 at 11.37.25 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Screen-shot-2013-05-09-at-11.37.25-AM.png&quot; width=&quot;516&quot; height=&quot;108&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In The Story Wars, Free Range Studios breaks all myths down into four key components:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 13px;&quot;&gt;Explanation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Meaning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Story&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Ritual&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a fun, end-of-week exercise, I thought I&amp;#8217;d use Free Range Studio&amp;#8217;s own methodology to make sense of Air Canada&amp;#8217;s myth-making in this Twitter exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 13px;&quot;&gt;Explanation: Air Canada offers a way communicate so we can respond to your flying needs right away&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Meaning: We&amp;#8217;ll improve your flying experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Story: I can connect with a real person who can help me navigate the flying experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Ritual: I can have a better flying experience with Air Canada&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this myth crash lands when Air Canada misses the mark, failing to make the system better for this particularly influential traveller. Sachs complains that he was told to mail his receipt for a hotel stay after an Air Canada delay caused him to miss his flight. He tweets asking what Air Canada can do to help? In return they give him the address to mail the receipt in to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you&amp;#8217;re drowning and calling out for help. The lifeguard responds by saying &amp;#8220;just keep swimming&amp;#8221; instead of throwing you a buoy or swimming out to save you. That&amp;#8217;s what Air Canada effectively did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air Canada&amp;#8217;s  initial offer to help creates a myth that is quickly dispelled. And  what happens when myths are dispelled? According to The Story Wars, citizens become engaged to &amp;#8220;fight the lies of the dark art&amp;#8221; of marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citizens raise their voices to express their ire when brands fail to successfully close the gap between myth and reality (called explanation and ritual in the The Story wars and called brand promise and user experience by marketers). Amplicate shows that &lt;a href=&quot;http://amplicate.com/hate/aircanada&quot;&gt;78% of people on social media hate Air Canada. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is the moral of the story?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; You never know who you&amp;#8217;re pissing off and how much influence they have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Social media presence creates an opportunity to close the gap between explanation and ritual. If that&amp;#8217;s not your objective, why are you employing someone to manage your brand&amp;#8217;s social media account? Why are you hiring employees to serve customers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; And finally, as we all know, Air Canada really does suck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What We Can Learn From The Doctor</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/what-we-can-learn-from-the-doctor/"/>
   <updated>2013-05-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/what-we-can-learn-from-the-doctor</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-10884&quot; alt=&quot;Tardis&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Tardis-580x813.png&quot; width=&quot;348&quot; height=&quot;488&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  I promise, this is not a fan-girl blog post.
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently,  I&amp;#8217;ve been expanding my nerd-cred by including a healthy dose of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who&quot;&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/a&gt; into my life. I have been told for years by Time Lord enthusiasts how &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; this show is. How it will make you a better person by giving you a daily (albiet heavy) dose of catharsis intermingled with hilarity. How the many faces of the Doctor will leave you wondering how you could possibly love the inevitable successor as much as you love the current one gracing your television screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it&amp;#8217;s silly at times, and yes it starts with a pretty low budget. But if you can get past that for the first few episodes you&amp;#8217;re in for a very big treat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t have as much free time as I&amp;#8217;d like, and since the show started back in the 1960s (amazing, right?), I decided to start with the 10th doctor, who is now one of my creative inspirations, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0855039/bio&quot;&gt;David Tennant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  Again, I promise—not a fan-girl post.
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  Since High School, I&amp;#8217;ve been on the receiving end of friends and family members who are scared to death that they&amp;#8217;re not on the right path. That they&amp;#8217;re never certain that they truly know what they want to be &amp;#8220;when they grow up&amp;#8221; or are terrified that they are just &amp;#8220;wasting time&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;making too many mistakes&amp;#8221; or using &amp;#8220;too many quotation marks&amp;#8221;. Our society drills into our heads that by the end of high school we should know what and who we want to be forever unchanging.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  I should point out, that I find this completely ridiculous. People should constantly strive to evolve and find new passions, experiences, and hobbies that make them better people, ultimately (hopefully) creating a sustainable and fruitful economy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I digress. Back to David.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David was one of the rare lucky ones who knew exactly what he wanted be when he grew up at a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; young age. And by young, I mean about 3 or 4 years old. David wanted to be an actor because he was &lt;em&gt;inspired by his love of the BBC show Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt;, then played by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0048982/&quot;&gt;Tom Baker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0205749/&quot;&gt;Peter Davison.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I was very small, about 3 or 4 I think, and just wanted to be the people on telly telling these wonderful stories. Obviously the idea grew and matured with me but I can&amp;#8217;t ever remember wanting to do anything else. I&amp;#8217;ve just sort of taken it for granted all my life that that was what I would do.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be thinking that I&amp;#8217;m contradicting myself. David didn&amp;#8217;t really &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt; what he wanted to do. He had a dream and he followed it through. But David doesn&amp;#8217;t just inspire me because of that extremely awesome fact.  He also points out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &amp;#8220;Unlike other enduring characters such as Sherlock Holmes or Tarzan, being the Doctor allows you a certain freedom that is both very demanding and very thrilling.** It allows you to make the character using elements of yourself.**&amp;#8220;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So not only did David find his passion, but he was true to himself while obtaining it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe we don&amp;#8217;t all know what we want to do when we are toddlers. Maybe we don&amp;#8217;t know what we want to do when we&amp;#8217;re 18. We may not even know what we want to do when we&amp;#8217;re adults. But if there is anything you can take away from The Doctor, its that you should find what you are passionate about—regardless of timing— and bring who you are to the table. You will never make too many mistakes, or be on the wrong path if you are true to who you are and what you love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nerd out.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>ChocoSol: Back to the Bean</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/chocosol-back-to-the-bean/"/>
   <updated>2013-05-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/chocosol-back-to-the-bean</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/img.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-10874&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/img-580x285.png&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;285&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you thought chocolate was just a food? So did I, until I met Michael Sacco of &lt;a href=&quot;http://chocosoltraders.com&quot;&gt;ChocoSol&lt;/a&gt;. Entering the world of ChocoSol was a bit like meeting the family Von Trapp, but replace music with chocolate. The community at ChocoSol is like a family whose ethics, work, and passions all culminate in the celebration of cacao.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s not to say that ChocoSol merely glorifies a nutritious bean, their entire raison d&amp;#8217;être is to bring cacao back to its origins as a &amp;#8220;food of the gods&amp;#8221;. Those origins lie in Mesoamerica, home to Aztecs and Mayans, and the birthplace of the cacao plant. To the indigenous people of Mesoamerica, cacao was valued for its taste as well as its medicinal, divine and aphrodisiac properties. Perhaps there is some wisdom behind Valentines day consumerism. The Aztec Emperor, Montezuma was said to drink the Aztec cacao beverage, xocolatl, 50 times a day from a golden goblet. Such was its power that he is rumoured to have called it,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;the divine drink, which builds up resistance and fights fatigue. A cup of this precious drink permits a man to walk for a whole day without food&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[What Montezuma wanted with 50 days worth of walking energy in one day is beyond me]. Xocolatl was also drunk by the Aztec warriors and used in sacred rituals. The ubiquitous use of the cacao rendered it synonymous with currency; one bean could be traded for one tamale, while a hundred beans were worth a good turkey or a slave -It seems that fair-trade had its own problems in those days. The cacao was a food that propelled and facilitated social interactions through the potlatch; a festival that was marked by material exchange, denoting of social hierarchy, and cultural rituals. Wealth was not measured by the amount of possessions retained. Rather, as cacao was a perishable currency, one&amp;#8217;s wealth was measured by the amount of wealth one could bless others with.  In other words, it was consumerism in reverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since its introduction into Europe, America and Asia, cacao has undergone various transformations from the sweetening of Spain to the decadence of France to the industrialization of Germany, England and the Netherlands.  What was once esteemed as the food of the gods was distilled, extracted, boxed and packaged. Finally, entrapped in a paper prison called product, chocolate was demoted to the marketplace. The people at ChocoSol, affectionately called, the ChocoSolistas, have made it their mission to bring cacao back to its former glory, as a rich food that permeates culture and enriches society. A belief they not only preach but practice as Barry and I both left with some food and wisdom of the gods.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What Arbonne Tells Us About the World of Work</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/arbonne-a-white-mecedes-without-the-corporate-junk-in-the-trunk/"/>
   <updated>2013-05-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/arbonne-a-white-mecedes-without-the-corporate-junk-in-the-trunk</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;About two years ago this new word&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arbonne.com&quot;&gt; &amp;#8220;Arbonne&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;began entering my lexicon. First I heard it occasionally. Now it&amp;#8217;s infiltrated my Facebook page and my social life to the point where it&amp;#8217;s got my full attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came home from an evening enjoying wine and warm weather on the back porch of my neighbour&amp;#8217;s house with a three day trial of Arbonne product. I&amp;#8217;m a cynic, but I figured if so many women are so pumped up about launching direct sales of cream and cosmetics I needed to know more. Three days later, my skin&amp;#8217;s about the same but my thoughts on this phenomenon are certainly clearer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s start with the basic premise that a natural cream or cleanser will transform your skin or your appearance so dramatically that people will stop you on the street. I managed to willingly suspend my belief during the three day trial, but when my forehead wrinkles persisted I shook my head and reminded myself that if it sounds too good to be true, your forehead will still be wrinkly tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the promise of Arbonne is not really about car-stopping, glowing skin. It&amp;#8217;s that by selling Arbonne, and moving up the ladder of success, this product can change your life. Leafing through the catalogue as the serum sunk into my forehead I read the same story highlighted by almost every beautiful Arbonne Independent Consultant featured in the catalogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the catalogue, the women who sell Arbonne are hard working women who bought into the corporate dream only to realize that the stakes were too high. They wanted to be there for their kids and husbands and Arbonne gave them the lifestyles they need to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/10857/arbonne-a-white-mecedes-without-the-corporate-junk-in-the-trunk/attachment/screen-shot-2013-05-04-at-9-13-16-am&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-10858&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-10858&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2013-05-04 at 9.13.16 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Screen-shot-2013-05-04-at-9.13.16-AM.png&quot; width=&quot;509&quot; height=&quot;411&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it say that women like the one featured above have become CPAs, Lawyers and Corporate success stories, only to realize that selling cosmetics (much like their mothers who may have sold Avon or Mary Kay) gives them the balance they need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.law.utoronto.ca/admissions/why-u-t/welcome-university-toronto-faculty-law&quot;&gt;Dean Mayo Moran, &lt;/a&gt;U of T Law School&amp;#8217;s first female Dean and one of the recipients of this year&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ywcatoronto.org/page.asp?pid=59&quot;&gt;YWCA Toronto&amp;#8217;s Women of Distinction Awards&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbc.ca/metromorning/&quot;&gt;spoke on CBC&lt;/a&gt; about how law firms are needing to adapt to meet the needs of women who are leaving the profession in droves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://umanitoba.ca/news/blogs/blog/2013/03/04/businesses-and-workers-both-benefit-from-flexible-schedules/&quot;&gt;recent University of Manitoba survey&lt;/a&gt; found that both women and men report greater happiness when they have the flexibility to attend appointments and look after their kids&amp;#8217; needs. Is it really a revelation that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Parents who work flexible hours are more likely to be satisfied with their work-family balance”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arbonne&amp;#8217;s success among successful women deserves all the attention it gets, but not because we all need some &lt;a href=&quot;https://arbonne.com/shop_online/showitem.asp?ProductId=813&quot;&gt;Re9 Intensive Renewal Serum&lt;/a&gt; to combat the wrinkles forming on our foreheads. The growth of Arbonne, while quite retro in some ways, says a lot about the modern workplace context:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 12.997159004211426px;&quot;&gt;The modern workplace&amp;#8217;s inability to adapt to the needs of the dual income family is making people unhappy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Arbonne is disintermediating the world of work just like kickstarter is disintermediating the world of charity and skype is disintermediating the world of long distance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Women, who are on average lower income earners are flocking to Arbonne because Arbonne is the right thing at the right time (non-evil natural products and a promise of giving women the chance to have the flexibility they need)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Yahoo and Best Buy put out the call for &amp;#8220;all hands on deck&amp;#8221; signalling a death knoll for flexibile work arrangements that take families and the increasing need for dual incomes into account, Arbonne is flourishing because its giving families what they need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah its just the Avon lady reinvented, but this time its not about giving mom a little &amp;#8220;pocket change&amp;#8221; to go to the mall, it&amp;#8217;s about the promise of the white Mercedes to drive the kids to school without all the corporate junk in the trunk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>I&#8217;d Choose the Butter Knife</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/id-choose-the-butter-knife/"/>
   <updated>2013-04-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/id-choose-the-butter-knife</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/01_introduction.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-10852&quot; alt=&quot;01_introduction&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/01_introduction-580x389.png&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;389&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My name is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jess-leung.com&quot;&gt;Jess Leung&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;I am a scientific/technical illustration student at Sheridan College and I will be completing a co-op work term at Hypenotic for the next four months.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I couldn&amp;#8217;t have asked for a better welcome than the, &amp;#8220;Do you want to learn how to use the espresso machine?&amp;#8221; that greeted me as I entered the office this morning. Thus, ushered in by caffeine and an encouraging note from Dorothy (thank you!), I started my co-op at Hypenotic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Illustration?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Visual syntax is innate to the human eye. It is virtually impossible to look at an image without gleaning some modicum of information be it implied or applied. To me, illustration is fueled, not only by the desire to create but the need to communicate clearly, powerfully and meaningfully. Being able to influence people and make a change with just an image is significant. It&amp;#8217;s something I hope to do and constantly improve at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Navigating the Cognitive Railway System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A map to my trains of thought.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &amp;#8220;Would you rather&amp;#8221; is a train that permeates my brain for no explicable reason that I know of. A crowd favourite is: &amp;#8220;would you rather be beheaded with a butter knife or be eaten to death by a turtle, starting at your toes?&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  I &lt;s&gt;kind of&lt;/s&gt; love typography and letterforms. I don&amp;#8217;t like to play favourites but I&amp;#8217;m currently crushing on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.emigre.com/EFfeatureMEoverview.php&quot;&gt;Mr. and Mrs. Eaves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Understanding and improving urban poverty is a big passion of mine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Coffee is the fuel that powers the trains, without which there would surely be a rail accident. If no coffee is available, the trains sometimes run on a backup system of humour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Sometimes I say things that don&amp;#8217;t seem to relate in a linear manner, it simply means the train has switched tracks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Hypenotic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Of all the design firms out there, it&amp;#8217;s not hard to find good or even great design. As a B-Corp design firm, Hypenotic offers something more. All the work here looks to benefit and positively grow society and social construct. Like a creative, super-powered, superhero, Hypenotic is making the world a better place, one design at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  I love superheroes. Especially Batman.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as one can listen without hearing, one can look without seeing. I hope always to see the world and learn all that experience can teach so that I may be a blessing to those around me. I aspire to offer all my efforts and quirkiness to this experience and look forward to receiving the same.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/fun-stuff/10813/one-for-the-road/attachment/hypenotic&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-10814&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-10814&quot; alt=&quot;hypenotic&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hypenotic-580x506.png&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;506&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s hard for me to believe, but four months have flown by and I am already down to my last day &lt;em&gt;chez&lt;/em&gt; Hypenotic.&lt;br&gt;
In about a week&amp;#8217;s time, I will be plunging back headlong into the world of architecture; not without some new trinkets to bring along with me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has definitely been my favourite internship in all my 5 years as a Waterloo student. I haven&amp;#8217;t done much travelling (that is, beyond the reaches of the TTC and the scenic Don Valley Parkway), I didn&amp;#8217;t try new exotic foods (Bavarian butter pretzels are still my favourite), but this semester was memorable because I actually learned a lot in the internship itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This internship helped me break out of the jaded feeling that I came in with. I thought I had a pretty good sense of graphic design and typography before, but boy did I have much to learn! I am now convinced that everyone in the design field needs a typography lesson (or two..?). Knowing how to use type to its full potential really makes a subtle, yet substantial difference. During these few months I felt artsier as a person, more eager to try new things. I picked up painting again, and knitting, and drawing. I took the time to get better at guitar. I felt more inspired, because my 9-to-5 consisted of dwelling on inspiration, on inspiring people in this city. I&amp;#8217;m a quiet person, and I know I don&amp;#8217;t usually say much at the office, but I have been listening in and observing and picking up on things here and there, be it web developing jargon or politics. And of course, hanging out at Hypenotic proved to me that there are many, many things that design can do for good (without just saying so).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, Hypenotic, for making me more excited about design than I ever have been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dorothy, signing out.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How far should foundations go in considering their impact?</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/how-far-should-foundations-go-in-considering-their-impact/"/>
   <updated>2013-04-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/how-far-should-foundations-go-in-considering-their-impact</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recommendation #1 in The Canadian Task Force on Social Finance&amp;#8217;s report &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;http://impactinvesting.marsdd.com/strategic-initiatives/the-canadian-task-force-on-social-finance/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mobilizing Private Capital for Public Good&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; is for foundations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To maximize their impact in fulfilling their mission, Canada’s public and private foundations should invest at least 10% of their capital in mission-related investments (MRI) by 2020 and report annually to the public on their activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This suggestion is more than a brilliant tactic to help foundations strengthen their social impact through their financial decision making. Mission focused investments also allow foundations to avoid investing in products and organizations that are implicated in creating the very challenges their grantees work to address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For (hopefully extreme) example, you want to avoid funding cancer care with grant money made by investing in tobacco. Makes sense right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;&quot;&gt;Decisions matter, whether you&amp;#8217;re acting as an individual or as an organization. It&amp;#8217;s contradictory to care about local food and wear say, Joe Fresh clothing. When you&amp;#8217;re invested in social issues you have to bear the burden of carefully thinking through how all of your choices align (or not) with your values.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your organization is focused on developing community and more resilient local economies, should you hire a design firm that works for big box retailers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your mandate includes environmental concerns, should you work with a PR firm that takes on clients who work for dubious Mega quarry projects?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re addressing obesity, or marketing to children, should you work with an agency that helps a soft drink client?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this thought has occurred to you, the good news is there are &lt;a title=&quot;B Corp page on Mars Centre for Imapact Investing website&quot; href=&quot;http://impactinvesting.marsdd.com/strategic-initiatives/benefit-corporation-b-corp-hub/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;B Corps&lt;/a&gt;, who take the impact of their practices into account. &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;&quot;&gt;BCorp is housed at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;&quot; title=&quot;Mars Centre for Impact In vesting&quot; href=&quot;http://impactinvesting.marsdd.com/&quot;&gt;MaRS&amp;#8217; Centre for Impact Investing&lt;/a&gt; and provides third party validation that organizations are on a mission to deliver value to all stakeholders including employees, the community and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll be much more effective at building a better world with your right hand and left hand working together. &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Drag Lake Mysteries: Ontario Lakes Project</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/drag-lake-mysteries-ontario-lakes-project/"/>
   <updated>2013-04-23T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/drag-lake-mysteries-ontario-lakes-project</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/ontario-lakes-project/10801/drag-lake-mysteries-ontario-lakes-project/attachment/drag-lake-01&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-10805&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-10805&quot; alt=&quot;drag lake-01&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/drag-lake-01-580x332.png&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;332&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Located in the quaint county of Haliburton, Drag Lake is, like many Ontarian lakes, a thriving cottage-country area where one will find clear, crisp water lapping against a rocky bank, a rolling blanket of pines, and loons calling to each other in the foggy distance. Though open fires are prohibited (no marshmallow roasting, sorry), the lake is not short of fun community activities, including husky walks and fishing for lakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a timely article posted by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haliburtonecho.ca/2008/10/28/echo-ghosts-come-out-for-visit&quot;&gt;Haliburton Echo&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago right around Halloween, stories were told of an old family house built by one Sir William Laking in 1917 in which there were numerous ghost sightings over the years. Around the time the house was built, Mr. Laking was mourning his son, Sir John Laking, who worked for Laking Sr. in his lumber business. One day, John set out on Drag Lake to a mill logging camp, never to return. To this day, no one knows why or how he disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haliburtonecho.ca/2012/09/11/history-of-water-logged-axe-a-mystery&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; describes a rotting axe found by divers at the bottom of Drag Lake. Connection? Perhaps (or not).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Let&#8217;s Save Mr. Rogers&#8217; Neighbourhood</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/lets-save-mr-rogers-neighbourhood/"/>
   <updated>2013-04-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/lets-save-mr-rogers-neighbourhood</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a little late to the party because I don&amp;#8217;t own a TV, but I did catch Target&amp;#8217;s new jingle, the theme song to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Rogers%27_Neighborhood&quot;&gt;Mr. Rogers&amp;#8217; Neighbourhood&lt;/a&gt;, on the radio as a celebration of Target&amp;#8217;s arrival in Canada. The brazen disconnect between Target&amp;#8217;s and Mr. Rogers&amp;#8217; view of neighbourliness sent me digging to find out more about the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I&amp;#8217;m coming to this a tad late, many others have already taken the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/03/13/target-canada-mr-rogers-song_n_2866604.html&quot;&gt;opportunity to slam &lt;/a&gt;the licensing of the Mr. Rogers&amp;#8217; theme song. Most of the criticism is based on the fact that Target&amp;#8217;s values are so out of step with Mr. Rogers&amp;#8217; often articulated values &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;&quot;&gt; of kindness and his life-long ethos of never &amp;#8220;selling out&amp;#8221; his kindness to brands who came knocking. Even brands like Burger King who used his likeness in a parody ad were &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&amp;dat=19840509&amp;id=aeYNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=G24DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5599,1936560&quot;&gt;shut down by Fred Rogers himself.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;&quot;&gt;However, I think there&amp;#8217;s a much simpler point to be made about Target&amp;#8217;s use of the Mr. Rogers&amp;#8217; theme song. The contradiction is a plain as the buttons on Mr. Rogers&amp;#8217; cardigan. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boys and girls, please, take a moment to watch and listen along with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Rogers looks straight at all the boys and girls singing &amp;#8220;I have always wanted a neighbour just like you, I&amp;#8217;ve always wanted to live in a neighbourhood with you.&amp;#8221;* You* are his ideal neighbour. He has aspirations for &lt;em&gt;you and *sees&lt;/em&gt; *&lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; as a de facto good neighbour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Target&amp;#8217;s version of the neighbourhood, the ideal neighbour drinks  lemonade served out of a kitchy and convenient dispenser at a community gathering, neighbourly friends help haul a bold red bathtub up some stairs and children gather at the beach to fly colourful kites, all apparently purchased at your local Target store. Boys and girls, let&amp;#8217;s see the colourful, fun and convivial world that Target envisions for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;&quot;&gt;The people in Target&amp;#8217;s welcome video all  congregate. But is that really what happen&amp;#8217;s when Target comes to town? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;&quot;&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s take a moment to reflect on what some of the research says happens to the ethos of neighbourliness when big box stores like Target comes to town. We won&amp;#8217;t talk about local economy or sustainability here (two huge issues in their own right), just plain old neighbourliness. Here&amp;#8217;s what the research says:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 12.997159004211426px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlanticcities.com/neighborhoods/2012/04/big-box-stores-linked-presence-hate-groups/1745/&quot;&gt;The presence of big box stores increases  hate crimes&lt;/a&gt;: A rise in the incidences of hate crimes is linked to big box stores because these stores reduce social cohesion and displace local social leaders in the form of local business owners, etc.. Social alienation is the fuel that fires hatred. I get it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1398946&quot;&gt;Voter turnout drops&lt;/a&gt;: Similarly, when political organizations, and business groups are displaced as downtowns give way to sprawl people are more inclined to be apathetic about their communities are thus less inclined to be  civically engaged and show their engagement at the ballot box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;http://jezebel.com/5901634/big-box-stores-are-ruining-everything-and-filling-us-all-with-hate&quot;&gt;these and other studies show that virtually every single measurable indicator of neighbourliness &lt;/a&gt;from the number of scout groups in a town to a the number of Rotary clubs drop drastically when big box stores come to town.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the good news is that once these football field sized stores are deemed too small, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbc.ca/books/2012/07/why-wal-marts-become-libraries-and-courts-and-civic-centres.html&quot;&gt; the giant stores are reclaimed for civic use, like libraries, community centres. &lt;/a&gt; In her book&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bigboxreuse.com/&quot;&gt; Big Box Reuse,&lt;/a&gt; Julia Christensen explains this is because big box stores often negotiate lease agreements stating that competition can&amp;#8217;t touch the store for 15 years. So, since the town paid for the damned  infrastructure to build the (damned) store in the first place, they&amp;#8217;re in a position to reclaim it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, while Target can&amp;#8217;t wait to meet me, I&amp;#8217;m going to avoid introducing myself to my local big box store anytime soon. Target is neither the kind of  neighbour I want to have nor (more importantly) the kind of neighbour I want to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s wrap this up with Mr. Rogers&amp;#8217; goodbye message for children big and small when he finally ended the show&amp;#8217;s run in 2001. Mr. Rogers still has high aspirations for us kids. Let&amp;#8217;s not let him down.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What a good party can teach you about the food system: The Brewer&#8217;s Plate 2013</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a marketer who works for organizations making systems and sectoral change, I know what it takes to help busy people notice and address big ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Beer.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Craft beer and local sustainable fare to be precise. In a great setting like the CBC Barbara Frum Atrium. Throw in multiple live music live acts, a silent auction and an easy-going crowd and you&amp;#8217;ve got a real shot at introducing people to some important ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Enter: &lt;a title=&quot;Brewer&#39;s Plate Toronto&quot; href=&quot;http://www.brewersplatetoronto.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Brewer&amp;#8217;s Plate 2013&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Celebrating its 6th year this April 17th, attendees will experience one of the most delectable, convivial and entertaining ways to be introduced to a really dynamic part of Ontario&amp;#8217;s food sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;25 Ontario craft beer makers sharing their work paired with a raft of Ontario&amp;#8217;s most creative and conscious chefs and artisans donating their efforts, with proceeds going to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.notfarfromthetree.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Not Far From the Tree&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chefs range from legends like Chris McDonald (&lt;a title=&quot;Cava Restaurant&quot; href=&quot;http://www.cavarestaurant.ca/#home&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cava&lt;/a&gt;) to a certified &lt;a title=&quot;B Corporation&quot; href=&quot;http://www.bcorporation.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;B Corp&lt;/a&gt; social entrepreneur  Chris Klugman (&lt;a title=&quot;Paintbox Bistro&quot; href=&quot;http://www.paintboxbistro.ca/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Paintbox Bistro&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the Artisans include Chocosol, Evelyn&amp;#8217;s crackers, Monforte Dairy, and&amp;#8230;what happens if I drool on my keyboard?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Buy Tickets to the Brewer&#39;s Plate&quot; href=&quot;http://www.brewersplatetoronto.org/buytickets.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;You should come.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To whet your appetite, we&amp;#8217;ve thrown together a poster illustrating the range of craft beers currently being produced by members of the Ontario Craft Brewers®.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/BEER_B2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-10784&quot; alt=&quot;Ontarrio Craft Brewers Illustration&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/BEER_B2-580x773.png&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;773&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ontario&amp;#8217;s burgeoning craft beer industry and hyper-established local sustainable food scene are made up of the kinds of small and medium sized businesses that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Drive our economy (Small and medium sized businesses (like craft breweries) employ 64% of private sector workers in Canada, creating 6.7 million jobs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Build community (local ownership does wonders for local investment)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Hire more local labour, buy more local goods for resale and buy more services from local businesses than global brands/chains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Put in as much as love as they can rather than as little as they can get away with (subjective, but it sure feels true, doesn&amp;#8217;t it?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  And they give back to local charities, like this year&amp;#8217;s Brewer&amp;#8217;s Plate beneficiary, &lt;a title=&quot;Not Far From The Tree&quot; href=&quot;http://www.notfarfromthetree.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Not far From The Tree&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you don&amp;#8217;t need to think about all of that right now. You need to &lt;a title=&quot;Buy tickets for the Brewer&#39;s Plate 2013&quot; href=&quot;http://www.brewersplatetoronto.org/buytickets.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;buy a ticket&lt;/a&gt; for a delectable, convivial and memorable party on April 17th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;ve ever visited Ottawa, chances are that you will recognize this lake. A man-made lake serving as a flooding control device for Rideau Canal, Dow&amp;#8217;s lake is a cultural hub with family-friendly events and activities happening year-round, including canoe and paddleboat rentals, skating on the Rideau, and the famous annual Winterlude and Canadian Tulip Festival. Flanked by the Queen Elizabeth Driveway, a pavilion of restaurants overlooking the water, and Carleton University, Dow&amp;#8217;s Lake makes for a versatile scenic pastime venue.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Dogtooth Lake Wrapped in a Blanket of Pines: Ontario Lakes Project</title>

&lt;p&gt;One of the most marked features of Kenora&amp;#8217;s Dogtooth Lake is the presence of towering pine trees, all of equal height, surround the lake. The trees are the result of a huge fire in 1910 that cracked open pine cones and heat resistant seeds were scattered along the shoreline.  This protective blanket of trees gives the lake a particularly picturesque look, all year long.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/10738/data-stories/attachment/infographics&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-10749&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-10749 aligncenter&quot; alt=&quot;infographics&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/infographics.png&quot; width=&quot;408&quot; height=&quot;283&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite facet of graphic design has always been the art of information graphics. It is the accumulated manifestation of several layers that make it so sophisticated – layers of data fleshed out and graphically analyzed and presented to provide an overview that tells a story. The best part? Just about anything in the world can be taken into process and analyzed, and just about anything can give witness towards understanding the world in which we live. Infographic design brings out the multidisciplinary in you: the scholar, the engineer, the anthropologist, the historian, the writer, the editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In architecture school, we had some experience in infographics serving as the presentation of contextual research informing architectural proposal. In laying out accumulated data in a visually-thoughtful array, one is able to draw trends, patterns, and densities that bring to light certain issues and questions. Design is a responsive art, after all: good design is the efficient resolving of a presented issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infographics can range from whimsical posters of &lt;a href=&quot;http://popchartlab.com/collections/prints/products/the-beatles-song-chart-volume-1&quot;&gt;Beatles songs&lt;/a&gt; to sobering &lt;a href=&quot;http://kellianderson.com/blog/2013/03/buying-a-gun-in-america/&quot;&gt;anti-gun campaigns&lt;/a&gt;; they can swing from &lt;a href=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Minard.png&quot;&gt;historical timeline-temperature charts of Napoleon&amp;#8217;s 1812 Russian escapade&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://ivancash.com/Infographic-of-Infographics&quot;&gt;cheeky design trend analytics&lt;/a&gt;. More than just great wall décor, they document and comment on the things that characterize humanities, generations, and cultures. And indeed, knowledge is power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B.C. poet &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shanekoyczan.com/&quot;&gt;Shane Koyczan&lt;/a&gt; was bullied a lot when he was a kid, which is something many of us can relate to. He, along with some extremely talented people, have created 7.5 breathtaking minutes describing the lasting effects bullying has on the lives of children and adults alike. The video—posted on February 19th—has more than 1.1 million hits and thousands upon thousands of comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experiences with violence in schools still echo throughout my life but standing to face the problem has helped me in immeasurable ways. -Shane Koyczan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project, &lt;a href=&quot;http://tothisdayproject.com/&quot;&gt;To This Day&lt;/a&gt;, aims to provide a message that will have a long-lasting effect in confronting bullying. You can help the effort &lt;a href=&quot;http://tothisdayproject.com/help&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and by sharing the message with as many people as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-10769&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid black;&quot; alt=&quot;IFAW_Infographic_SealHunt_V8_ac_FNL&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IFAW_Infographic_SealHunt_V8_ac_FNL-580x681.jpg&quot; width=&quot;522&quot; height=&quot;613&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversations about Canada&amp;#8217;s commercial seal hunt focus on whether or not one believes it&amp;#8217;s cruel to kill seals and whether or not one feels that seals are killed in a manner (struck in the forehead with a hakpik) that can be considered humane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out the questions themselves are massive red herrings (red seals?). That&amp;#8217;s the focus of a recent campaign we developed for the I&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ifaw.org/&quot;&gt;nternational Fund for Animal Welfare&lt;/a&gt; (IFAW).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our research into the issue revealed that the seal hunt isn&amp;#8217;t about economics or markets, it&amp;#8217;s about politics. In short, politicians feel they can&amp;#8217;t pull the plug on the seal hunt or even suggest that the industry is on life support (which it is) because it would cost them Atlantic Canadian votes. Even though the seal hunt represents a very small income for Atlantic Canadians, it&amp;#8217;s embedded with issues of identity and tradition that make it a hot button issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;&quot;&gt;Canadians don&amp;#8217;t really understand this. Our hunch was that if they did, they&amp;#8217;d come to the conclusion that investing in the seal hunt is a massive waste of resources.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IFAW campaign was developed in collaboration with &lt;a href=&quot;http://wildrun.ca/&quot;&gt;Wildrun Productions&lt;/a&gt;, a sharp team of comedy writers who brought the concept to life through content and video that points out the absurdity of the government&amp;#8217;s continued efforts to prop up the seal hunt both financially and politically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first phase of the campaign focuses on amazing new tax credits Canadians can access for using seal products in their homes. The tax credits come from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ifaw.org/canada/sealscampaign&quot;&gt;Department of Obsolete Industry&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8211;a faux branch of our government that along with revitalizing the cassette tape and party phone line industries is dedicated to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Working diligently to resurrect Canada’s commercial seal harvest by reconnecting Canadians with their glorious, blubber-scented history. &amp;#8220;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideas like seal blubber as fuel for cars and seal blubber based paint may seem absurd, but they are &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; projects our government has invested time and energy (oh and taxpayer dollars) into researching. Oh, and last year alone, the Canadian government spent $3.6 million to stockpile seal pelts that no one in the world wanted to buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ifaw.org/canada/sealscampaign&quot;&gt;Department of Obsolete Industry&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; new website. If you&amp;#8217;re looking to save some money on tax credits this year get oriented with this video that will help you determine how sophisticated technology from the 1700s could spell big savings for your family.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A tale of two Dog Lakes: Ontario Lakes Project</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/10702/a-tale-of-two-dog-lakes-ontario-lakes-project/attachment/dog-lake-01&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-10705&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-10705&quot; alt=&quot;Dog Lake-01&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Dog-Lake-01.png&quot; width=&quot;563&quot; height=&quot;335&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Home of a provincial park as well as a hydro dam supplying drinking water to the nearby town of Thunder Bay, Big Dog Lake and Little Dog Lake were once also the home of an Ojibway tribe. The names of the two lakes are derived from the image of a dog dug into a ridge between them. Legend has it that this noble dog alerted the sleeping village of an impending attack by the Cree, thus saving their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Dog Lake serves as a back-up drinking water supply for Thunder Bay; the town&amp;#8217;s primary source is Lake Superior.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Your website isn&#8217;t Times Square: How to guide your visitors gently.</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/your-website-isnt-times-square-how-to-guide-your-visitors-gently/"/>
   <updated>2013-03-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/your-website-isnt-times-square-how-to-guide-your-visitors-gently</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iawriter.com/&quot; title=&quot;iA Writer&quot;&gt;iAWriter&lt;/a&gt; lately and loving it. It&amp;#8217;s a delightful, distraction-free writing tool by &lt;a href=&quot;http://informationarchitects.net/&quot; title=&quot;iA Information Architects&quot;&gt;Information Architects&lt;/a&gt; (iA), a design consultancy based in Tokyo, Zurich and Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iA brings some very thoughtful elements into their own website design that are worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this screenshot of their blog, you&amp;#8217;ll see a black tab on the right with an estimate of how long it should take to finish reading the post. We don&amp;#8217;t all read at the same pace, of course, but they&amp;#8217;re leaving it to me to decide whether this is worth my time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_10682&quot; style=&quot;width: 515px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://informationarchitects.net/blog/100e2r/&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-10682&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot from informationarchitects.net&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ia-interface-screenshot.png&quot; width=&quot;505&quot; height=&quot;309&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    Thoughtful advice about user-centred design from iA
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very considerate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iA are an opinionated bunch, and it&amp;#8217;s worth noting some of the opinions expressed on this &lt;a href=&quot;http://informationarchitects.net/blog/100e2r/&quot; title=&quot;iA blog post on user-centered typography&quot;&gt;post on web typography&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Don&amp;#8217;t tell us to adjust the font size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Don&amp;#8217;t tell us busy pages look better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Don&amp;#8217;t tell us scrolling is bad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#8217;re fighting for user experience and they&amp;#8217;re taking no prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you work in a large organization, you may have stakeholders clamouring for their share of the home page. Everyone wants a billboard on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.earthcam.com/usa/newyork/timessquare/&quot; title=&quot;Times Square live&quot;&gt;Times Square&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But consider&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If everything stands out, nothing stands out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If everything&amp;#8217;s important, nothing&amp;#8217;s important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If everything&amp;#8217;s urgent, you risk losing your visitors to overwhelm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating useful design is as much about figuring out what to take away as knowing what to include.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than foisting organizational priorities on visitors, consider what they might be hoping to accomplish. And then help them do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shift in perspective could change everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are three things you can do next:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Get fierce about setting priorities for your site. Instead of bludgeoning your visitors, guide them gently. Many will follow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Get &lt;a href=&quot;http://iawriter.com&quot; title=&quot;iA Writer for Mac, iPad &amp;amp; iPhone&quot;&gt;iA Writer for your Mac, iPad and iPhone&lt;/a&gt; for simple, uncluttered, distraction-free writing (you can thank me later).&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Stop checking email. Start processing it.</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/stop-checking-email-start-processing-it/"/>
   <updated>2013-03-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/stop-checking-email-start-processing-it</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/101031023.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10676&quot; alt=&quot;Avalanche&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/101031023.jpg&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; height=&quot;367&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Email is an avalanche that never stops coming. And the problem will only get worse. Inboxes will get fuller. More people will be able to send more email from more devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One could argue that email&amp;#8217;s benefits are being eroded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, people have been seeking the holy grail of &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;http://inboxzero.com/&quot; title=&quot;Merlin Mann&amp;#39;s inbox zero articles and videos.&quot;&gt;inbox zero&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; since 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the deluge isn&amp;#8217;t going to stop, something else has to change. And that something else has to be our relationship with email. We&amp;#8217;re going to have to put it back in it&amp;#8217;s place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds hard, right? Well a new app I&amp;#8217;ve been using is helping. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mailboxapp.com/&quot; title=&quot;Mailbox website&quot;&gt;Mailbox&lt;/a&gt; seems to be working because it addresses habit change, not just email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mailbox&amp;#8217;s premise is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  You should control email, not the other way around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Your inbox is for new information; It&amp;#8217;s not a to-do list, and it&amp;#8217;s not an archive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  The shift I&amp;#8217;m making is from &amp;#8216;checking&amp;#8217; my email to &amp;#8216;processing&amp;#8217; it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  I find I&amp;#8217;m more inclined to schedule &amp;#8216;processing&amp;#8217; email as an activity, where I answer, delete, delegate, ask for it to come back later or file my emails in lists.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  If you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need help trying to stop checking email, try implementing this: &lt;a href=&quot;http://inboxpause.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://inboxpause.com/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  And if you could use some amazingly cogent tips on curbing your email habit, try Mike Rooney&amp;#8217;s post on &lt;a href=&quot;http://mikerooney.rowk.com/2012/12/31/achieving-email-bliss/&quot;&gt;achieving email bliss&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Diamond Lake in Bancroft Ontario is a mecca for ice climbers. There are steep cliff&amp;#8217;s behind Bancroft&amp;#8217;s main street where run off freezes over, creating the perfect conditions for adventure seekers. The spot called Eagle&amp;#8217;s Nest is so popular that&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alpineclubtoronto.ca/&quot;&gt; The Alpine Club of Canada&amp;#8217;s Toronto Chapter&lt;/a&gt; takes members on several weekend-long expeditions which are well suited to beginner and expert levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re keen to check it out, visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mec.ca/Main/home.jsp&quot;&gt;Mountain Equipment Coop&lt;/a&gt; to rent your equipment. If you&amp;#8217;re at all curious, watch two climbers do their stuff just 2 hours away from Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Libraries are no longer relevant</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/libraries-are-no-longer-relevant/"/>
   <updated>2013-02-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/libraries-are-no-longer-relevant</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At least they aren&amp;#8217;t according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://horrible-histories.co.uk/books&quot;&gt;Horrible Histories&lt;/a&gt; author, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.terry-deary.com/&quot;&gt;Terry Deary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During 2011-12, Deary&amp;#8217;s books were borrowed more than 500,000 times, making him the seventh most-borrowed children&amp;#8217;s writer from UK libraries last year. According to those numbers, he would have also been paid the maximum possible amount for a writer from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.plr.uk.com/&quot;&gt;UK Public Lending Right scheme&lt;/a&gt;. This gives authors 6.2p every time one of their books is borrowed, up to a £6,600. Deary is arguing that if someone were to have purchased the book instead of borrowing it from the library, he would be getting 30p per copy, bringing his total up to £180,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find the math is a bit off with this one. Deary is assuming that the &lt;em&gt;each individual person&lt;/em&gt; who borrowed his books was actually willing to purchase them in the first place. Completely ignoring the fact that libraries actually pay for the books, and the fact that the people reading his copies may have no interest whatsoever to purchase anything. He&amp;#8217;s calculating earnings that don&amp;#8217;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deary claims that &amp;#8220;books aren&amp;#8217;t public property, and writers aren&amp;#8217;t Enid Blyton, middle-class women indulging in a pleasant little hobby. They&amp;#8217;ve got to make a living. Authors, booksellers and publishers need to eat. We don&amp;#8217;t expect to go to a food library to be fed.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then goes on to say that &amp;#8220;this is not the Victorian age, when we wanted to allow the impoverished access to literature. We pay for compulsory schooling to do that.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Horrible comments aside, I feel a strong need to point out that libraries are not just for book distribution. They&amp;#8217;re pivotal community centres, and a place where everyone is welcome. Not to mention the fact that libraries actually &lt;em&gt;create readers&lt;/em&gt;. I can&amp;#8217;t even count how many authors I&amp;#8217;ve been introduced to just by going to the library and taking out random books. Books that I would then read, return, and then go straight to a book store to purchase my own copy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention the fact that I tend to glorify my favorite authors to everyone I know until they also buy their own copies (or I purchase one and literally place it in their hands to read if they refuse to purchase their own).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, good literature should be &lt;em&gt;shared, &lt;/em&gt;don&amp;#8217;t you agree?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Architecture in Graphic Design (Or, Graphic Design in Architecture)</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/architecture-in-graphic/"/>
   <updated>2013-02-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/architecture-in-graphic</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/design/10614/architecture-in-graphic/attachment/puzzle&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-10616&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-10616&quot; alt=&quot;Puzzle&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Puzzle-580x565.png&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;565&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having now gone through a relatively more intense deadline week (Hurrah!), I&amp;#8217;ve been graciously asked to briefly write about some reflections on my experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was browsing through an article Barry recommended, &lt;em&gt;Without Contrast, You&amp;#8217;re Dead&lt;/em&gt; by Nancy Bernard in a 2000 issue of &lt;em&gt;Critique&lt;/em&gt;. Bernard adeptly goes over the basics of aesthetics and composition, an arsenal of elements by which graphic design may be critiqued. It was a great read; while being a graphic designer requires a level of talent, talent can only go so far without a good deal of nurturing and shaping through theory education and practice (this rings true for any vocation, really). The article spoke on the importance of contrast, scale, rhythm, balance, tension, movement, et cetera. As I read on these things and hacked away at the project I was working on, I was seeing (and feeling) a very similar array of issues and emotions between laying out a large-scale infographic as a graphic designer and laying out a floorplan as an architect (figures). To help articulate the notions I&amp;#8217;ve decided to quickly put this comparative chart together:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/design/10614/architecture-in-graphic/attachment/matrix-3&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-10632&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-10632&quot; alt=&quot;matrix&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/matrix2-580x269.png&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;269&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose the lesson of the day here is that, when it comes to aesthetics and atmosphere in relation to the organization of elements, the same rule applies. And it is by this rule regarding contrast that almost subconsciously makes a design beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why are You Afraid to Talk to Your List?</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/why-are-you-afraid-to-talk-to-your-list/"/>
   <updated>2013-02-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/why-are-you-afraid-to-talk-to-your-list</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_10601&quot; style=&quot;width: 272px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-10601 &quot; alt=&quot;Email sign up form&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/1.png&quot; width=&quot;262&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    Email sign up from DIY Themes
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  I was recently helping a client set up the &lt;a title=&quot;Customizing Email Signup Forms in MailChimp&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.mailchimp.com/customizing-email-signup-forms-in-mailchimp/&quot;&gt;email newsletter capture form&lt;/a&gt; for their website.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The client has a hyper-networked role, often attending conferences, presenting workshops and travelling to make connections and extend the reach and relevance of their organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of things they hoped to learn about their subscribers was considerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Name,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Email address,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  City,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Organizational affiliation,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Professional affiliation,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  And much more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We agreed this was putting up a barrier to participation. That the more fields we put in the form, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.kissmetrics.com/increase-user-sign-ups/&quot; title=&quot;5 simple tips to help you increase user sign ups&quot;&gt;the less likely people will be to sign up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the nature of the client&amp;#8217;s organization this information would be extremely valuable. And they hoped many would be happy to share it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this presents a valuable opportunity for a marketer, as I&amp;#8217;ll explain in a minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, realize that people don&amp;#8217;t care about your newsletter. They don&amp;#8217;t want to be on your list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What they want is to get to know you better; to be part of your community; to gain insight and knowledge; to get the inside scoop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#8217;re looking for value and connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Derek Halpern of Social Triggers &lt;a href=&quot;http://socialtriggers.com/what-do-people-buy/&quot; title=&quot;Derek Halpern on what people buy&quot;&gt;shares&lt;/a&gt; how he gauges what his customers want to buy. He replies to every email subscription with the question…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What are you struggling with?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question goes out by autoresponder, of course. He doesn&amp;#8217;t write each of these emails individually. But he genuinely wants to know, and he responds to every reply he gets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is, he&amp;#8217;s engaging his followers in dialogue. He&amp;#8217;s demonstrating interest in their needs and showing his commitment to create real value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Value and connection. That&amp;#8217;s why people are on your list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the help of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mailchimp.com/features/autoresponders/&quot; title=&quot;MailChimp autoresponder features&quot;&gt;autoresponder&lt;/a&gt; built right into MailChimp (or whatever email provider you use) you can start a dialogue right now that invites connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you&amp;#8217;re selling, or growing a community of like-minded activists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of making people jump through hoops to get a dry impersonal email, your newsletter could be the beginning of a long and mutually fruitful relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d love to hear whether you&amp;#8217;ve tried anything like this. And where it&amp;#8217;s taken you. Please share below.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-10584 alignleft&quot; alt=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-e1361162910815.png&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Everyone has various feelings towards email, but they generally fall into the &amp;#8220;necessary evil&amp;#8221; bucket. We need it, we get too much of it, check it way to often and use it as a very inefficient filing system most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it&amp;#8217;s been around in various forms for decades, 1978 marks the year that the first email system was created at &lt;a href=&quot;http://theemaillab.org/history-of-email.asp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UMDMJ&lt;/a&gt; in Newark, NJ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite it&amp;#8217;s various incarnations, it hasn&amp;#8217;t really changed much since then. You can argue that Hotmail, Gmail and Yahoo! Mail and whatever tried, they really just put new paint on an old car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a renewed interest in email and how we manage it with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mailboxapp.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mailbox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://evomail.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Evomail&lt;/a&gt; leading the charge. Both are mobile apps and they both claim that they want to change the way we interact and think about email. It&amp;#8217;s about time, but not surprising given the fact that mobile email viewing and surfing is skyrocketing.&lt;/p&gt;

*&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a couple of weeks ago &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cisco.com/en/US/solutions/collateral/ns341/ns525/ns537/ns705/ns827/white_paper_c11-520862.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cisco&amp;#8217;s global mobile traffic forecast&lt;/a&gt; for 2013 &amp;#8211; 2017 stated that,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of 2013, the number of mobile-connected devices will exceed the number of people on earth, and by 2017 there will be nearly 1.4 mobile devices per capita. There will be over 10 billion mobile-connected devices in 2017, including machine-to-machine (M2M) modules-exceeding the world&amp;#8217;s population at that time (7.6 billion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;#8217;m still waiting to play around with either of these new email clients. Evomail is going to be released sometime early 2013 and I am in the world&amp;#8217;s longest queue to get my hands on Mailbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I signed up for Mailbox I had close to 600,ooo people in front of me. A week later, I&amp;#8217;ve still got 383,567 people ahead of me and  432,529 people behind me. They&amp;#8217;re doing this in order to safely scale up without any problems, but it also highlights the fact that there really is a thirst for better email management. People are tired of email controlling them. They want to be in charge and it seems that&amp;#8217;s the way that Mailbox is being designed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big guns better be taking notes. They&amp;#8217;ve got me hooked&amp;#8230;now if only the lineup would hurry up already.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Howdy!</title>

   <updated>2013-02-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/howdy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Instacode-Tim.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10564&quot; alt=&quot;Hello my name is Tim.&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Instacode-Tim.png&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;512&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Tim Whittley and I&amp;#8217;m a new web developer at Hypenotic. I&amp;#8217;ve been working with Hypenotic part-time since the fall, but now I&amp;#8217;m here full time which means I&amp;#8217;m way past due for an introduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a web developer I&amp;#8217;m completely self taught. About six years ago I was rather bored with my job working in the back room at a recording studio. One of the studio owners noticed my penchant for all things computer related and suggested I learn web development. I set out with the humble goal of learning XHTML, CSS2, Javascript (straight up, no jQuery), and a bit of Flash. Before long I was pretty comfortable with all that and moved on to programming in PHP, developing WordPress themes and trying out some Ruby on Rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jump ahead to 2013. The web development landscape has changed drastically for us developers. On the technical end of things HTML5, CSS3, and responsive design have evolved, and J&lt;a title=&quot;The Plight of Pinocchio&quot; href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/bkeepers/the-plight-of-pinocchio&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;avaScript is well on it&amp;#8217;s way to being a real language&lt;/a&gt;. New toys like Git, SASS, and Chrome&amp;#8217;s developer tools give us a powerful new toolset. We&amp;#8217;ve also learned to pay attention to user experience, content strategy, and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m happy to be here at Hypenotic where all this new and shiny technology, and the new ways of thinking about the web are embraced. Thanks to everyone at Hypenotic for having me. I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to whatever comes next.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Dalhousie Lake Loons &#8220;Gettin&#8217; Busy&#8221; on a Platform: Ontario Lakes Project</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/dalhousie-lake-loons-gettin-busy-on-a-platform-ontario-lakes-project/"/>
   <updated>2013-02-12T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/dalhousie-lake-loons-gettin-busy-on-a-platform-ontario-lakes-project</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/ontario-lakes-project/10546/dalhousie-lake-loons-gettin-busy-on-a-platform-ontario-lakes-project/attachment/dalhousie-01&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-10551&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-10551&quot; alt=&quot;Dalhousie-01&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Dalhousie-01-580x723.png&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;723&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, that the call of loons in fundamental to the Ontario lake experience. Their haunting calls are the perfect soundtrack to a relaxing evening at the cottage. Even though they are the symbol of utter relaxation, it turns out these birds are quite stressed. This is not good news. Loons&amp;#8217; nests are easily impacted by rising water levels, power boats and shoreline development. This has the Dalhousie Lake dwellers taking a DIY approach to providing them refuge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A volunteer member of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dlai.ca/&quot;&gt;Dalhousie Lake Association&lt;/a&gt; has shared information on building a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dlai.ca/Loon+Nesting.pdf&quot;&gt;DIY Loon Nesting Platform&lt;/a&gt; to be an inviting and safe habitat for loon populations. Turns out, all you need are cedar log, vinyl-coated chain-link fence, two anchors or cinder blocks and stuff for the nest&amp;#8211;like straw, bulrushes, long grasses, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this NSFW video, two loons demonstrate just how comfy the platform can be by &amp;#8220;gettin&amp;#8217; it on&amp;#8221; (albiet briefly) on an artificial platform. Even the loons know how to keep the love life fresh.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Road that Leads to Awesome</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/the-road-that-leads-to-awesome/"/>
   <updated>2013-02-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/the-road-that-leads-to-awesome</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know about you, but I&amp;#8217;ve always loved watching football movies. There&amp;#8217;s a common element in every single one of them that makes the entire movie worth it. Sorry football fans, I&amp;#8217;m not referring to the final game where the underdog wins, I&amp;#8217;m talking about the &lt;em&gt;pep talk&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every football movie has them. It&amp;#8217;s that scene where the coach gives the team a beautiful speech, typically accompanied by some very inspiring music. Is it cheesy? Absolutely. But I always find myself loving every single minute of those scenes (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQYGGkzZ9HE&quot;&gt;Rudy&lt;/a&gt;, anyone?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are so receptive to these pep talks. They make you think about what drives you. It instills a sense of trust and confidence in yourself, and of those around you. And, not surprisingly, self reflection is a huge part of the learning and growing process. Unfortunately, in such a busy world, it&amp;#8217;s typically one of those things that tend to fall off the radar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, for those of you who aren&amp;#8217;t really into the whole football movie thing, &lt;a href=&quot;http://soulpancake.com/&quot;&gt;Soul Pancake&lt;/a&gt; has released an amazing video that puts all football coach speeches to shame, while still giving you that &amp;#8220;I need to go do something great!&amp;#8221; feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bonus: It&amp;#8217;s also one of the cutest things you&amp;#8217;ll see all day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Meet my wacky new friend.</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/meet-my-wacky-new-friend/"/>
   <updated>2013-02-07T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/meet-my-wacky-new-friend</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/10509/meet-my-wacky-new-friend/attachment/bold-is-a-friend-01&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-10510&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-10510&quot; alt=&quot;Bold is a friend-01&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Bold-is-a-friend-01-580x371.png&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;371&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon an initial encounter with architecture school, exhibitions, and lectures, one will notice that the &lt;del&gt;colour&lt;/del&gt; black is a big old favourite. If one&amp;#8217;s creative, they&amp;#8217;ll throw in some vibrant splashes of grey. A truly venturous one will dare a [real] colour or two as an accent piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to graphic design relating to architectural design, the graphics must always be tame enough to let the architecture keep the spotlight. You will find size zero pt. linework and thin, sans typography, all caps, discreetly shying away in their 10pt textboxes. Everything is streamlined, slick, minimalist. Architects have pet fonts, the go-to assumed to be good for all occasions (DIN and I are like Linus and his blue blanket). And, I suppose that works for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might recall in a previous post that I was itching to try something different for this internship. With graphic design and illustration being the stars of this show, I am being given a makeover in my visual thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graphics and typography in architecture point to the architectural drawings and renderings, which in turn convey the message.&lt;br&gt;
Here, however, the point is still to get the message across, but the twist is that the language is purely graphic. Type and pictures come together wearing shiny bright outfits that catch peoples&amp;#8217; attention; all the while there still exists principal as well as supporting actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, there is a certain level of shock (followed by delight) that comes when you realize several things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 13px;&quot;&gt;Colour is your friend. Colours have colour friends. Good ol&amp;#8217; grey will get along with them just fine. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  It&amp;#8217;s O.K. to use funky, loopy, chunky, BIG typography. What&amp;#8217;s a party without a diva?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  It is important to maintain hierarchy. Too many divas in one room results in cat-brawls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Compact is cool, but not everything needs to be flatpacked. Type needs its personal space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also learned that dijon goes really well with tuna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Minimalist Web Design and Development</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/minimalist-web-design-and-development/"/>
   <updated>2013-02-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/minimalist-web-design-and-development</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s so much web development advice and design best practices out in digital land, we often get lost trying to keep up with the current evolution and thinking when it comes to our craft. I often lie on the couch and swipe through the recent additions to the content universe and think &amp;#8220;shit, how can I keep up?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We, who develop and design in the world of pixels, need reminding to stay still, take stock and look around a bit. We need to keep things minimalist.  Does this piece of functionality really help the user? Is there a simpler way of creating that ends with the same result. I found this poster by &lt;a title=&quot;Grant Snider&quot; href=&quot;http://www.incidentalcomics.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Grant Snider&lt;/a&gt; that pretty much sums it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 13px;&quot;&gt;Get rid of the unnecessary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Create structure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Stop searching for hidden meaning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Embrace what is solid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Lose yourself in patterns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Don&amp;#8217;t fear empty space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Stay clean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Be bold and colorful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Don&amp;#8217;t be too expressive!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Less &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; more&amp;#8230;but less is more difficult than it looks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>5 Reasons Developers need to be Educators</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/5-reasons-developers-need-to-be-educators/"/>
   <updated>2013-02-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/5-reasons-developers-need-to-be-educators</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_10481&quot; style=&quot;width: 590px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/developer-client.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-10481&quot; alt=&quot;From 1stWebDesigner&#39;s Life #4&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/developer-client.png&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;323&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    From 1stWebDesigner&amp;#8217;s Life #4
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been awhile since I wrote a blog post, but that&amp;#8217;s not to say I haven&amp;#8217;t been writing. In fact, I&amp;#8217;ve been writing more and more each day but it&amp;#8217;s just not for you&amp;#8230;it&amp;#8217;s for our clients.  My &amp;#8220;topics&amp;#8221; haven&amp;#8217;t been about the &amp;#8220;practical&amp;#8221; stuff like timelines or project updates either, it&amp;#8217;s been about education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s right, more and more I&amp;#8217;ve been taking the time to teach our clients about what we do and how we do it.  You might be thinking &amp;#8220;oh, that&amp;#8217;s very nice of you&amp;#8221;, but really, it&amp;#8217;s for selfish reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telling the client that the problem is fixed is not enough. It&amp;#8217;s kinda like that ol&amp;#8217; saying&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; Teach him to use the Internet, and he won&amp;#8217;t bother you for weeks!&amp;#8221; In our case, it&amp;#8217;s about  teaching our clients about what the problem is, the logic we took to fix the problem and what walls we came up against in troubleshooting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;#8217;t just have to be about bug squashing either. It could be about the benefits of using &lt;a href=&quot;http://foundation.zurb.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Zurb&amp;#8217;s Foundation framework&lt;/a&gt;, or how &lt;a href=&quot;http://modularscale.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;modular scale&lt;/a&gt; works or the reason for using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/03/24/how-to-choose-a-typeface/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;one typeface&lt;/a&gt; over another or why &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9418/giddyup-with-github-our-development-process&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; is just plain awesome.  Here are some of the why&amp;#8217;s about the how&amp;#8217;s:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 13px;&quot;&gt;Transparency. Having client&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;see&amp;#8221; what you&amp;#8217;re doing has huge value. They feel involved and are able to pass on that understanding to other problems or technologies. It helps them understand your point of view and ultimately see the amount of effort it takes to deliver a product or service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; You help them become an expert. By explaining what you are doing and how you&amp;#8217;re doing it, you&amp;#8217;re enabling them to become the internal expert in their company or organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Clients become partners. This follows from #1 and #2. If the client understands what you&amp;#8217;re doing and slowly becomes an expert in their own right, the client and service relationship becomes much more of a partnership. Projects become collaborative rather than separate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; It saves time. Educating clients saves a bunch of time. When they know more, you need to explain less.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; It&amp;#8217;s fun. Helping people get better is gratifying and you might even be bought lunch or beer by doing it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking the time to educate is critical. Taking the time now will save you time later.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Mailchimp dares you to unsubscribe</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/mailchimp-dares-you-to-unsubscribe/"/>
   <updated>2013-02-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/mailchimp-dares-you-to-unsubscribe</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft  wp-image-10408&quot; alt=&quot;MailChimp winks at you&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/mailchimp-winking.png&quot; width=&quot;173&quot; height=&quot;173&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent email I received from &lt;a href=&quot;http://mailchimp.com&quot; title=&quot;MailChimp&quot;&gt;MailChimp&lt;/a&gt; sported a feature I hadn&amp;#8217;t noticed before. Perhaps it was new. It was definitely bold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only the biggest freakin&amp;#8217; unsubscribe link I&amp;#8217;ve ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check it out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_10470&quot; style=&quot;width: 475px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-10470 &quot; alt=&quot;MailChimp&#39;s big, bold, unsubscribe link&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/mailchimps-big-usub-link2.png&quot; width=&quot;465&quot; height=&quot;175&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    MailChimp dares you to unsubscribe
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s BIG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most newsletters bury their unsubscribe links among administrivia like your mailing address or how you got on your list (I realize these are required by law in some jurisdictions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason is obvious: Most senders of newsletters don&amp;#8217;t want you to unsubscribe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, why would MailChimp do this? Could it be because they don&amp;#8217;t care if you unsubscribe?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That could actually be quite liberating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you didn&amp;#8217;t care whether people unsubscribed from your list you could&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Break free of your impersonal marketing-speak rut and write content that aims to really connect with people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Use your newsletter to experiment with new content ideas and learn from the feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Spam your list to death and engender a lot of bad will&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, that last one is not something to strive for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given their clever use of the first two, I&amp;#8217;m convinced MailChimps DOES care about their faithful following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;#8217;s a thought&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps MailChimp&amp;#8217;s years of email experimentation have taught them there&amp;#8217;s a lot to be gained by eliminating the friction unsubscribing. Beyond compliance issues, consider that&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Good will is engendered when your readers feel you respect them enough to leave on their terms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Unsubscribes are a form of feedback; You can learn from them what resonates with your community (and what doesn&amp;#8217;t)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Your emails should draw prospects closer to doing business with you; If they&amp;#8217;re not interested in hearing from you, maybe they&amp;#8217;re not a good fit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marketing is not for the timid. It takes courage to step out boldly and develop your own voice. You won&amp;#8217;t please everybody; nor should you try. Unsubscribes are one valuable source of feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Life is Like Slalom Waterskiing on Crowe Lake: Ontario Lakes Project</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/ontario-lakes-project/10447/life-is-like-slalom-waterskiing-on-crowe-lake-ontario-lakes-project/attachment/crowe-lake&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-10453&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-10453&quot; alt=&quot;Crowe Lake&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Crowe-Lake-580x289.png&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;289&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;Forest Gump might think that &amp;#8220;life is like a box of chocolates&amp;#8221; but lately around our house, we&amp;#8217;ve been talking about how life is like a waterslide&amp;#8211;intense, thrilling, scary, fun. It&amp;#8217;s a ride where you never know what&amp;#8217;s around the corner, but that&amp;#8217;s the whole idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This great Slalom-cam video of shot on Crowe Lake in the Kawarthas makes me think that life is also a lot like slalom waterskiing on Crowe lake. If you&amp;#8217;re anything like me, waterskiing (on two skis never mind one) is both exhilarating and terrifying. If you do it on one ski, it&amp;#8217;s all those things to the power of ten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching this video makes my stomach muscles tense up and puts a smile on my face. Feels like how most of my days go down. What does it do for you? Is life like slalom waterskiing? a waterslide? a box of chocolates? a colonoscopy?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Method of Action: Gamifying the Love of Learning &#038; Design</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/method-of-action-gamifying-the-love-of-learning-design/"/>
   <updated>2013-01-31T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/method-of-action-gamifying-the-love-of-learning-design</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://method.ac/&quot;&gt;Method of Action&lt;/a&gt; is a peer-to-peer educational website that targets three categories: Design, Entrepreneurship, and Gardening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each course is comprised of 50 &amp;#8220;missions&amp;#8221; that contain videos, articles, resources and tools that can help you accomplish your goal, and ultimately advance your knowledge of the subject at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#8217;ve completed a task, you submit your results to a panel of more experienced peers who will then review it and give you a passing or failing grade. If you pass, you get points allowing you to access more challenging missions. Eventually, if you gain enough experience (exp), you&amp;#8217;ll even be able to become part of the review panel and help others accomplish their goals in return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core foundation is simple really; most people learn by doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Knowledge is acquired by actually doing things and reflecting upon it. Proactively thinking about how you can improve what you did.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10437&quot; alt=&quot;Blog_Exp_Learning&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Blog_Exp_Learning.png&quot; width=&quot;389&quot; height=&quot;289&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOA claims that while you can get pretty far with just doing, eventually you&amp;#8217;re going to need someone to tell you how to get beyond what you already know. You&amp;#8217;re going to need help setting milestones, and provide guidance on exercises to help you get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this idea is absolutely amazing. I for one know that I learn much faster if I&amp;#8217;m actively participating. I&amp;#8217;ve read articles and tutorials on how to code a website, but until I actually attempted a few exercises alongside what I was reading, nothing I read really stuck or made much sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re reading this and are interested in learning more about design, or are already a designer who wants to brush up on some of those lessons we learned back in Typography 101, check out  the following games:&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://getpoole.com/yes-google-im-feeling-lucky</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/10410/yes-google-im-feeling-lucky/attachment/self-portrait-01&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-10420&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-10420&quot; alt=&quot;self portrait-01&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/self-portrait-01-580x439.png&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;439&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello world,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Dorothy and I am the intern at Hypenotic for the next few months!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m roughly two weeks in, so it&amp;#8217;s time I introduced myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My lifelong goal is to become a missionary, perhaps in Myanmar or China or even Germany; I&amp;#8217;m not exactly sure yet, but I know it will happen one day.&lt;br&gt;
My dream job would be to illustrate childrens&amp;#8217; books.&lt;br&gt;
My all-time favourites are C.S. Lewis, George Balanchine, Simon &amp;amp; Garfunkel, William Turner, rabbits, and pretzels with butter in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am an architecture student in my final year at the University of Waterloo; &lt;em&gt;how strange,&lt;/em&gt; you say? Indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This semester, I was convinced that I didn&amp;#8217;t want to intern at an architecture office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sure I&amp;#8217;m just unlucky, but my past architecture internships have consisted of working on deadline-oriented, money-busting, consumeristic, elitist architecture for fashionable clients (I hope I don&amp;#8217;t sound bitter). This is the final co-op semester before I graduate from architecture school, so I wanted to try something that would refresh and re-inspire me about design, that good design is design with a purpose (a good purpose at that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am particularly interested in learning more about communications design because it is potentially a powerful tool in catalyzing connection between people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is something very special about graphics because it is communications in its purest form, virtually accessible to anybody &amp;#8212; it transcends academia levels and language barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across Hypenotic while googling a list of of design firms in Toronto (nothing fancy).&lt;br&gt;
Beyond the awesome name, Hypenotic stuck out to me, because this office is concerned with values-driven projects, projects that actually make a positive difference in the community and in daily life. I reckoned that over the next few months, I would learn several things to carry with me in the career ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincerely delighted upon the happenstance of Hypenotic&amp;#8217;s website showing up on google,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dorothy.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A web design legend relaunches, but its 10 best lessons aren&#8217;t about design</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/a-web-design-legend-relaunches-but-its-best-lessons-arent-about-design/"/>

   <id>http://getpoole.com/a-web-design-legend-relaunches-but-its-best-lessons-arent-about-design</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-28-at-10.15.23-AM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-10415&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2013-01-28 at 10.15.23 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-28-at-10.15.23-AM-580x390.png&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like I&amp;#8217;ve been reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://alistapart.com/article/a-list-apart-relaunches-new-features-new-design&quot; title=&quot;A lIst Apart&quot;&gt;A List Apart forever&lt;/a&gt;. In case you don&amp;#8217;t now it, it&amp;#8217;s been the journal of a team called Happy Cog who&amp;#8217;ve been inventing the web since the web went mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond informative, engaging and timely  content,  reading it has always been a pleasure. A List Apart has always taken the user experience into account and it showed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They just launched a significant over-haul, with all of the care for craft you&amp;#8217;d expect, but I think the most instructive lessons from the launch are less about the design and more about the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;Lessons are marked in red.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took them 14 months (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;1. &lt;/span&gt;What&amp;#8217;s the rush, exactly?&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt; 2. &lt;/span&gt;Slow cooking is always richer)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They brought in several of their top guns past and present (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;3. &lt;/span&gt;It takes familiarity with subject matter and passionate talent to make something noteworthy, let alone iconic)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They launch with a disclaimer letting faithful readers and newbies know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  If you find an obvious bug or UX flaw, they&amp;#8217;re probably working on it (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;4. &lt;/span&gt;Bugs are natural. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;5. &lt;/span&gt;Imperfections are inevitable, embrace it–or at least get over it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  There&amp;#8217;s more to come, but new features will be launched when they&amp;#8217;re ready (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;6. &lt;/span&gt;The site is a living thing, and will grow naturally)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  It&amp;#8217;s yours, please let us know how it can be fixed/improved/evolved (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;7. &lt;/span&gt;Your feedback is a driver in this endeavour)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time I wrote this, there were 76 comments, many of them readers noting bugs or making recommendations ranging from accessibility considerations (tweaks to be compliant) to UI questions (hyper-link colours), etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, many of the comments are from the design/dev team, responding to the feedback, including letting readers know when bugs have been squashed. (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;8. &lt;/span&gt;Getting free, timely insight into how you can improve is a research coup. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;9. &lt;/span&gt;You score off the charts goodwill by responding to comments right away, and approval rates go stratospheric when you respond by actually fixing the &amp;#8216;problems&amp;#8217; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;10. &lt;/span&gt;Even if you&amp;#8217;re not commenting on the bugs, it&amp;#8217;s heartening to see such a thriving community)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of this is common sense, if not common courtesy. It&amp;#8217;s all worth noting because even though we know it, most organizations don&amp;#8217;t do it. The web, for many, is still a burden. An afterthought. A nice to do when you can get to it. And when people do focus on it, they focus on the wrong things. Instead of arbitrary launch dates, why not focus on when the product will have value? Instead of getting every bug squashed, why not engage your audience in a dialogue about the content and experience they care about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are bold, scary ideas. Just the kind to separate the leaders from the followers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Crotch Lake (AKA: The Crotch): Ontario Lakes Project</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/crotch-lake-aka-the-crotch-ontario-lakes-project/"/>
   <updated>2013-01-24T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/crotch-lake-aka-the-crotch-ontario-lakes-project</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/ontario-lakes-project/10389/crotch-lake-aka-the-crotch-ontario-lakes-project/attachment/crotch-lake-01&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-10402&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-10402&quot; alt=&quot;crotch lake-01&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/crotch-lake-01-580x348.png&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;348&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This has to be the best (or worst depending on your perspective) name for an Ontario Lake so far. Crotch Lake, 1.5 hours from Ottawa is often referred to as &amp;#8220;The Crotch.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  From a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lakeontariounited.com/fishing/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;amp;t=18869&quot;&gt;fishing forum&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;my family and I have been going up to &amp;#8220;the Crotch&amp;#8221; for several years now.&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  From &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tinboattravels.com/crotch-lake-ontario-2010.html&quot;&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;we headed for The Crotch in May of 2010.&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trailpeak.com/trail-Crotch-Lake-Kayak-Canoe-near-Ottawa-ON-3190&quot;&gt;From a trip review on a kayak site&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;We even debated leaving altogether, without giving the Crotch a chance.&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This final writer gives both the Lake, and its name a big &amp;#8216;ol thumbs up. Here&amp;#8217;s why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In hindsight our trip members were very grateful that Crotch Lake was last in line when lake names were being handed out. If it held the name &amp;#8220;500 Island lake&amp;#8221;, or, &amp;#8220;Towering pine lake &amp;#8212; &amp;#8220;Over granite shoreline&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;Large pristine lake without cottages&amp;#8221; all of which are true, then it would be over run. We even debated leaving altogether, without giving the Crotch a chance. The spirits of the lake had surely done all they could to discourage another visitor. After some friendly debate, we pressed on, curious. What we found was paradise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out the name Crotch Lake is a blessing for the Lake and those who visit. In short, it keeps the crotch sniffers away.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Beyoncé&#8217;s Pirate Booty, or another kind of economy?</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/beyonces-pirate-booty-or-another-kind-of-economy/"/>
   <updated>2013-01-19T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/beyonces-pirate-booty-or-another-kind-of-economy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, in his NY Times piece, Mark Bittman asked &amp;#8220;&lt;a title=&quot;Why Do Stars Think It’s O.K. to Sell Soda?&quot; href=&quot;http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/why-do-stars-think-its-o-k-to-sell-soda/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Why Do Stars Think It’s O.K. to Sell Soda?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; and examined why a mega celebrity like Beyonce would shill for Pepsi:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowles is renting her image to a product that may one day be ranked with cigarettes as a killer we were too slow to rein in. From saying, as she once did in referring to Let’s Move, that she was “excited to be part of this effort that addresses a public health crisis,” she’s become part of an effort that promotes a public health crisis. I suppose it would be one thing if she needed the money or the exposure but she and Jay-Z &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.celebritynetworth.com/articles/entertainment-articles/1-richest-celebrity-couples/&quot; title=&quot;http://www.celebritynetworth.com/articles/entertainment-articles/1-richest-celebrity-couples/&quot;&gt;are worth around $775 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It got me thinking–knowing what we know about the addictive properties of soda and their effect on our health, what really could motivate a celebrity (or anyone who doesn&amp;#8217;t need the money or profile) to shill for a toxic substance? Beyonce&amp;#8217;s an innovator, right? Shouldn&amp;#8217;t she be bucking trends?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chalked it up to a different world view. I reasoned that Beyonce learned somewhere that the definition of success is to acquire as much personal wealth as possible, at any expense. And I put it out of my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Week&amp;#8217;s Sunday Edition with Michael Enright featured an interview with Stephen Lewis, including an introduction that called him:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;arguably Canada&amp;#8217;s most tenacious and persistent advocate for social justice&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, hearing Stephen Lewis speak is even more captivating than watching Beyonce gyrate. But that&amp;#8217;s beside the point; the intro made me realize that Stephen Lewis&amp;#8217; entire career has been about uncovering, articulating and addressing inequality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did he come by that job? Moreover, &lt;em&gt;why isn&amp;#8217;t that everyone&amp;#8217;s job&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Marshall McLuhan said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;There are no passengers on spaceship earth. We are all crew.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did he mean that some of the crew should look out for themselves at others&amp;#8217; expense and some of the crew should make a career out of helping others? Did he mean like a pirate crew, where the goal is booty? Or did he mean like any other crew that gets where it&amp;#8217;s going fastest and easiest by working together?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming he meant the latter, what would it take to create a system that led more people along Stephen Lewis&amp;#8217; path?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better guidance counselors? Is it about our education system?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if, instead of teaching us how things work in the current (arguably failing) consumption-driven economic model, we left school equipped to address social issues? You could still be a Lawyer, Dr, Scientist, Urban Planner, Teacher, Social Worker, or User Experience Designer or custodial artists, but you&amp;#8217;d ply your trade with a view to address common challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if we studied &lt;a title=&quot;Ken Burns on PBS&quot; href=&quot;http://www.pbs.org/kenburns/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ken Burns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&quot;Ted Talks list&quot; href=&quot;http://www.ted.com/talks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TEDtalks&lt;/a&gt;, Native Elders, Farmers, &lt;a title=&quot;Raj Patel website&quot; href=&quot;http://rajpatel.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Raj Patel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&quot;CBC Massey Lectures&quot; href=&quot;http://www.cbc.ca/ideas/episodes/massey-lectures/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Massey lectures&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&quot;Manfred Max-Neef on Wikipedia&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_Max_Neef&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Manfred Max Neef&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&quot;The Story of Stuff Project&quot; href=&quot;http://www.storyofstuff.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the Story of Stuff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&quot;MACKLEMORE &amp; RYAN LEWIS - SAME LOVE feat. MARY LAMBERT&quot; href=&quot;&lt;iframe width=&amp;quot;560&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;315&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/hlVBg7_08n0&amp;quot; frameborder=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Macklemore&lt;/a&gt; and the &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;The Giraffe Heroes Project: People who stick their neck out&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;http://www.giraffe.org/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Giraffe Heroes Project&lt;/a&gt;? The folks whose backs are close enough to read the writing on the wall? The people who do the full cost accounting? The people who think big picture, long term, big tent?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t think we all need to end up being Stephen Lewis, I&amp;#8217;m just thinking it would be nice to net out somewhere between an understanding that &amp;#8216;many hands make light work&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;if you&amp;#8217;re not part of the solution you&amp;#8217;re part of the problem&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pepsi&amp;#8217;s newest tagline is &amp;#8220;Live For Now.&amp;#8221; Here&amp;#8217;s how Pepsi&amp;#8217;s President of Global Enjoyment Brands (??) described the new global strategy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8216;Live for Now&amp;#8217; embodies a mind-set that is true of Pepsi loyalists around the world, while still connecting with a large and growing number of consumers who share the same values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Live for now. Perhaps this &amp;#8220;mind set&amp;#8221; is what&amp;#8217;s keeping us from tearing our gaze from the pirate booty and addressing what&amp;#8217;s really valuable in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Joyful Ass Flaunting vs. Shameful Ass Covering</title>

   <id>http://getpoole.com/joyful-ass-flaunting-vs-shameful-ass-covering</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/fun-stuff/10360/joyful-ass-flaunting-vs-shameful-ass-covering/attachment/screen-shot-2013-01-18-at-11-58-24-am&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-10367&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10367&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2013-01-18 at 11.58.24 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-shot-2013-01-18-at-11.58.24-AM.png&quot; width=&quot;298&quot; height=&quot;197&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t watch the Lance/Oprah interview last night. Still, all this talk of confessions, apologizing and backtracking has me craving figures who have massive quantities integrity. In other words, I want to spend my time thinking about those supreme beings who engage in full-on, joyful ass flaunting as opposed to shameful, pathetic ass covering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lance Armstrong and Paul Simon have something interesting in common; Oprah Winfrey. Lance appeared in his first &amp;#8220;confessional&amp;#8221; interview on Oprah&amp;#8217;s OWN network last night. In other news, Oprah has publicly declared &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graceland_(album)&quot;&gt;Paul Simon&amp;#8217;s Graceland &lt;/a&gt;her favorite album. Good taste lady.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the holidays I watched a mind-blowing PBS documentary about Paul Simon&amp;#8217;s making of Graceland called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2112868/&quot;&gt;Under African Skies&lt;/a&gt; which coincided with the album&amp;#8217;s 25th Anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a slew of controversy about Graceland when it was released. The most damning accusation levelled at Simon was that because he flew to Johannesburg to record Graceland during apartheid, he broke a UN Boycott that banned artists from performing in the country. Dali Tambo, the South African co-founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.artistsagainstapartheid.org/&quot;&gt;Artists Against Apartheid&lt;/a&gt; believed that Simon recording in South Africa served as an endorsement of South Africa&amp;#8217;s racist, cruel politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simon disagreed. He didn&amp;#8217;t just disagree, he joyfully flaunted his beliefs in a glorious display of integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simon adamantly believed that a tour featuring South African music and artists could generate awareness and mobilize people to put an end to the apartheid regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, instead of apologizing, retracting or making concessions about his trip to South Africa, Simon invited South African legend and anti apartheid activists &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miriam_Makeba&quot;&gt;Miriam Makeba &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href=&quot;http://edition.cnn.com/2009/TRAVEL/04/01/masekela.interview/index.html&quot;&gt;Hugh Masekela&lt;/a&gt; to join his tour. Coupled with the incredible talents of&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mambazo.com/&quot;&gt; Ladysmith Black Mambazo&lt;/a&gt; and Simon himself, the tour brought music and people together in a revolutionary way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here&amp;#8217;s to you Paul Simon (now I feel like I&amp;#8217;m channeling Jian Ghomeshi&amp;#8217;s)  for being a man of integrity, willing to joyfully flaunt your principles in the face of a challenge. Whether you think he was right or wrong, you gotta respect someone who goes forward instead of backward when put under siege.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out Simon performing in Zimbabwe in 1987 where thousands of South Africans crossed the border to revel in Paul Simon&amp;#8217;s triumphant, musical revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Louis CK on marketing metrics.</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/louis-ck-on-marketing-metrics/"/>
   <updated>2013-01-12T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/louis-ck-on-marketing-metrics</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The comedian Louis CK has a gift for telling it straight. Turns out he also has a knack for marketing strategy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said to [my agent], “Let’s do none of it.” … “Let’s find out if this is a huge mistake. Let’s find out. I’m willing to sacrifice my first theater tour and have the places empty and identify that it’s because I wouldn’t let the radio people participate. But we also might find out that it didn’t make a difference and that I never have to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All great marketers know that marketing is like science–there&amp;#8217;s no failure, only learning. The trick is to learn from every effort in a manner that can inform further decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great lesson is that while you don&amp;#8217;t always want to reinvent the wheel, you also don&amp;#8217;t have to use everyone else&amp;#8217;s playbook. So many organizations have been fed a diet of media buying and advertising that they think that it&amp;#8217;s all that&amp;#8217;s on the menu. It&amp;#8217;s not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cynical me sees this approach ranging from lazy to ass-covering (can&amp;#8217;t get in trouble for doing what everyone else does).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw Louis CK in Toronto this year. We all laughed our asses off, but I get an especially warm feeling inside knowing that he sells out entire tours without traditional advertising, because he learned that he could by trying it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are you going to learn from your next marketing effort?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/fun-stuff/10347/why-im-a-horrible-boss-and-how-i-plan-to-change/attachment/screen-shot-2013-01-11-at-2-15-53-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-10351&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-10351&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2013-01-11 at 2.15.53 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-shot-2013-01-11-at-2.15.53-PM.png&quot; width=&quot;499&quot; height=&quot;134&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/fun-stuff/10347/why-im-a-horrible-boss-and-how-i-plan-to-change/attachment/screen-shot-2013-01-11-at-2-05-48-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-10348&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not the &amp;#8220;official&amp;#8221; boss at Hypenotic. The bald guy at the big desk gets that honour. But I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; the boss of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, you may not be the boss of some big important company like Hypenotic. But I can assure you that you are the boss of your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.danpink.com/books/drive&quot;&gt;Dan Pink&amp;#8217;s Drive,&lt;/a&gt; I have to admit I&amp;#8217;m doing a pretty poor job of being the boss of me and I&amp;#8217;ve either got to fire myself (but who would replace me?) or give myself a serious review and make some changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premise of Pink&amp;#8217;s book is the management world needs a new operating system that reflects what science figured out long ago; Thinking, creative people need more than money to get them to do good work. People want to be self directed, experience the joy of mastering skills and see that they&amp;#8217;re connected to a higher purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By adopting a management style that allows for mastery, autonomy and purpose, Pink argues, you create &amp;#8220;conditions for people to do their best work.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I ask myself: &amp;#8220;As the boss of myself, do I create the conditions for me to do my best work?&amp;#8221; No sir, I do not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autonomy, according to Pink is the essential to the new management model. In short Pink tells us to stop using management as a euphemism for &amp;#8220;controlling people&amp;#8221; and instead use it as a tool to &amp;#8220;reawaken&amp;#8221; employees&amp;#8217; &amp;#8220;deep-seated sense of autonomy.&amp;#8221; For Pink, autonomy means &amp;#8220;acting with choice.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the boss of Jodi Incorporated, I don&amp;#8217;t act with much choice. I rarely unglue my butt from the chair to get a glasses of water, I often avoid fraternizing with my co-workers for hours on end because of self imposed time pressures. In short, even though I&amp;#8217;m in a fun, dynamic workplace I&amp;#8217;m stuck in an old management style where I treat myself as a  &amp;#8220;human resource&amp;#8221; rather than human being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What will it take for me to become a better boss? Here are a few ideas, but I&amp;#8217;m looking to you for more:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;I will go for walks.&lt;/strong&gt; I will remove the imaginary seat belt that keeps me tied to this desk chair and I will go outside and breathe oxygen. Sometimes I will come back with herbal tea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;I will drink water.&lt;/strong&gt; The problem with drinking water is that it&amp;#8217;s such a huge time suck. You not only have to walk the 20 feet to the sink, but then afterwards you have to go to pee. It&amp;#8217;s such a drag. But I find I get some of my best ideas in the quiet of the bathroom stall. I will use that as my excuse to drink more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;I will work from the Gladstone&lt;/strong&gt;. It may just be the caffeine, but I swear I&amp;#8217;m out-of-my-mind-happy when I decide to work outside the office . I am so productive it&amp;#8217;s crazy. Why do I make myself toil away at my desk when I don&amp;#8217;t have to? I&amp;#8217;m liberating myself to leave this place and go to my favorite café down the road. Once a week at least.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how about you? Are you a good boss when it comes to running your own show or do you need to modernize your work style when it comes to being the boss of yourself? I&amp;#8217;m seriously looking for some ideas here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Management&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Group of Seven Artist Just Hanging Out at Cranberry Lake: Ontario Lakes Project</title>

   <updated>2013-01-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/group-of-seven-artist-just-hanging-out-at-cranberry-lake-ontario-lakes-project</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-10340&quot; alt=&quot;CranberryLake&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/CranberryLake-580x392.png&quot; width=&quot;406&quot; height=&quot;274&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  Artist Franklin Carmichael, a member of the Group of Seven has much to teach us about how to live life.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  Carmichael&amp;#8217;s painting of Cranberry Lake (1936) is a living example of the fact that you don&amp;#8217;t have to make painful &amp;#8220;tradeoffs&amp;#8221; to have a successful life. Do you know the story about putting the &lt;a href=&quot;http://michaelhyatt.com/put-the-big-rocks-in-first.html&quot;&gt;big rocks in first&lt;/a&gt;? The idea is that if you don&amp;#8217;t put set aside time to attend to the real priorities in your life (let&amp;#8217;s say family, friends, etc.), there&amp;#8217;s a good chance you&amp;#8217;ll never get around to them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears that this was a concept that Franklin Carmichael understood and lived by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ago.net/cranberry-lake&quot;&gt;Art Gallery of Ontario describes him&lt;/a&gt; in the following way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carmichael did not feel the need to paint the Arctic or Rocky Mountains as the other members did. He was a devoted family man and could not explore to the same degree as the other members. Much of his work revolves around Ontario. However, biographers also note that he was never upset with this reality, he embraced it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We Ontarians love our lakes (and cottages) because connecting to nature reminds us of what&amp;#8217;s important. It seems Carmichael never forgot. Perhaps this is why he is &amp;#8220;lesser known&amp;#8221; among the seven and was absent from the famous &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/imgres?um=1&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;sa=N&amp;amp;tbo=d&amp;amp;biw=1422&amp;amp;bih=740&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;tbnid=ZYoE5_vGdKDvCM:&amp;amp;imgrefurl=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/group-of-seven&amp;amp;docid=jAQUti8VaoncLM&amp;amp;imgurl=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/media/group-of-seven-members-6550.jpg&amp;amp;w=400&amp;amp;h=245&amp;amp;ei=9S_vUKv4J_Sw0AHFxoDYBQ&amp;amp;zoom=1&amp;amp;iact=hc&amp;amp;vpx=4&amp;amp;vpy=196&amp;amp;dur=2888&amp;amp;hovh=175&amp;amp;hovw=286&amp;amp;tx=82&amp;amp;ty=80&amp;amp;sig=103396232553489911636&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;tbnh=153&amp;amp;tbnw=243&amp;amp;start=0&amp;amp;ndsp=30&amp;amp;ved=1t:429,r:0,s:0,i:84&quot;&gt;1920 picture of the group taken at Toronto&amp;#8217;s Arts &amp;amp; Letters Club. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to imagine he was busy hanging out on a hammock surrounded by his family at his cabin on Cranberry Lake while the other six were having their photo taken.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The ultimate change hack for 2013</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/the-ultimate-change-hack-for-2013/"/>
   <updated>2013-01-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/the-ultimate-change-hack-for-2013</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I call it being &amp;#8216;consciously deliberate&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s about being mindful of the pressures that inform our decisions, at whatever level. For example, this year, while visiting shipping our kids down to Florida for time with both sets of their grandparents, I didn&amp;#8217;t feel compelled to look for a single sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually pop out at least boxing day to find a blazer or something at a third of the regular cost. This year, I was simply too conscious of where things come from and what it takes to get them to me at that price for the price allure to influence. I didn&amp;#8217;t go shopping once. Instead, I&amp;#8217;m now going to have to figure out how to find clothes made in Canada (or close) with ethically sourced materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a productivity level, you can look at these pragmatic ideas for &lt;a href=&quot;http://mikerooney.rowk.com/?p=32&quot; title=&quot;Putting email in it&amp;#39;s place by Mike Rooney&quot;&gt;putting email in its&lt;/a&gt; place by Mike Rooney. They should help you avoid the urge to check email like you&amp;#8217;re the head surgeon somewhere during a pandemic so you can stop interrupting the flow the actually important work you&amp;#8217;re doing when email calls. The big ideas in it are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Turn off all email notifications (in case you still use a notifier for some reason)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Don’t check email when you can’t process it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Aggregate non-urgent emails with Use Unroll.me (compiles repeat emails int a single folder)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Batch Email with Inbox Pause (manually turn on email reception when you need it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in perhaps the coolest example of a deliberate choice to make the world a better place, I think you&amp;#8217;ll enjoy this piece about a man who moved in with his parents for a year so he could give up his house to someone who needs it more.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>I Predict You Will Change</title>

   <id>http://getpoole.com/i-predict-you-will-change</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/fun-stuff/10309/i-predict-you-will-change/attachment/screen-shot-2013-01-05-at-4-28-42-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-10322&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-10322&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2013-01-05 at 4.28.42 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-05-at-4.28.42-PM.png&quot; width=&quot;415&quot; height=&quot;311&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think back 15 years. Who were you? Have you changed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was 27 and I lived in Pittsburgh where I was pursuing my PhD.  I feel like an entirely different person from the one I was then. Chances are you feel much the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you knew you would change just as much in the next 15 years as you have in the past 15? In my case, I could expect to look back at my 42 year old self from the ripe old age of 67 with a grin, realizing how much life experience has shaped the person I became and how terribly naive I was way back then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/science/study-in-science-shows-end-of-history-illusion.html?_r=0&quot;&gt;New research from Harvard suggests&lt;/a&gt; that while people &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; that they&amp;#8217;ve changed considerably when looking back 15 years, they&amp;#8217;re likely to underestimate how much they&amp;#8217;ll change in the future. As one of the researchers Daniel T. Gilbert says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What we never seem to realize is that our future selves will look back and think the very same thing about us. At every age we think we’re having the last laugh, and at every age we’re wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s called the &amp;#8220;End of History Effect&amp;#8221; whereby people tend to predict that their personalities will be static in the future, even though experience has shown them that change happens all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would knowing that your future self will be radically different from your current self liberate you to accept uncertainty, growing pains and life experiences as inevitable, natural and therefore good?  If change is as natural as breathing why do we resist it so much? Why does it have to be so painful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m attempting an experiment. Starting today I&amp;#8217;m going to try to flip the End-Of-History Effect on its head and rename it the Start-Of-History Effect where I accept each day as one step toward my yet to be determined future self. The experiment will end when I&amp;#8217;m 67 and so much wiser than I am today. Care to join me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Lance Armstrong, Walmart and Rob Ford Need Coaching in 2013</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/lance-armstrong-walmart-and-rob-ford-need-coaching-in-2013/"/>
   <updated>2012-12-30T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/lance-armstrong-walmart-and-rob-ford-need-coaching-in-2013</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/10300/lance-armstrong-walmart-and-rob-ford-need-coaching-in-2013/attachment/screen-shot-2012-12-30-at-10-17-50-am&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-10302&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10302&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2012-12-30 at 10.17.50 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-30-at-10.17.50-AM.png&quot; width=&quot;546&quot; height=&quot;339&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I saw someone wearing the once ubiquitous &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livestrong.org/&quot;&gt;Livestrong &lt;/a&gt;logo and began contemplating Lance Armstrong&amp;#8217;s spectacular fall from grace. A fall so dramatic, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/23/sunday-times-suing-lance-armstrong-libel-case_n_2355751.html&quot;&gt;the UK newspaper that gave Armstrong a settlement&lt;/a&gt; for &amp;#8220;phoney&amp;#8221; doping allegations is now turning around and suing him for all the settlement money back, plus interest, plus the costs incurred defending the case. It&amp;#8217;s pretty humiliating stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now turn your mind to another stubborn refusal to accept responsibility. Today, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/06/world/asia/3-walmart-suppliers-made-goods-in-bangladeshi-factory-where-112-died-in-fire.html&quot;&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt; is reporting that documents from the Bangladeshi apparel factory where 112 people died by fire less than a month ago indicate that Walmart played&amp;#8230;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;The lead role in blocking an effort to have global retailers pay more for apparel to help Bangladesh factories improve their electrical and fire safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
  According to the article, retrieved corporate minutes taken during meetings in 2011 show that Walmart&amp;#8217;s Director of Ethical Sourcing concluded that improvements in fire and electrical safety in their 4500 Bangladesh factories would be a  “very extensive and costly modification&amp;#8221; and that &amp;#8220;it is not financially feasible for the brands to make such investments.” Kinda makes you wonder what the Director of Ethical Sourcing actually does with his time?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its official corporate statement &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.walmart.com/news-archive/2012/11/26/walmart-statement-on-fire-at-bangladesh-garment-factory&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Walmart claimed&lt;/a&gt; the fire was the result of a rogue supplier that acted &amp;#8220;in direct violation of our policies.&amp;#8221; Walmart attempted to scrub themselves clean of conspiracy but of course (as Armstrong found out) denial, denial and more denial cannot change a lie to the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could list a number of other examples of chronic deniers who arrogantly maintain innocence at their own peril. Anybody heard of Rob Ford?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long and the short is that brands that fail to own up and take responsibility to fans, suppliers and citizens are being called to task and shamed for their lack of accountability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over my winter vacation I&amp;#8217;ve been reading the latest edition of the classic coaching handbook &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Coaching-Performance-Potential-Principles-Leadership/dp/185788535X&quot;&gt;Coaching for Performance: Growing Human Potential and Performance&lt;/a&gt;. Its author john Whitmore is an early pioneer in the coaching profession. The premise of Whitmore&amp;#8217;s approach is that coaches don&amp;#8217;t teach, tell or dictate–they empower others to make choices, take responsibility and have personal control over their decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 4th edition of his book he dedicates a whole chapter to the current &amp;#8220;crisis of meaning&amp;#8221; ahead and what leaders need to do to address the &amp;#8220;unsettling waves of change&amp;#8221; evidenced by climate change, economic uncertainty and communities in crisis. Whitmore believes that it&amp;#8217;s no coincidence that coaching has risen just in time to help us address the challenges ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could it be that the coaching profession has emerged and grown so fast in only 25 years because it meets the broader need for self-responsibility, which, after all, is its principal product? Could the coaching profession have emerged to help midwife a new era?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-responsibility (and not phoney apologies) is emerging as a new normal. This leaves  brands like Rob Ford, Lance Armstrong and Walmart looking like stodgy old school power mongers and that&amp;#8217;s just not attractive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brands try very hard to seem youthful, or at least currently relevant. No one willingly ascribes the personality &amp;#8220;old man&amp;#8221; to their brand (not even Depends). Walmart has Old Navy as competition. And even though Old Navy or Joe Fresh may not be any more ethical, it was Walmart that was called out and has so far reacted very badly. Walmart will bear the brunt of criticism, but these other brands had better take note. You can&amp;#8217;t seem young, hip and fun if you&amp;#8217;re acting like a stubborn, crusty, greedy grandpa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s hope that some of these greedy grandpas get the memo in 2013 and get themselves a coach and a healthy dose of self-responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Resolution. Drink (actually) Canadian Beer</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/resolution-drink-actually-canadian-beer/"/>
   <updated>2012-12-29T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/resolution-drink-actually-canadian-beer</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Google made a charming video out of things people searched for in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also let you zero in on search trends by country. A casual browse of Canadian searches turned up what you&amp;#8217;d expect for many topics, but one stuck out in a sad way that I hope we can correct in 2013: Beer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-29-at-10.47.11-AM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10295&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2012-12-29 at 10.47.11 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-29-at-10.47.11-AM.png&quot; width=&quot;326&quot; height=&quot;334&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you spot the Canadian beer on the list? There&amp;#8217;s only one. Moosehead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the others are owned by massive foreign multinationals, which is a problem for a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  First of all, they create the illusion of choice–Sleeman is owned by Sapporo, but the rest are owned by the big two; Anheuser-Busch and MillerCoors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Like any factory commodity, their goal is to get away with the cheapest product they can&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The money may pay a few salaries and some rent, but the bulk of their wealth leaves the region they&amp;#8217;re brewed. So while you think you&amp;#8217;re proudly supporting a Canadian venture, you&amp;#8217;re doing it a lot less than if you found a beer owned by people near you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this is a tricky topic because the relationships between these beers and their owners are varied. Many haven&amp;#8217;t changed recipes, so if you loved something local, I understand that can be tricky. And I&amp;#8217;m not here to tell you what to do. My only interest is in leveling the playing field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These companies are spending untold fortunes on marketing to convince existing and prospective beer drinkers that what they&amp;#8217;re selling is the definition of beer. And it&amp;#8217;s not. A lot of it is yellow swill marketed to kids using boobs, tropes like geography and inanity like temperature or smoothness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And many fine folks making things near you have all the cards stacked against them. In Ontario, for example, the only place we can buy beer (besides going directly to breweries) is in &amp;#8220;Beer Stores&amp;#8221; owned by these same multinationals. Talk about the wolves guarding the hen-house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would it take for 2013&amp;#8242;s list of most searched for Canadian Beers to actually be Canadian brands?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would it take to make the same thing happen in your industry?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#8217;t seen it yet, but in my research around this topic, I came across &lt;a title=&quot;Beer Wars Movie&quot; href=&quot;http://beerwarsmovie.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Beer Wars,&lt;/a&gt; the movie I&amp;#8217;ll be watching tonight with a local craft beer in hand. Here&amp;#8217;s the trailer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in case it interests you, here&amp;#8217;s a comprehensive (but not exhaustive) list of &lt;a title=&quot;Big Brewer owned Brands&quot; href=&quot;http://brookstonbeerbulletin.com/the-big-brewers-brands/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;who owns what Beer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>We stopped dreaming</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/we-stopped-dreaming/"/>
   <updated>2012-12-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/we-stopped-dreaming</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Came across this video containing a series of ideas by superstar astrophysicist Neil Degrasse Tyson and I was inspired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought the historical narrative that NASA&amp;#8217;s drive to the moon was predicated on tactical positioning–higher ground in the US/Russian arms race, right away. And I also accepted that whatever the driver, dreaming about the unknown created an era in which imagination knew no bounds. People were inspired to become scientists because it was the path to the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was struck by how many people were white in the video, but I know there are several reasons for that. The thing that nagged at me was Gil Scott-Heron&amp;#8217;s poem from that era, &amp;#8220;Whitey on the Moon&amp;#8221;, which points out how absurd it seems to be sending people into space when we have problems we need to address right here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran the Tyson video by Jodi and she felt the same way, more strongly. We netted our discussion out at the idea that it would be neat if there was a NASA for Earth. An organization funded to imagine and address our most insurmountable issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;#8217;s the thing. The person who uploaded the Whitey on the Moon to Youtube in 2008 left this comment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A humorous little poem by the great Gil Scott-Heron. Lets see if president Obama will reorganize and re-prioritize the spending of taxpayers dollars. Will food, Shelter and Other social issues take precedence over the military industrial complex and Moon Rocks.&lt;br&gt;
We Shall See!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it changed my mind. Here&amp;#8217;s why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve been working with an amazing social justice agency called PARC for a little while now. They&amp;#8217;re Parkdale&amp;#8217;s (the neighbourhood Hypenotic is in) largest employer, and they offer food, shelter, and a range of other services to a community of members who have been systematically marginalized for many years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason PARC is awesome is that they&amp;#8217;ve realized that though food and shelter are critical to survival, survival is a pretty low bar. Imagine your motivation for waking up and getting going each day was survival, instead of inspiration, passion, connection, faith, responsibility, etc? How long could you do it? Isn&amp;#8217;t it security, support, friends, hobbies, meaningful work, etc that make life worth living?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARC offers a range of services, approaches and programs that treat members as people, not conditions. They have a weekly music jam with some serious (and seriously passionate) musicians. A reading series, sports (like hockey), etc. Activities that help people with conditions that we all suffer from to some degree (mental illness, addiction, poverty) transcend their circumstances through moments that make us feel alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SO, the pendulum came back for me. Yes, we need to spend more money addressing issues that divide us based on our circumstances. But I&amp;#8217;m thinking to do that, we might need to do a bit of big dreaming again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>12 Reasons to shop local for the holidays</title>

   <updated>2012-12-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/12-reasons-to-shop-local-for-the-holidays</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last June, in a post titled &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9302/where-we-draw-the-line&quot; title=&quot;New Directions for Hypenotic post&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;New Directions for Hypenotic&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;, I explained how our experience at the BALLE conference had refocussed our mission from manifesting a more sustainable economy to helping manifest a more generative economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve continued to work with organizations that foster good things like MaRS (especially the Centre for Impact Investing), PARC, Toronto Public Health, et al, but we&amp;#8217;ve taken a new step in our commitment to the city of Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s short notice but the group who met at the conference is piloting a &amp;#8220;Local First Campaign&amp;#8221; and we&amp;#8217;ve created an infographic listing some stats around the benefits of shopping local.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the (not to be underestimated) returns of buying from people with a &lt;a title=&quot;Move over Industrial Era. Make Room for the artisanal era.&quot; href=&quot;http://hypn.tc/R2hidv&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;care for craft&lt;/a&gt;, there are plenty of verified long term financial and quality of life returns that come from buying from a neighbour.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Hidden business metrics</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/hidden-business-metrics/"/>
   <updated>2012-12-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/hidden-business-metrics</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every day at the mailbox bank at our office I dump a few pieces of junk mail into the blue-bin that Jeff, our kind Super leaves there for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see the flavours of the day–gym offers, Dell brochures, crappy office-furniture, some take-out menus etc and think about their tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that direct marketing is a numbers game. They hit enough people enough times and all the concepts, layouts, paper, printing and delivery costs eventually pay off when some sucker joins the gym. I get it it, intellectually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it occurred to me one day after a few years of following this ritual that there&amp;#8217;s one metric the numbers geeks in direct mail probably missed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if every time I throw out my mail, in the infinite heartbeat it takes to float between my hand and the recycler, while I&amp;#8217;m catching that eyeful of all the discarded direct pieces, I&amp;#8217;m building a slight degree of aversion. Even a minuscule increment adds up eventually–Hypenotic has been around since &amp;#8217;98.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m wondering if they measure reverse impressions. If it matters to them that, instead of chipping away, this tactic is eating away. What if repeatedly sending me mail I didn&amp;#8217;t ask for after having procured my name from a list I didn&amp;#8217;t sign up to is slowly but surely building a revulsion for these brands?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if, instead of starting at neutral and coaxing me through a funnel that ends in sales, loyalty and evangelism, the opposite happens?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know if the Direct Mail industry assesses whether their targets are not only not converting, but actively working against them, solely because of the repeated mail they send them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just wondering.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Canadian Food Summit Challenges and Opportunities</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/canadian-food-summit-challenges-and-opportunities/"/>
   <updated>2012-12-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/canadian-food-summit-challenges-and-opportunities</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I spent the middle of a week last February at the &amp;#8220;Canadian Food Summit&amp;#8221; with about 600 participants (anecdotally) made up of 75% food sector business interests and 25% food sector social interest groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event was billed as a forum for discussion about a &amp;#8216;Canadian food strategy&amp;#8217;, including perceived next steps. Many interesting points were made, but the initiative could benefit from the following considerations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3 Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #800000;&quot;&gt;1. The name&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event didn&amp;#8217;t represent anyone&amp;#8217;s idea of a cross-section of Canadians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#8217;t about &amp;#8216;Food&amp;#8217;, it was about a type of food business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it certainly wasn&amp;#8217;t a summit. I looked it up. Every definition alludes to &amp;#8216;a meeting of leaders&amp;#8217;. This event was long on presentations, short on discussion, and ALMOST entirely led by a limited slice of the food interest pie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could have been more appropriately called the &amp;#8220;Food &lt;em&gt;Business&lt;/em&gt; Summit&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Conference board of Canada should know better. It&amp;#8217;s not a far leap to go from recognizing the poor name of this summit to considering the credibility of it&amp;#8217;s forum, the &amp;#8216;Conference Board of Canada&amp;#8217; itself. Who are they? How do they represent Canadians? I didn&amp;#8217;t vote for them. I&amp;#8217;m Canadian. Can I have my country&amp;#8217;s name back? What&amp;#8217;s it take to get a vanity plate like that anyway, lots of money? Will they just hand them out to anyone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or is this grandiose naming business a rhetorical device I&amp;#8217;m just late to the game on? Well it&amp;#8217;s worth mentioning that I WILL consider their application for membership when I start the &amp;#8216;Conference Board of the UNIVERSE&amp;#8217; (brand style guide will guarantee use of upper-case so we all recognize that it officially super-cedes theirs) and kick off the &amp;#8216;Milky Way Galaxy Food Strategy Summit&amp;#8217;. The table will be a big one, representing many interests, but one goal–healthy, accessible food for all, sourced sustainably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #800000;&quot;&gt;2. The approach&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;#8217;t solve problems by using the same thinking we used when we created them&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~ Albert Einstein&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Framing the problem in a way that uniquely positions your enterprise (and peers) as the solution is the kind of approach that makes an actual food strategy necessary. It&amp;#8217;s a free market approach that excludes people with critical perspectives and expertise who belong at a table about feeding people. We need Health, Sustainability and Food Security experts as well as industry voices for any process that genuinely wants to use the words &amp;#8216;Food&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;Strategy&amp;#8217; in it&amp;#8217;s title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Galen Weston&amp;#8217;s opening presentation used rhetorical devices that start the conversation in the wrong place. A growing population and a need to support big business are a false dichotomy. White bread may be profitable, but it won&amp;#8217;t address hunger in any sustainable way. And generating profit through empty-calorie fare marketed to ignorant, harried adults and vulnerable children externalizes their costs to our health car system, health and culture–anyone know how to cook any more?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #800000;&quot;&gt;3. The goal&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;A problem well stated is a problem half solved&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~ Charles F. Kettering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The western world is delicately weathering a financial crisis rooted in irresponsible instruments and practices that take people out of the equation. What got us here won&amp;#8217;t get us where we need to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  Maple Leaf Foods President and CEO Michael McCain&amp;#8217;s brand of Kool-aid  suggested that strong corporations and more hot dogs would solve our problems. He came off like a Simpson&amp;#8217;s character. A trope. He said what we expected him to say, which was oddly comforting.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Galen&amp;#8217;s presentation was more dangerous because he seems to have made a genuine effort to pull the wool over our eyes. He discussed the benefits to Canadians of economic strategies like cornering markets on specific products to make us more resilient. The discussions were red herrings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They ARE good strategies, if your goal is a healthy bottom line. Less so if your goal is healthy waistlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Opportunities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #800000;&quot;&gt;Partnership&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Environmental, health, food sector and hunger advocates can agree on one thing; things aren&amp;#8217;t going to change overnight. Most of the dynamic leaders and change agents I know are pragmatists seeking incremental change, so why not work with them? The halo effect might obscure some of the (expected but still icky) murky, shadowy grabbiness the current approach is conveying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #800000;&quot;&gt;Reform&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a &amp;#8216;big tent&amp;#8217; approach to food system reform that sees a role for all. Even organizations who&amp;#8217;s current model is predicated on margins at the expense of others (through externalities that show up on public balance sheets like health-care and the environment) can play a part. As long as they&amp;#8217;re open to shifting their role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #800000;&quot;&gt;Brand strategy&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously. Imagine the few companies that control most of what ends up on grocery store shelves in Canada took a genuine interest in addressing nutrition, food security (access to good food) and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure they&amp;#8217;d have to give up a boat-load in easier money by selling less crap, but that could be more than off-set in marketing cost savings–EVERYONE would be on their side. We&amp;#8217;d do the selling for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this is a different business model, but there&amp;#8217;s something enticing about the challenge isn&amp;#8217;t there?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Move over industrial era. Make room for the artisanal era.</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/move-over-industrial-era-make-room-for-the-artisanal-era/"/>
   <updated>2012-12-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/move-over-industrial-era-make-room-for-the-artisanal-era</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Microsofts new responsive website&quot; href=&quot;http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; has gone &lt;a title=&quot;Nishant Kothari tells the story of the new Microsoft.com&quot; href=&quot;http://rainypixels.com/words/the-story-of-the-new-microsoft-com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;responsive&lt;/a&gt;. They employed a three person team called &lt;a title=&quot;Paravel Agency website&quot; href=&quot;http://paravelinc.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Paravel&lt;/a&gt; with a care for craft. In the most traditional sense–if there were a guild of web designers, Paravel would be in it, because they&amp;#8217;ve been sharing and improving the craft as they&amp;#8217;ve moved ahead with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are more restaurants with themes, missions and codes within walking distance of my house than I can get to before I retire and have significantly more free time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s &lt;a title=&quot;Make Magazine website&quot; href=&quot;http://makezine.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Make&lt;/a&gt; magazine, &lt;a title=&quot;Maker Faire website&quot; href=&quot;http://makerfaire.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;maker faires&lt;/a&gt;, and one of a kind shows riding on the currents of DIY and Craft movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 37 Farmer&amp;#8217;s markets in Toronto. The concept is becoming more mainstream. They&amp;#8217;re popping up where people work and play, loaded with artisans and producers who bring a stewardship approach to their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typography is making it&amp;#8217;s way back into the mainstream as new technologies allow for the use of more typefaces online, and awareness of how to manipulate it intelligently and creatively spreads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slow Food Toronto is campaigning to get people to &lt;a title=&quot;Slow Food Toronto&#39;s terra Madre Day&quot; href=&quot;http://slowfood.to/events/terra-madre-day-2012-made-from-scratch/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cook from scratch&lt;/a&gt; for this year&amp;#8217;s Terra Madre Day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s way old news that &lt;a title=&quot;Hypenotic article about Urban Outfitter ripping off Etsy designs &quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/5478/etsy-vs-urban-outfitters-what-does-it-say-about-us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Urban Outfitters imitates Etsy artists&lt;/a&gt;, and when mass fashion imitates ironic internet crafters, you know craft is going mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The no bullshit Green Party of Ontario is trying to help &lt;a title=&quot;Green Party of Ontario Website&quot; href=&quot;http://www.gpo.ca/media-release/break-foreign-beer-store-monopoly-and-support-local-craft-breweries&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;break the foreign-owned Beer Store monopoly&lt;/a&gt; so that a healthy craft beer industry can grow to serve local economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short–I know the title is hyperbolic. We&amp;#8217;ll always have big industry for certain things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#8217;s apparent and refreshing to note that in big cities and via the internet, it&amp;#8217;s getting easier to get your hands on that thing you care about. That bite, drink, toy, gift, hobby, indulgence, tool or widget that you know something about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one that sounds, tastes, feels, looks or smells better because someone sourced just the right ingredients, components or materials. The one with details you&amp;#8217;ll appreciate for a long time to come because someone spent more time on it. The one that feels better to give because of the story attached to it. The one you&amp;#8217;ll keep because it connects you to a person, place, sensation or sensibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an era of polarizing ideologies and politics, I think we&amp;#8217;re seeing a polarization of consumerism. We&amp;#8217;ve been trained to consume over the last 50 years and the itch doesn&amp;#8217;t stay scratched for long. Yet the repeated and pervasive hollowness of increasingly disposable stuff is affecting the nature of our yearning. Consumption isn&amp;#8217;t enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of stories, this is the 5th anniversary of &lt;a title=&quot;The Story of Stuff Website&quot; href=&quot;http://www.storyofstuff.org/movies-all/story-of-stuff/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the Story of Stuff&lt;/a&gt;. Now up to their eighth production, few organizations have done more to help us understand why wanton consumption is worse than just unfulfilling. If you haven&amp;#8217;t seen it, start here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do yourself a favour for the holidays. Screw convenience and find the time to buy meaningful gifts (whatever that means to you). Try to stop your company from sending out holiday cards and calendars that go straight in the recycler (at best).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have to do something promotional, buy sweatshop free gifts from B Corps like &lt;a title=&quot;Fairware&quot; href=&quot;http://www.fairware.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fairware&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&quot;Ecojot Website&quot; href=&quot;http://www.ecojot.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ecojot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&quot;Saul Good Gift Co&quot; href=&quot;http://www.itsaulgood.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Saul Good&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a title=&quot;Etsy.com&quot; href=&quot;http://www.etsy.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Etsy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s the expression?:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you buy something cheap and poorly made, the best you&amp;#8217;ll ever feel about it is the day you bought it. If you buy something pricer but well made, the worst you&amp;#8217;ll ever feel about it is the day you bought it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome artisanal era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Hey Obama: I will be outspent</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/hey-obama-i-will-not-be-outspent/"/>
   <updated>2012-12-07T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/hey-obama-i-will-not-be-outspent</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-10249 alignleft&quot; title=&quot;Barack Obama&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Barack-Obama.png&quot; alt=&quot;Barack Obama winking&quot; width=&quot;227&quot; height=&quot;168&quot; /&gt;I just read an interesting article on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-11-29/the-science-behind-those-obama-campaign-e-mails&quot; title=&quot;The science behind Obama&amp;#39;s emails&quot;&gt;how the Obama campaign raised funds in the last election&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the article, most came as the result of fund-raising emails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They rigorously tested the subject lines. The best were informal, conversational, almost personal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Hey (the most effective)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  I will be outspent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Would love to meet you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The one thing the polls got right&amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emails were extensively A-B split tested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We were so bad at predicting what would win that it only reinforced the need to constantly keep testing,” Amelia Showalter, director of digital analytics, is quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Headlines, copy, the amount asked for, all were rigorously written and re-written by a team of 20 writers. Then tested on small segments of the campaign&amp;#8217;s email list. The most successful would be sent to out to the whole list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may not have 20 writers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, the technology to measure and test whether what you write resonates with your community, educates and inspires and effectively moves you closer toward your organizational goals is available to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article illustrates the notion that your work is never &amp;#8216;done&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your website launch, your email blast, these are not events, but steps along a path. From which you&amp;#8217;ll learn, adapt, adjust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you been surprised by the response to your emails or your website? What lessons have you learned in the process? Please share below.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>SO Sorry! We need to redo your site.</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/so-sorry-we-need-to-redo-your-site/"/>
   <updated>2012-11-30T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/so-sorry-we-need-to-redo-your-site</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, not &amp;#8216;redo&amp;#8217;, but, you&amp;#8217;ll see what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know we launched it less than a year ago. I know it wasn&amp;#8217;t free, and that it took a lot of brain power, time and energy on both our ends. And I know you&amp;#8217;ll probably have a hard time getting a new budget from your CEO, VP, foundation, ED or whoever pays for these things. But it&amp;#8217;s necessary. Or it will be soon enough that I&amp;#8217;d start thinking about it now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d say that this disaster isn&amp;#8217;t entirely our fault. Of course you&amp;#8217;d expect me to say that since we built it. But if you can reserve judgement, let me tell you what happened before you decide who to blame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four things peaked this year, and they&amp;#8217;ve all led to some serious shifts in how we work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The internet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; How we interact with it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The amount of media we&amp;#8217;re consuming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; How we work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course they&amp;#8217;re all related, but some insight into the specifics of each are worth considering:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #800000;&quot;&gt;1. The internet&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are more people online, using more and higher bandwidth. Websites are basically applications, which sounds technical, but just mean they &amp;#8216;do things.&amp;#8217; The age of &amp;#8216;brochureware&amp;#8217; is pretty much over. Sure there will be noteworthy hold-overs–those who make beautiful standalone sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just the same as there are musical artists who still put out elaborate album art with shiny packaging and accompanying print materials. More power to them, I hope these art forms persist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is, young and old, comfortable and just learning, the internet is long past being a catalogues reference library. When you find your reference, the parts are moving, and we expect them to be. The internet is alive. And living things need care at multiple levels, from cellular to muscular, especially with regards to systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your site needs to be connected to something–an interest, a community–it needs fresh oxygen, some blood coursing through it, and some respect, or it will get sick and die. Not that there&amp;#8217;s anything wrong with that, it&amp;#8217;s just worth knowing, because if you&amp;#8217;re fortunate enough for people to interact with your website, you are creating impressions, specifically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #800000;&quot;&gt;2. How we interact with the internet&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DO leave your phone in your pocket when you get home from work or when you take the kids to the park (even if you&amp;#8217;re sitting on the bench watching). DO seek out local, physical community engagement (though finding and planning for it online will help). But also, DO be objective about the degree to which you use the web and the nature and conditions of  that interaction; your attention span, and experience expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve gone, and are increasingly going mobile. Though I remember getting my first mobile phone, and I can remember thinking I would never need to interact with the web via mobile, tehy&amp;#8217;re both faint, dreamlike memories, and still fading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some global or US centric mobile stats from September (cribbed from &lt;a title=&quot;The Social Skinny&quot; href=&quot;http://thesocialskinny.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the social skinny&lt;/a&gt;) for a clearer picture of how we&amp;#8217;re interacting with the web:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Mobile now accounts for 10% of internet usage worldwide (this has more than doubled over last 18months) (&lt;a href=&quot;http://thenextweb.com/mobile/2012/05/09/mobile-now-accounts-for-10-of-internet-usage-worldwide-double-that-of-2010-report/&quot;&gt;The Next Web&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;  7.96% of all web traffic in the U.S. is mobile traffic.

&lt;li&gt;  This equals &lt;strong&gt;87%&lt;/strong&gt; of the world’s population (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitalbuzzblog.com/infographic-2012-mobile-growth-statistics/?&quot;&gt;Source Digital Buzz Blog&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;  There are over &lt;strong&gt;1.2 Billion &lt;/strong&gt;people accessing the web from their mobiles (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitalbuzzblog.com/infographic-2012-mobile-growth-statistics/?&quot;&gt;Source Digital Buzz Blog&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Google earns &lt;strong&gt;2.5 Billion&lt;/strong&gt; in mobile ad revenue annually (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitalbuzzblog.com/infographic-2012-mobile-growth-statistics/?&quot;&gt;Source Digital Buzz Blog&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For better or for worse, we&amp;#8217;re spending a lot of time interacting with a lot of media, and the bulk of our expectations are being developed on other people&amp;#8217;s sites and more often than we&amp;#8217;d expect, on mobile platforms. We do not control the conventions, we adapt to them. We employ them skilfully if we&amp;#8217;re paying attention. We are. Are you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #800000;&quot;&gt;3. The amount of media people are consuming&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet is pervasive. It&amp;#8217;s a resource that cuts across virtually all our interestes, processing virtually any information–from ancient traditions like story-telling to modern applications like news and event sharing. And it&amp;#8217;s mobile–we can interact with it virtually anywhere. So it has become a relatively accepted element of our consciousness and culture. And it can be accessed almost anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not saying it&amp;#8217;s everything. It&amp;#8217;s not all important. Just that as the maker, owner, or beneficiary of the fruits of a website, it&amp;#8217;s important to know that the way we interact with websites, the keepers of all the information we access– has evolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this hyper-media saturated climate, signal to noise ratio must be considered at every level. Your site needs to be at least easy to look at, if not beautiful (and there are many forms of beauty).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It needs to be easy to interact with, so I go from context (can I do what I want here?) to action (reason I came) as intuitively and expediently as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These factors are not always the only considerations, but they&amp;#8217;re the convention. Sometimes, I take the crank-operated elevator at the Gladstone Hotel–it&amp;#8217;s neither intuitive nor expedient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, when he was around, I used to enjoy getting into chats with Hank, the Gladstone Cowboy–and though I was richer for the experience, I didn&amp;#8217;t leave any younger. But if I had to get into long conversations with country singers crank-operating beautiful but slow elevators every time I needed a lift, I&amp;#8217;d find more reasons to end up at ground floor meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My point is that while you should of course be chasing your customers/constituents instead of your competitors, failing to objectively consider and to try and factor in how people are being influenced by media today is a recipe for irrelevance. The vehicle matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #800000;&quot;&gt;4. How we work&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the way we see it, no website will ever be finished again. Nor should it be. &amp;#8220;Finished&amp;#8221; is for meals. For things you polish. For things made out of plastic. That come in styrofoam, cardboard and tape, bought at a big-box retailer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Websites are software. They&amp;#8217;re part of a system designed to generate at least insight, though many other returns are possible. They need to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  be launched earlier than you think,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  do less than you think&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  offer insight into clearly defined stakeholder goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  respect context–where their users came from and what they&amp;#8217;re expecting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  respect ecosystem–they&amp;#8217;re on the web, itself composed of scripts, protocols and algorithms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  be worked on and with, iteratively, always. You can go through lower intensity periods, where you&amp;#8217;re hypothesizing, but eventually you need to get back to testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we&amp;#8217;ll deliver a milestone called &amp;#8216;live&amp;#8217; and let the world see what we&amp;#8217;ve been designing, testing and tweaking. But we&amp;#8217;re never going to say it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;finished&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #800000;&quot;&gt;What this all means, to us, and our relationship.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember–I started this post with an apology:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Websites must be responsive&lt;/strong&gt;. Which means designed to reformat to offer a great experience at smaller screen sizes (like mobile) AND that we need to consider the context of these interactions. Do the same navigation and features make sense for people standing in line at the drugstore (for something trivial) as those sitting down at their office desk? We must now consider this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Websites must be constantly &amp;#8216;refactored&amp;#8217;.&lt;/strong&gt;User Experience, metrics and conversions, performance (and other things that can be improved by revisiting code), etc must be worked on regularly. A website it more like a pet than a toy. It needs, love, care and poop removal, not a home on a shelf, occasional visits followed by an eventual replacement with a more current, &amp;#8216;finished&amp;#8217; product. This sucks, because it means we need to completely re-imagine the service provider relationship.We&amp;#8217;ve always had a partnership approach, we only work with people we like doings that matter. But they/you get funded in &amp;#8216;budgets&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;grants&amp;#8217;. Each with relatively arbitrary deadlines and short term mandates. Even an in-house development team suffers from misperceptions and a lack of objectivity regarding the role a website plays for an organization and the relationship it demands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Less is more:&lt;/strong&gt; Most existing sites need to edit features and content. New ones should start with a minimum viable product and iterate, adding new functionality and content in a manner that allows for testing and improvement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Trust is the bottom line:&lt;/strong&gt; We know some old-school business types would feel safer with a contract that specifies what feature list we can be held to rather than a partner who you can look in the eye, talk about your problems with and who you know will go to the wall for you. They must be engaged. And there are an equal amount of executives who just need to be informed of the evolving, agile nature of digital project design, development and management for the web. Teach them. Employ them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, can we redo your site, always and forever? That would work best. For both of us.&lt;br&gt;
Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My wife won&#8217;t be lying down in front of a bulldozer</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/my-wife-wont-be-lying-down-in-front-of-a-bulldozer/"/>
   <updated>2012-11-25T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/my-wife-wont-be-lying-down-in-front-of-a-bulldozer</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, Jodi and I were invited to an event called &amp;#8220;Downstream Downtown&amp;#8221; by a coalition of partners opposed to the proposed development of an aggregate MegaQuarry in Melancthon, north west of the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project was tainted from the start:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The scale was off the charts–20 football fields of soil removed, and the proces essentially a science experiment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The soil in question is some of the best in the world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  It&amp;#8217;s located at a series of headwaters that supply water to over a million people, and, deeper than Niagara falls is high, would dig below the water table&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Run by  Massachusetts based Hedge Fund named the Baupost Group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Through a local organization who bought up prime land by posing as potato farmers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The Baupost Group hires Hill &amp;amp; Knowlton, a classic &amp;#8216;spin anyone/thing&amp;#8217; PR factory that casts a poor light on the industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the story unfolded and we became personally invested, I&amp;#8217;d hear Jodi describe it to people as the kind of thing you stand in front of a bulldozer for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the forces of good were never more than a step behind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  A farmer named Carl Cossack poked around and started asking questions, then rallying support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Teams organized in the region and in the city&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The group divided their outreach/awareness into communities of interest (Downtown Downstream was a focus on people aware of and interested in food issues, I was also invited to an event focussed on water issues)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  We went back to the office and made the NoMegaQuarry team a website and Infographic, and started teaching people about the issue ourselves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The Canadian Chef&amp;#8217;s Congress, led by local farmer/Celebrity Chef Michael Stadtlander organized a fund and awareness rally that drew 72 chefs, a range of awesome musicians and 20,000 people to Foodstock, a field and forest food and music fest in wind and rain (this should have been the first indication that Hill &amp;amp; Knowlton&amp;#8217;s PR machine was up against a project that Ontarians didn&amp;#8217;t want)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;   The day before the event, the Ontario Minister of the Environment called for an environmental assessment, delaying the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Fast forward to Soupstock a few weeks ago and the involvement of the David Suzuki Foundation–our pal Faisal got back to the foundations&amp;#8217; roots with a bit of rabble–rousing, to a crowd of 40K (over the course of the day)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Mid-week,in a masterfully understated press release, we got the news that the Baupost Group felt there wasn&amp;#8217;t enough support among locals or from the government, and that they were pulling the plug&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we first heard about the project, we went through the emotional range you&amp;#8217;d expect to when confronted with prospective large scale injustice we were helpless to address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we addressed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people did a lot of things, some little some big. All critical. We came face to face with a prospective greed-made environmental disaster. It was chilling and, truth be told, the result was surprising. I thought this was going to be fought for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess the lesson is that the only thing we know for sure is that if we didn&amp;#8217;t get involved–if people didn&amp;#8217;t put signs on their lawns, come out to events, tell their friends and pitch in their unique skills–we&amp;#8217;d never have won.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a beer at the office when the news broke. And look out for an official party in mid February. Then, it&amp;#8217;s back to work figuring out how to ensure that our best soil is saved for growing food, that our water is protected, and maybe that we put some of our ingenuity to use looking for modern takes on aggregate.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Lou Rosenfeld: 3 great UX Resources</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/lou-rosenfeld-3-great-ux-resources/"/>
   <updated>2012-11-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/lou-rosenfeld-3-great-ux-resources</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lou Rosenfeld (&lt;a title=&quot;Louis Rosenfeld on Twitter&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/louisrosenfeld&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@louisrosenfeld&lt;/a&gt;) is best-known for being co-author of &lt;a title=&quot;Amazon link to buy Information Architecture for the World Wide Web&quot; href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Information-Architecture-World-Wide-Web/dp/0596527349&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Information Architecture for the World Wide Web&lt;/a&gt; (O&amp;#8217;Reilly; 3rd edition, 2008), widely considered the &amp;#8220;bible of information architecture&amp;#8221;. But like a lot of information architects who get long in the tooth, he&amp;#8217;s found himself advising his clients–mostly Fortune 500s–on the more strategic aspects of making information findable. Or, put another way, &amp;#8220;information therapy&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In anticipation of Lou&amp;#8217;s upcoming 11/29 &lt;a href=&quot;http://rosenfeldmedia.com/workshops/adaptable-ia/&quot; title=&quot;Lou Rosenfeld Toronto Workshop details&quot;&gt;workshop in Toronto&lt;/a&gt; as part of our &lt;a title=&quot;User Experience Design Workshops in Toronto&quot; href=&quot;http://uxinto.ca/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UXinTO&lt;/a&gt; partnership, I asked him for 3-5 great resources that openend his mind to new approaches to User Experience Design. Here&amp;#8217;s his response:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Christian Rohrer&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;User Research Landscape&amp;#8221;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may not be the prettiest &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xdstrategy.com/2008/10/28/desirability_studies/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;diagram&lt;/a&gt;, but it&amp;#8217;s changed the way I think about user research, and I&amp;#8217;ve been using it in almost every presentation and client meeting ever since I encountered it.&lt;br&gt;
Christian has pulled together much of the canon of user research methods, and charts them along two axes&amp;#8211;qualitative/quantitative and behavioral/attitudinal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/design/10190/lou-rosenfeld-3-great-ux-resources/attachment/researchmethods3d1&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-10192&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-10192&quot; title=&quot;researchmethods3d1&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/researchmethods3d1-580x414.png&quot; alt=&quot;Christian Rohrer&#39;s &amp;quot;User Research Methods&amp;quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;414&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result not only reminds us to focus on methods beyond our favorites, but we also can learn how (im)balanced our overall user research regimen is. In other words, if you&amp;#8217;re using methods that are wholly of, say, the quantitative/behavioral quadrant, your insights will be quite biased and uneven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Gamestorming: A Playbook for Innovators&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Dave Gray, Sunni Brown, &amp;amp; James Macanufo (O&amp;#8217;Reilly, 2010)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate meetings; that&amp;#8217;s why I love &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Gamestorming-Playbook-Innovators-Rulebreakers-Changemakers/dp/0596804172&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt;. It uses game-based exercises to make meetings not only tolerable, but productive and&amp;#8211;get this&amp;#8211;enjoyable. I&amp;#8217;ve used many of its exercises when running client meetings; one of my favorites&amp;#8211;the &lt;a href=&quot;http://answers.oreilly.com/topic/1864-gamestorming-elevator-pitch/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;elevator pitch exercise&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8211;is available online for you to try out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;@rosenfeldmedia Twitter Account&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this sounds self-serving, but I curate tweets from the 63 UX experts associated with Rosenfeld Media&amp;#8211;our authors, consultants, and board members&amp;#8211;and retweet them from the @rosenfeldmedia account. Many of them are in turn retweeting posts from other great UX people. Between first and second-degrees of separation, that&amp;#8217;s a lot of UX goodness I get exposed to via the process of curation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to keep up with any subject, become a curator; and if you want to keep up with UX, you can benefit from my curation by following the &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/rosenfeldmedia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@rosenfeldmedia Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>I Learned to Lilly Dip on Lake Couchiching: Ontario Lakes Project</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-10182&quot; title=&quot;Couchiching&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Couchiching.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;297&quot; height=&quot;297&quot; /&gt;Lake Couchiching has a special place in my heart. I was a camper at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wahanowin.com/about&quot;&gt;Camp Wahanowin &lt;/a&gt;in Orillia Ontario from eight years old for five consecutive summers. Digging through the archives, I was pleased to discover that I had received an Achievement Award for Canoeing on &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Couchiching&quot;&gt;Lake Couchiching&lt;/a&gt; (that and an Award for Woodworking).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-10178 alignleft&quot; title=&quot;JodiCertificate&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/JodiCertificate-580x807.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;278&quot; height=&quot;387&quot; /&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-10179 alignleft&quot; title=&quot;Jodi&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Jodi-580x447.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;278&quot; height=&quot;214&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That Award must have been a charitable gift of sorts because I can assure you, I was not an enthusiastic canoeist. At best, I was a reluctant lily dipper. But all of these years later, I&amp;#8217;m touched that someone, somewhere, thought to give me an award for my efforts&amp;#8211;and of course for acknowledgement of my serious woodworking skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I didn&amp;#8217;t enjoy the temperature of Lake Couch, or being forced to swim laps with waves crashing into my face as I did &lt;em&gt;one more &lt;/em&gt;lap of the crawl across its shores, I loved Camp Wahanowin and the childhood experiences I had there. Because Lake Couch was part of that experience it will forever have a very special place in my heart.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Bailout of the People by the People</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/a-bailout-of-the-people-by-the-people-2/"/>
   <updated>2012-11-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/a-bailout-of-the-people-by-the-people-2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10158&quot; title=&quot;Rolling Jubilee&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Rolling-Jubilee3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;520&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debt is so ubiquitous, it&amp;#8217;s become invisible. It&amp;#8217;s just an inevitable part of &amp;#8220;owning&amp;#8221; a home or a car, funding our holiday shopping or getting an education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But debt can be a huge issue when it leads to foreclosures, bankruptcy and people basically losing their lives and their shirts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alarm bells have definitely started to sound here in Canada, but for our friends south of the border, things are much, much worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the US, student debt has topped $1 Trillion. 62% of all bankruptcies are caused by medical illness. What&amp;#8217;s even more startling is that the average American household has debts of around 154% their annual income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-10164 aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;American Debt &quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Screen-shot-2012-11-15-at-4.15.11-PM3-580x293.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;293&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter the People&amp;#8217;s Bailout: &lt;a href=&quot;http://rollingjubilee.org/&quot;&gt;The Rolling Jubilee&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rolling Jubilee—whose name stems from the biblical sense of the term &amp;#8220;Jubilee&amp;#8221;, meaning &amp;#8220;an event in which all debts are cancelled and all those in bondage are set free&amp;#8221;—has been organized by &lt;a href=&quot;http://strikedebt.org/&quot;&gt;Strike Debt&lt;/a&gt;, an offshoot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://occupywallst.org/&quot;&gt;Occupy Wall Street&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, banks sell debt for pennies on the dollar to debt buyers who then turn around and claim the full amount from debtors. The Rolling Jubilee is a project that hopes to abolish this practice, all the while dissolving the current debt crisis America is facing today in a totally unique and ground breaking way by using social crowd funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Together we can liberate debtors at random through a campaign of mutual support, good will, and collective refusal. Debt resistance is just the beginning. Join us as we imagine and create a new world based on the common good, not wall street profits.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rolling Jubilee is primarily focussing on social media as a means of spreading the word. There are links to tweet at specific celebrities who have a large following on the web, urging them to join the cause and tweet to the masses. There is also a Facebook and/or Twitter pledge that sends out a message once per day advertising the cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, The Rolling Jubilee has raised $381,772. That means that is has also abolished $7,640,258 of debt all while keeping banks and debt collectors at bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in participating, check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://rollingjubilee.org/&quot;&gt;rollingjubilee.org&lt;/a&gt; and join the cause.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lou Rosenfeld (&lt;a title=&quot;Louis Rosenfeld on Twitter&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/louisrosenfeld&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@louisrosenfeld&lt;/a&gt;) is best-known for being co-author of &lt;a title=&quot;Amazon link to buy Information Architecture for the World Wide Web&quot; href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Information-Architecture-World-Wide-Web/dp/0596527349&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Information Architecture for the World Wide Web&lt;/a&gt; (O&amp;#8217;Reilly; 3rd edition, 2008), widely considered the &amp;#8220;bible of information architecture&amp;#8221;.

Or, put another way, &amp;#8220;information therapy&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few tips that Lou will cover further in his 11/29 &lt;a href=&quot;http://rosenfeldmedia.com/workshops/adaptable-ia/&quot; title=&quot;Lou Rosenfeld Toronto Workshop details&quot;&gt;workshop in Toronto&lt;/a&gt; as part of our &lt;a title=&quot;User Experience Design Workshops in Toronto&quot; href=&quot;http://uxinto.ca/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UXinTO&lt;/a&gt; partnership; we hope you find it therapeutic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;1. &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  Your site is not a democracy.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/10103/work-with-large-sites-3-helpful-tips-by-lou-rosenfeld/attachment/monster-main&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-10106&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10106&quot; title=&quot;Monster-Main&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Monster-Main.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;380&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;If you plotted your site&amp;#8217;s documents from most visited (the &amp;#8220;short head&amp;#8221; on the left) to least (the &amp;#8220;long tail&amp;#8221; on the right), the drop off would be steep and dramatic–rather than evenly, &amp;#8220;democratically&amp;#8221; distributed. That means that a handful of your documents are REALLY IMPORTANT, and do most of the heavy lifting, while the rest are rarely visited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt; make sure those &amp;#8220;short head&amp;#8221; documents are the best-maintained, while investing less (or not at all) in the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bonus:&lt;/em&gt; these efforts won&amp;#8217;t cost you much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Double-bonus:&lt;/em&gt; same is true for lots of other things, like your site&amp;#8217;s search queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find and improve all short heads, and you&amp;#8217;ll dramatically improve your users&amp;#8217; experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;2.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  Ban the word &amp;#8220;redesign&amp;#8221; from your planning meetings.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your organization is considering a redesign, it&amp;#8217;s quite possible that it doesn&amp;#8217;t know what the hell it&amp;#8217;s doing. While your site really might suck, what problems does a redesign solve? If you&amp;#8217;re not performing diagnostics–figuring out why your site sucks–then it&amp;#8217;s impossible to know what to fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/10103/work-with-large-sites-3-helpful-tips-by-lou-rosenfeld/attachment/site_owner&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-10114&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10114&quot; title=&quot;site_owner&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/site_owner.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;486&quot; height=&quot;290&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s when familiar but meaningless crutch terms–like &amp;#8220;redesign&amp;#8221;–crop up: they fill a diagnostic vacuum without describing specific solutions. If you&amp;#8217;ve not diagnosed what&amp;#8217;s wrong–if you can&amp;#8217;t actually explain what&amp;#8217;s wrong in plain language–then your organization will find itself on the wrong end of a hugely expensive cosmetic facelift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/10103/work-with-large-sites-3-helpful-tips-by-lou-rosenfeld/attachment/design_agency&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-10116&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10116&quot; title=&quot;design_agency&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/design_agency.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;486&quot; height=&quot;290&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So prevent papering over the problems by banning the term &amp;#8220;redesign&amp;#8221; from your planning discussions. The short-term pain of talking through painful realities will lead to the long-term gain of getting important things actually fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;3.  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;Siloed user research will kill your company.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that your organization has finally drunk the Kool-Aid of user research, and is investing heavily in a usability lab. And an analytics team. And some ethnographers. And a Voice of the Customer group. And some outside firm to run Net Promoter Score studies. And some other agencies to do other kinds of user research. And.. And&amp;#8230; You can probably see the bad news coming: all those pockets of research are pretty useless if they&amp;#8217;re not synthesized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/10103/work-with-large-sites-3-helpful-tips-by-lou-rosenfeld/attachment/monster-2&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-10119&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10119&quot; title=&quot;Monster-2&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Monster-2.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;70&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in the fable of the blind men and the elephant, each of these approaches to getting at what users&amp;#8217; intentions and behaviors is narrow and incomplete. Unless you synthesize them–get researchers to connect their findings–your organization won&amp;#8217;t be achieving true insight.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Inside the Inside Label: A Comparison</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/inside-the-inside-label-a-comparison/"/>
   <updated>2012-11-09T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/inside-the-inside-label-a-comparison</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a snapshot of two different clothing labels I found on the inside of my 5 year olds&amp;#8217; clothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.patagonia.ca/&quot;&gt;Patagonia &lt;/a&gt;jacket I invested in to keep her warm all winter long. What does this label say to you? Here&amp;#8217;s a clue&amp;#8211;they expect the jacket to be handed down, so they offer two places for children&amp;#8217;s names to be written. (Can we all do a collective awwwwwwww!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/branding/10087/inside-the-inside-label-a-comparison/attachment/screen-shot-2012-11-09-at-9-31-26-am&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-10089&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-10089&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2012-11-09 at 9.31.26 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Screen-shot-2012-11-09-at-9.31.26-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;465&quot; height=&quot;378&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  The second is from a fancy-shmancy store, the new Lululemon kids&amp;#8217; store &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ivivva.com/&quot;&gt;Ivivva Athletica&lt;/a&gt; in Oakville that my darling mother (my kids&amp;#8217; granny)&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ivivva.com/&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;schlepped them to when were were on vacation, because she&amp;#8217;s a fashionista.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  What does this label tell you? And remember, it&amp;#8217;s a five year old&amp;#8217;s garment.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/branding/10087/inside-the-inside-label-a-comparison/attachment/screen-shot-2012-11-09-at-9-31-14-am-2&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-10090&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-10090&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2012-11-09 at 9.31.14 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Screen-shot-2012-11-09-at-9.31.14-AM1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;578&quot; height=&quot;344&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  Can you just picture my five year old on a hot pink glittery cell phone:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  Pippa: &amp;#8220;You mean the pink top? Yeah it&amp;#8217;s mine. I&amp;#8217;ll be right over on my scooter!&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  I leave it to you to assess the values embedded in these clothing labels. But it&amp;#8217;s worth noting that both brands are taking every opportunity to make an impression&amp;#8211;it&amp;#8217;s just that the impression they make is dramatically different.
&lt;/p&gt;

  You&amp;#8217;ve got to admit, Corn Lake is a pretty funny name for a lake. This lake near Kenora Ontario brings a certain iconic brand of cereal to mind. Enjoy.

   <title>Three Ways to Do Scratch N&#8217; Save Right</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/three-ways-to-do-scratch-n-save-right/"/>
   <updated>2012-11-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/three-ways-to-do-scratch-n-save-right</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This promotion from World Wildlife Fund reinterprets the &amp;#8216;Scratch N&amp;#8217; Save&amp;#8217; concept so brilliantly, I just had to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first saw what looked like your typical cheesy Scratch &amp;#8216;N&amp;#8217; Save promotion tucked into my daughter&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://owlkids.com/chirp/index.html&quot;&gt;Chirp Magazine&lt;/a&gt; I was mildly appalled at the audacity of sending sales materials with a child&amp;#8217;s educational magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I scratched, because scratching that shiny stuff off is fun&amp;#8211;right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/branding/10081/three-ways-to-do-scratch-n-save-right/attachment/screen-shot-2012-11-08-at-2-25-55-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-10082&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-10082&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2012-11-08 at 2.25.55 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Screen-shot-2012-11-08-at-2.25.55-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;418&quot; height=&quot;496&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This WWF promotion to encourage people to symbolically adopt a snowy owl, gorilla, bear, otter or leopard is smart on many levels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;It Plays On Familiar Tropes:&lt;/strong&gt; The piece subtly reminds the viewer that consumerism doesn&amp;#8217;t create the kind of warm and fuzzy feelings you get when you donate to save a species. They don&amp;#8217;t hit you over the head with the message, but by using the tropes of consumer culture they get their point across&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;It Exploits the Fact that People want to Interact: &lt;/strong&gt;Scratch N&amp;#8217; Saves are fun. Humans like to interact with things and manipulate them. In fact I&amp;#8217;m sure there&amp;#8217;s a whole psych dissertation on this subject somewhere, but I haven&amp;#8217;t read it. But we can all agree on this basic principal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  I&lt;strong&gt;t Makes Critical Connections:&lt;/strong&gt; Not only  does your symbolic adoption of an animal save the animal, but WWF takes the time to demonstrate the connection between saving animals, preserving their habitats and the wellbeing of the planet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What will you be buying your loved one this holiday season. Reward WWF and the planet by &lt;a href=&quot;https://wwfstore.donorportal.ca/c-11-wildlife-adoptions.aspx?utm_source=homepage&amp;amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;amp;utm_content=snowyowl2&amp;amp;utm_campaign=adoptions2012&quot;&gt;giving the gift of a symbolic adoption&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8211;your donation even comes with an adorable plush version of the animal, and an adoption certificate.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Came across this, felt compelled to watch it. And I&amp;#8217;m glad I did.&lt;br&gt;
You won&amp;#8217;t regret slowing down and watching it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will it fly? Does it matter? Those who believe it will enjoy how they feel for as long as they do.&lt;br&gt;
I guess people who don&amp;#8217;t dream in technicolor don&amp;#8217;t know what they&amp;#8217;re missing, but I can&amp;#8217;t help feeling sorry for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope it reminds you that whatever you&amp;#8217;re working on, the pain is a privilege too. And I hope it inspires you to keep on creating. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Rick Mercer&#8217;s Experimental Lakes Rant: Ontario Lakes Project</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/rick-mercers-experimental-lakes-rant-ontario-lakes-project/"/>
   <updated>2012-11-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/rick-mercers-experimental-lakes-rant-ontario-lakes-project</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week we&amp;#8217;re using the space normally dedicated to an Ontario Lakes logo to raise an issue that is of great importance to those of us that love Ontario lakes and are in the habit of using water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Experimental Lakes are 58 lakes that have been used for cutting edge research that has brought about important changes in regulations around water. Like the link between detergent phosphates and green algae? Researchers from the Experimental Lakes figured that one out, and the result has been a monumental shift in how detergent is manufactured in this country. And that&amp;#8217;s just one small example, but there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/regions/central/pub/ela-rle/index-eng.htm&quot;&gt;many, many more.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CBC said it best back in May&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ELA is also internationally known for research into everything from acid rain to climate change to fish farming — essentially, all the ways that human activity can affect freshwater systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to do declare the slated 2013 shutting down of Experimental Lakes a bad idea, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thepetitionsite.com/355/851/152/save-the-experimental-lakes-area/&quot;&gt;sign the petition&lt;/a&gt; and stand up for fresh water.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Anders Ramsay: Agile UX Health Check</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/agile-ux-health-check/"/>
   <updated>2012-10-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/agile-ux-health-check</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a guest post by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.andersramsay.com/&quot; title=&quot;Anders Ramsay&quot;&gt;Anders Ramsay&lt;/a&gt;, who&amp;#8217;ll be leading a &lt;a href=&quot;http://uxinto.ca/&quot;&gt;workshop&lt;/a&gt; called &amp;#8220;Designing With Agile: Fast, Effective UX Methods That Work&amp;#8221; at the Gladstone Hotel on Nov. 30th as part of our partnership with &lt;a href=&quot;http://rosenfeldmedia.com/workshops/&quot; title=&quot;Rosenfeldmedia Workshops&quot;&gt;Rosenfeldmedia&lt;/a&gt; to bring their intimate User Experience Design workshops to Toronto.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When adopting a new way of working, it&amp;#8217;s natural to use what you currently know as a starting point, and to frame questions about the new thing you are learning using the terminology and perspective of the old way of working. So, if you are a UX designer coming from a traditional UX background, which tends to have a strong process focus, it&amp;#8217;s no surprise that you may be asking questions like “What is the Agile process? And are we following it?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These questions may seem innocent enough. But it’s actually not too different from asking “Where on the bicycle does the steering wheel go?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbicyclog.wordpress.com%2F2009%2F03%2F05%2Fsteering-wheel-bicycle%2F&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;sntz=1&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHr7kIo8cmk5nYDXwHmctnV7_wkFg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Lz7EDVReu8C247WayIqAr76m4Hz3JF5CUDuQkFVxpe4JzVCxZWRyt-gnY27frRogDszMMmDSqp_iLTmkzRrRJdihEelr1mMkT3yZNgGmK3UKiBpukeMi&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;385px;&quot; height=&quot;289px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, in the case of the bike, it’s pretty obvious the question doesn’t make any sense. But it can be far less obvious to someone new to Agile that there is no such thing as a specific Agile process. The “process” in an Agile world, is a continually emergent path forged by a self-organized team, not too different from E.L. Doctorow’s famous description of novel-writing, that it’s&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“like driving at night in the fog. You can only see as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What matters is if the team is equipped to forge this path and make good progress toward their destination. What matters is if they are able to collaborate and communicate in an effective and healthy fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an Agile UX coach, when evaluating a new team or organization, I usually conduct a kind of informal Agile UX health check, in the form of a set of core questions. In some cases, I ask them outright to members of the team, in others it’s just something I’m asking myself. Among the innumerable possible questions one can ask in assessing a team’s health, I have found the questions below to be an effective barometer of how well they work together and their ability to deliver a high quality product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How early do developers become actively involved?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By developers, I am referring to anyone participating in making the actual product. By active involvement, I mean direct participation in product research, design, and implementation. Sitting in a meeting watching a presentation of work someone else did is passive participation and does not count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/PqNKQSkJBlMDwopf7spAIpL-jaTz7YdYnTbtgN2FhSkF18Di1ioF6WJhTkZ7mNk11FK1PqQi1GtVjY9xyM90q_qhXDvjdeyNQTpD4XH0_a_iD_N9dmuI&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;530px;&quot; height=&quot;353px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A developer who is actively participating in early design work can often do something most designers can not: they can tell you when starting to build the product will be more valuable than continuing to imagine and describe it. They will help you fail faster and keep your ideas closer to the proverbial rubber hitting the road. They are also often able to offer ideas for solutions that a non-developer may not have considered. Just as importantly, early active involvement helps reduce the destructive Us/Them relationship that so easily emerges between designers and developers when they work separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But like many things worth doing, this can be damn hard to pull off. Active involvement by developers early, ideally starting on project day one, requires an organizational culture that sees just as much value in developers participating in sketching and exploring the product experience as in having them code that experience, as well as that one activity deeply informs the other. It also requires that developers themselves are of a mindset that believes in this way of working. If they are, this will usually also mean that they’re going to be more attentive to experience quality in general while working on the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is basically priceless when it comes to delivering a well-designed product, because no matter how good a UX designer may be in defining a great experience, the buck will ultimately stop with the coder. They make the final atomic-level choices about how the product will work. They fiil in blanks where design documents fall short, or, for better or worse, choose to ignore them, in trying get a feature out the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successful Agile UX adoption, in other words, is not just about transforming how UX designers work, but how the whole team works, particularly developers. If they are actively involved early on, that is a clear indicator of healthy collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Do UX’ers also code or design?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While having developers participate in design work is great, collaboration in an Agile UX model is not a one-way street. It is just as important for UX designers to be crossing the design-engineering chasm in the opposite direction. The degree to which they do this is another key indicator of Agile UX team health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong id=&quot;internal-source-marker_0.9699167157523334&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/MTK3xTCD3u2umwzaIZwH4Rbe-h7bOsvxK81yJy0qBPvQdGGCChuvIxFp79AwaMGih_XWLFanZJOZg2Bl6f2S54-OqvCEc0JxKui35EEMZYW-SS5Vqkt3&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;470px;&quot; height=&quot;312px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common, and least healthy, pattern I see in this area is the UX designer who strictly does UX design and nothing else. This is like only writing recipes but never actually baking any cakes. Being a coder or a visual designer in addition to doing UX means you have a much more multi-dimensional perspective on the product. It also increases your empathy for the effort of other team members, and reduces communication churn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’m talking about production-grade coding or designing production-grade visual assets. That is not to say that there is no value in having UX designers code and design throw-away prototypes. It’s much better than nothing at all. But getting back to our cake analogy, that is like creating a plastic model of your cake. We can look at it and it may have some benefits over just reading a recipe. But we can’t eat it. We can’t truly experience it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point of doing production-grade coding isn’t just about the coding part, it’s also a social and cultural thing. When you are checking in code, when you get to see automated tests puke out all kinds of errors, when you at some point break the build (and you will break the build at some point), and pair with another developer to figure out the problem, you are collaborating on a completely different level than if you’re building throw-away models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How does the team determine if the design is good?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method by which a team decides if a design is of sufficient quality can be very revealing of their general health and effectiveness. Traditional teams tends to use approval from a client or a business sponsor to determine this. Quite honestly, this is an area where many Agile teams fare only somewhat better, with the concept of Done. Done is basically a judgment call made by the team, and ultimately by the Product Owner, as to whether the team should stop or continue work on a feature. It’s great for helping teams make decisions and move forward, but it can also lead to shipping half-baked crap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, the feature you shipped may technically support what the customer asked for, but oh boy is it ugly and a pain in the ass to use. Some developers like to talk about how what really matters is that the features do what the customer requested and that everything else is icing on the cake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To all those developers, I would like to thank them by serving them the following ready-to-eat pork-chop meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/q6m9ac-AKqDCtPuwpkIVc9wRE_q5eVtoQW7gqg9lUsNEONZonnfK_oiGPpiZv7LcIX0exoX6fnzTX8Qgl_8uSHaRM2mGH0utGravAgkh_bcY8lK3yNpb&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;458px;&quot; height=&quot;256px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically speaking, it contains all the ingredients of a pork-chop, but oh-my-gawd does it look awful. And eating it? Gaaaaaaahhhhh. (Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know this is for wartime consumption on the battlefield, but you get my point.) Compare this to a pork-chop dinner you might be served in a good restaurant, one in which presentation and all kinds of intangibles have been tended to. It looks good and is a pleasure to consume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lwVzgYUmfzX4LipI7kjwnBdJrRZbXTiA9OkRx1S0usOISufhlUPe4JTiZ34T15pLMfKt_Q8jG2PeZq1wL4GBnxwJ-kt7e6WSO5wox-ya80TKjMuv4VdD&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;216px;&quot; height=&quot;321px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, getting back to our original question, how do we determine if the design is good. Well, the only real way to know if a design is good is if actual users are f*ing using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of several areas where Lean Startup can come to the rescue. We use metrics and other forms of validation from real or prospective customers to measure whether or not a feature is good, or just as importantly, if it sucks. Too many times UX designers and clients get so wrapped up in their own &amp;#8220;succes theater&amp;#8221; (my favorite Eric Ries term), that they convince themselves of the brilliance of their own ideas, when in fact it may or may not have any basis in reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
  Does the team have a co-location mindset?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/q57-a_ZHpc64Jh8vVoAbImaOCw238OE_pgZ_v10D6wN1lym6A59pTO8Jf5WVqB-Uo2pAms0wmLzZHqxRtlftv70hrgx8H5OIIoAd5ItLlQlJu10kZPnL&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;367px;&quot; height=&quot;295px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a lot of talk in Agile circles about how everyone should be working in the same room. Well, guess what, you can put a bunch of people in the same room, but if they aren’t used to working that way, if they’ve been sitting in cubicles their entire working career, you may end up with a bunch of agitated wrecks who want nothing more than for everyone else to get out of their hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more important than being physically co-located is to have what I call a co-location mindset, which effectively is the ability to communicate as if you were face-to-face even when you’re not. A great indicator of a co-location mindset is when the team can maintain a low bullshit-to-content ratio in their virtual communication. For example, rather than needing to formulate long-winded emails intended to really only ask another team member a single question, you can just pop up a chat window and (gasp!) just ask the question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, a team scattered across the planet that communicates openly and frankly and without a lot of ceremony is more healthy in my book than a co-located team where everyone is walking on eggshells. Now, don&amp;#8217;t get me wrong, achieving good quality and fast communication is often much easier when you’re co-located. Just don’t assume it will happen automatically because everyone is in the same room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Is the whole organization participating in the Agile adoption?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A team within a larger organization is not an island. They are part of an inter-connected eco-system, and you can’t try to have just, say, the design department of an org “go Agile.” So a key question is the degree to which other parts of the organization also asre adopting Agile methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of them are parts of a company you’d likely never associate with Agile and, as such, are hidden barriers if they are not part of the overall Agile adoption. Here are some of the more common Agile bogey men that might be lurking in the dark corners of your company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with Business Development, basically the progenitors of new project work. Very often, projects will be framed around phases of work, with the research folks only participating early on, and developers scheduled to be brought in much later in the project. In other words, you’ve basically been locked into a waterfall project before you’ve even started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great example is the facilities group. Agile is very much about allowing teams to shape their own physical workspace around their own needs. However, for that to be possible, whoever is in charge of room setup, desks, meeting rooms etc. needs to understand the value of empowering teams in this way. However, what often is the case is that those individuals are far removed from the Agile adoption, and trying to get them involved can be a major bureaucratic headache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but least is the IT Dept. You’d think that they’d be your closest ally when it comes to adopting Agile, and that may often be the case, but don’t assume it. Don’t even assume that they have adopted Agile in the first place. And if they have, don’t assume that the flavor of Agile is one which will welcome UX designers into their midst. In many cases, what they are really practicing is Agile-fall, where they certainly do practice Agile methods when it comes to the coding part, but when it comes to the experience part, they still expect others to tell them and preferably specify in detail what they should build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several other parts of an org that can be a hidden barrier to an Agile adoption, such as HR or the marketing dept. The more of these that are not involved, the less healthy your adoption is likely to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How did you fare? Was this a useful health check?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this health check, few teams, especially those in a large organization will get a perfect bill of health, but it is a great goal to strive for and a helpful measuring stick in determining how well your team is doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would your team fare in answering these questions? What other question do you think should be part of an Agile UX health check? Let me know in the comments, or via &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andersramsay&quot; title=&quot;Anders Ramsay on twitter&quot;&gt;the Twitters&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-10035  &quot; title=&quot;iphone-html-email&quot; alt=&quot;iPhone email&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/iphone-html-email.jpg&quot; width=&quot;172&quot; height=&quot;257&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want people to read your emails? You should consider where they&amp;#8217;re reading it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, I don&amp;#8217;t mean the washroom, the dinner table, or the boardroom when no one is looking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather the mobile device that enables reading in these venues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://designmodo.com/responsive-design-examples/&quot; title=&quot;Responsive design examples&quot;&gt;Responsive web design&lt;/a&gt; has become an important part of our toolkit at Hypenotic, because we want our clients to reach as wide an audience as possilbe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A responsively designed website adapts to fit the device you&amp;#8217;re using to view it. The layout and even the content are tweaked depending on whether you&amp;#8217;re viewing a site on a desktop, a laptop, a tablet or mobile phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responsive Design principals are now being applied to email to make them more readable on mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to this &lt;a href=&quot;http://litmus.com/blog/email-client-market-share-stats-infographic-june-2012/email-client-market-share-june-2012&quot; title=&quot;Litmus email market share infographic&quot;&gt;infographic by Litmus&lt;/a&gt; more of your audience is using their iPhone to read your newsletter than Outlook. And by a thin, but growing, margin more are using mobile devices than either their desktop or webmail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want them to read it &amp;#8212; heck love it &amp;#8212; then you better think about how to make it a satisfying experience. That means thinking about how to provide interesting, relevant and useful content &amp;#8212; that&amp;#8217;s easy to consume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re reading this on your phone, you&amp;#8217;ll notice this email isn&amp;#8217;t exactly responsive. Call it the cobbler&amp;#8217;s shoes. We&amp;#8217;re working on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think? How long will it be before you begin optimizing your outbound communications for mobile readers?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Yes! I Will Be A Mosquito for Halloween</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/my-little-halloween-problem/"/>
   <updated>2012-10-25T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/my-little-halloween-problem</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/fun-stuff/10021/my-little-halloween-problem/attachment/screen-shot-2012-10-25-at-10-40-53-am&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-10023&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-10023&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2012-10-25 at 10.40.53 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-shot-2012-10-25-at-10.40.53-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;570&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like lots of things about Halloween. I the dressing up part, the way kids parade throughout the neighbourhood, being visited by pint-sized draculas and fairies.  I really do enjoy it. That&amp;#8217;s why I don&amp;#8217;t do any of the very well intended alternatives to Halloween like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uusc.org/rtot/reverse-trick-or-treating&quot;&gt;reverse trick or treating &lt;/a&gt; or staying home and throwing a party and giving the kids as much cake as they can consume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Halloween gives me grief because it presses so many pain points that are core to my values system. Please, let me unload:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  I don&amp;#8217;t like my kids eating tons of candy and begging for it constantly. That food is unhealthy and I don&amp;#8217;t want it in the house.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  I don&amp;#8217;t like supporting big, bad companies like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nestle.ca/en/index&quot;&gt;Nestlé&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.canadaonly.ca/brands/Cadbury.html&quot;&gt;Cadbury&lt;/a&gt; who make a living off of making bad food (even if they sometimes run &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9305/why-cadburys-bicycle-factory-is-a-few-spokes-shy-of-a-wheel&quot;&gt;CSR programs to &amp;#8220;give back&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  I am fundamentally opposed to the horrible practices that basically mean that some far-away children suffer to harvest cacao so that our kids can have fun, eat crap and get fat (Have you read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/valentines/qa-off.html&quot;&gt;Carole Off&amp;#8217;s Bitter Chocolate?&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so granted I was not in a good frame-of-mind when I ran into Loblaws (not my usual store but conveniently located for the rush to pick up the kids). I went to find some better Halloween options. You know where this is going&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, call me naive, but I figured with all of their hoopla about local and sustainable (aside from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestar.com/living/article/1127787--loblaw-chief-says-farmers-markets-pose-health-risk&quot;&gt;Galen&amp;#8217;s gaff about Farmer&amp;#8217;s Markets&lt;/a&gt;) over at Loblaws there had to be &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; decent to pick off the shelves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the day I visited, the Loblaws&amp;#8217; staff were outfitted in t-shirts about saving the ocean (I figure it&amp;#8217;s part of their  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oceansfortomorrow.ca/en/leading-change/&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;Oceans for Tomorrow&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; campaign to have only sustainable seafood in the store by 2013). That made it even more ironic when I discovered nothing but the usual Halloween fare on the store shelves. None of the staff could help me and in fact seemed to think the question about &amp;#8220;alternative halloween options&amp;#8221; made me such a fringe freako that they were wondering why they didn&amp;#8217;t smell the Patchouli when I walked through the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now, in addition to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the bad feelings I have swarming my head about Halloween I also have to deal with my distaste for CSR hypocrisy where a company can be working to save the oceans while still making money primarily on the sale of horrible processed food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just in case you thought it was a matter of supply, there are a few options like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yummyearth.com/index.html&quot;&gt;organic lollypops&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Annies-Homegrown-Halloween-Graham-9-7-Ounce/dp/B008POG4X0&quot;&gt;bunny crackers&lt;/a&gt;, etc. In fact there&amp;#8217;s a whole list at &lt;a href=&quot;http://greenhalloween.org/content.php?page=treats&quot;&gt;Green Halloween&lt;/a&gt;, But you&amp;#8217;ve got to be on the  ball enough to order ahead of time or track that stuff down. And while I&amp;#8217;m totally game to live by my values, I&amp;#8217;m still a mom with little time on her hands, looking for something I can get quickly and close to home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my solution for the past three years has been buying &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lasiembra.com/camino/en/chocolate-treats&quot;&gt;Cocoa Camino Chocolate Treats&lt;/a&gt; and giving one to each child. My kids think I&amp;#8217;m a horrible person for giving such a tiny morsel out on Halloween, but those chocolates are expensive. I&amp;#8217;m not complaining. I realize I&amp;#8217;m paying the &amp;#8220;full cost&amp;#8221; of producing chocolate. But that means each kid gets one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that giving away just one is a good thing, since I wish my kids came home with a few, well curated treats rather than a bag overflowing with crap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, of course I remain conflicted. Even though I will post these &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.equalexchange.coop/fairtradehalloween&quot;&gt;fair trade Halloween posters &lt;/a&gt;to help make sense of the tiny chocolate morsel kids will get in their bag, it is unlikely that it will make much of an impact in and amongst the mountains of Kit Kat and Coffee Crisps that will be dumped on the floor and sorted out late Halloween night. I&amp;#8217;m also inserting a small card inside the bag. It will read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  Happy Halloween!
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  You might notice we put a (tiny) fair trade chocolate in your child&amp;#8217;s bag. There&amp;#8217;s a reason for this and you can find out more about the reason here  &lt;a href=&quot;http://foodispower.org/slavery_chocolate.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://foodispower.org/&lt;wbr&gt;slavery_chocolate.php&lt;/wbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  We hope next year you consider joining us in making food fair, for everyone.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sure they&amp;#8217;ll be alot of eye rolling in the neighbourhood Halloween night. Oh well. This is one issue I&amp;#8217;m going to take a small stand on. While I generally avoid frequently used quotes, I am reminded of this one attributed to the Dali Lama: &amp;#8220;If you think you are too small to make a difference, try sleeping with a mosquito.&amp;#8221; Hey, I think I just figured out my Halloween costume (no, not the Dali Lama, a mosquito silly.)&lt;/p&gt;

Below you&amp;#8217;ll find part of an article from the Stevens Point Herald, dated 1882 announcing the killing of an infamous serpent lurking in the waters of Lac Des Chats (sourced directly from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cryptomundo.com/cryptozoo-news/chats-kill/&quot;&gt;Cryptomundo&lt;/a&gt;)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But this week we are in a position to announce the capture of what is probably one of the progeny of the original old Chats Lake serpent, which has often struck terror to the hearts of the superstitious river men&amp;#8230;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
  They succeeded in getting within striking distance of the serpent when Mr. Durgan struck it a blow over the head with his oar. The beast then turned and made for the occupants of the boat, literally churning the water with his tail in his fury. Another powerful and well-directed blow with an oar on the neck of the serpent laid it out dead when it was taken in tow and brought aboard the steamer.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
  The crew of the boat stretched it out on the rail and measured it with a rule. Its total length was eleven feet, while the body was thirteen inches in circumference. Its jaws were pried open and a pair of compasses inserted, which were opened out to a distance of six inches.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
    Now that&amp;#8217;s a big snake. Wonder if any other progeny are still lurking in Lac Des Chats. Who&amp;#8217;s game to find out?

   <title>Soda, Content Strategy and Bears. Oh my.</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/9972/"/>
   <updated>2012-10-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/9972</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I heard Alex Bogusky of famed ad agency Crispin, Porter and Bogusky was &lt;a href=&quot;http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/01/bogusky-creative-ad-star-is-leaving-advertising/&quot; title=&quot;Alex Bogusky leaving the field, NY Times&quot;&gt;leaving the agency&lt;/a&gt; to find work more in tune with his values, I kind of shrugged. I know a lot of people who made (and make) their fortune in ways that didn&amp;#8217;t take impact into account. It&amp;#8217;s an ongoing effort not to be judgemental about why many smart folks aren&amp;#8217;t guided by their conscience until they&amp;#8217;re good and comfy. It&amp;#8217;s a flaw (because it turns out I&amp;#8217;m not perfect). I&amp;#8217;m working on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I took notice of his latest effort for a few reasons, and I think you should too. It&amp;#8217;s a video that shares a few facts about the potential effects of consuming sugary sodas regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; It&amp;#8217;s a pretty entertaining piece–the animation, music and messages are all swell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; I fear it&amp;#8217;s getting attention because Alex is a celebrity seemingly attacking a former client, which means this is buzz, not viral, and won&amp;#8217;t ultimately affect perceptions. Of course I hope the fear is unfounded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; It&amp;#8217;s polarizing (polarbearingizing?). The very first comment on the Mashable post expresses the common right wing concern that we shouldn&amp;#8217;t be attacking corporations. Rather, parents should educate their children so they might make better decisions. A measured responder helps the first commenter understand the research and psychology dollars and tactics parents are contending against.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sincerely hope Alex is working it out and will eventually bring his full genius to &amp;#8216;bear&amp;#8217; helping the public see through the &amp;#8216;be happy&amp;#8217; screen (that he was once such a force in weaving) to more conscious consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The campaign is housed on a standalone site that helps you focus on 3 actions: Watch, Share, Learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9972/9972/attachment/screen-shot-2012-10-13-at-october-13-11-45am&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9983&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-9983&quot; title=&quot;therealbears.org page screengrab&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-shot-2012-10-13-at-October-13-11.45AM-580x405.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;405&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a great focused approach. Some things I might consider to make the campaign more social include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Turn the (fascinating) litany of facts (truths) into an infographic. A glance at beautiful information might hook people not quite game to engage in a 3+ minute video. These folks might arguably be an important audience as they&amp;#8217;re outside the community of core advocates who already support the cause. And images are pretty easy to share and post on our networks and profiles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Make each of the truths shareable via social networks and email. This can be done by adding subtle social sharing icons, or &amp;#8220;share&amp;#8221; icon that lists the sharing options on rollover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Write a blog post about each of the facts (that&amp;#8217;s commentable and shareable). These can be as rich as you like, including digging into the fact in question, interviewing people who should have thoughts on it, including experts and parents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Offer a newsletter signup that gets ongoing campaign information and ideas for engaging others, highlights the efforts of campaign heros (parents and teachers, etc) in my inbox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess what I&amp;#8217;m after, ultimately, is for this to be the beginning of an important conversation, and leery of letting it become the conversation itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>5 Ways San Francisco Gets It Right</title>

   <updated>2012-10-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/4-reasons-san-francisco-does-city-building-right</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/fun-stuff/9974/4-reasons-san-francisco-does-city-building-right/attachment/screen-shot-2012-10-12-at-10-37-34-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9977&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9977&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2012-10-12 at 10.37.34 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-shot-2012-10-12-at-10.37.34-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;394&quot; height=&quot;388&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barry and I spent last week in San Francisco. We left with a deep sense that this is a city that has its priorities straight.  This is a city that values community, people and culture, and preserves it at all costs. Here are 5 experiences we had that really demonstrated that San Francisco is a model city that wears its values on its sleeve:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The Wiggle&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wiggle&quot;&gt;The Wiggle&lt;/a&gt; is a mile-long bike route that guides cyclists through the city in a way that allows them to avoid extreme hills. European settlers used it as a footpath, in the late 1700s it became a horseback trail. Today it&amp;#8217;s a testament to San Francisco&amp;#8217;s bike culture. It&amp;#8217;s also an iconic symbol of what can happen when community groups work together to incorporate cycling into urban planning. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfbike.org/?wiggle&quot;&gt;recent planning&lt;/a&gt; efforts to enhance The Wiggle by increasing cyclists&amp;#8217; visibility, improving local retail presence along the route and having seating available for between streets espressos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Hardly Strictly Bluegrass (HSB): &lt;/strong&gt;We were lucky enough to be in town for this &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardly_Strictly_Bluegrass&quot;&gt;annual free and non-commercial bluegrass festival&lt;/a&gt; that occupies Golden Gate Park for an entire weekend. 800,000 people visit five stages of kick ass music and all they have to do is wander into the park&amp;#8211;no tickets, to turnstiles, no one looking in their bag. The whole musical extravaganza is funded by an endowment left by venture capitalist &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Hellman&quot;&gt;Warren Hellman&lt;/a&gt; who underwrote the entire festival from its inception to ensure that it remain entirely &amp;#8220;non-commercial.&amp;#8221; In other words, no sponsors, no beer tents, no big ugly signage. For me the most amazing thing about HSB was how it transformed my thoughts on communities of interest. Old people, middle class people, parents with toddlers and crazy, smelly, shirtless university kids all gathered together around good music and partying. Wow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;MAPP: &lt;/strong&gt;MAPP stands for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfmapp.com/&quot;&gt;Mission Arts Performance Project&lt;/a&gt; and we literally stumbled upon it walking in the Mission District one night. We turned a corner, heard music and were lured into The Mission&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-secret-garden-san-francisco&quot;&gt;Secret Garden&lt;/a&gt;, a hidden urban farm down a narrow alley way. The show was ending but we quickly realized that the guests were all headed in the same direction. We followed along (naturally) and ended up in a poet&amp;#8217;s loft where we heard awesome latin inspired musicians and listened to poetry.  MAPP is (in their words) &amp;#8220;a collage of 10-20 odd spaces transformed into micro art centres&amp;#8221; throughout the Mission District.  It is an incredible example of what happens when people, art and community are mixed together. And what happens when  you let &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/about-us&quot;&gt;Barry Martin&lt;/a&gt; lead you down a street you&amp;#8217;ve never been down before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Protected Local Neighbourhoods&lt;/strong&gt;: In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ilsr.org/san-francisco-dealing-chains/&quot;&gt;2006 San Francisco passed a law stating&lt;/a&gt; that no chain store or restaurant could open in a neighbourhood without first going through a pubic hearing and special approval from the planning commission. That means you&amp;#8217;ll see more local grocery stores, book stores and restaurants than you&amp;#8217;re likely to see anywhere in  North America. That said all of that is under threat because the city&amp;#8217;s downtown doesn&amp;#8217;t count as a neighbourhood. While we were in SF the first Target store opened Downtown and there are more to follow. This is not a good sign. But for now, it&amp;#8217;s a sight to behold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Bi-Rite Market: &lt;/strong&gt;Not only is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biritemarket.com/&quot;&gt;Bi Rite&lt;/a&gt; the most divine grocery store I&amp;#8217;ve ever been in, it is a part of a&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biritemarket.com/who-we-are/the-bi-rite-family-of-businesses/&quot;&gt; family of businesses&lt;/a&gt; that together express a clear and delicious values-proposition. In addition to the grocery store, there&amp;#8217;s a creamery, a catering company, fruit and vegetable farms, and the piece de resisance, a non-profit community education centre called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.18reasons.org/&quot;&gt;18 Reasons&lt;/a&gt; which is (in their words) &amp;#8220;a space to further connect neighbors with producers of food and wine.&amp;#8221; There are community dinners, wine tastings and cheese tastings. It&amp;#8217;s what helped inspire Toronto&amp;#8217;s own &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedepanneur.ca/&quot;&gt;The Depanneur&lt;/a&gt; (owned by Hypenotic alum Len Senater). If you were in San Francisco today, you&amp;#8217;d have the opportunity to go to 18 Reasons and learn how GMO&amp;#8217;s affect health, crop diversity, and the environment and tomorrow you could make apple strudel (GMO free of course). Here&amp;#8217;s to a business growing right, not just growing big.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you been to SF? What did we miss? I need to know for my next visit.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Clearwater Lake&#8217;s Outdoor Adventure</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/clearwater-lakes-outdoor-adventure/"/>
   <updated>2012-10-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/clearwater-lakes-outdoor-adventure</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-9939&quot; title=&quot;Clearwater Lake v2&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ClearwaterLake1-580x457.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;464&quot; height=&quot;366&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  What would you say if I told you that you could go &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portage&quot;&gt;portaging&lt;/a&gt; with your motor boat? You would probably think I&amp;#8217;m crazy. After all, who wants to pick up a heavy motor boat and carry it around? Well, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.clearwaterlodge.net/&quot;&gt;Clearwater Lodge&lt;/a&gt; at Clearwater Lake, their mechanical &amp;#8220;roller coaster&amp;#8221; system allows you to gain access to the entire lake system in one easy trip:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s the mechanical portages that make this lake system what it is, giving the unparalleled access to the entire lake chain. It&amp;#8217;s definitely what makes this lake system unique. As far as we know there is no other lake system that provides this type of mechanical portaging any where else in Ontario.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system was put into place so you can choose wherever you would like to go and fish to your heart&amp;#8217;s content. To the south you&amp;#8217;ll find Walleye, Muskie, Pike and Bass. To the north you&amp;#8217;ve got your Trout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;#8217;ve always wanted to portage sans canoe, then Clearwater Lodge&amp;#8217;s Roller Coaster Mechanical Portage is for you!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How McDonald&#8217;s Created a Campaign Around Not Answering Your Questions</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/9908/"/>
   <updated>2012-09-28T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/9908</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9908/9908/attachment/screen-shot-2012-09-28-at-4-48-08-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9922&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9922&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2012-09-28 at 4.48.08 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screen-shot-2012-09-28-at-4.48.08-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;447&quot; height=&quot;179&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McDonald&amp;#8217;s has scaled up the &amp;#8220;lets pull back the curtain&amp;#8221; faux-transparency approach they piloted with Canadian mommy bloggers about a year ago (I &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/7402/the-triple-threat-of-mcdonalds-cityline-and-mommy-bloggers&quot;&gt;blogged about that initiative here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now McDonald&amp;#8217;s has a whole campaign around answering your questions in an open, honest way. They claim &amp;#8220;we&amp;#8217;ll answer any questions about our food.&amp;#8221; In some ways this campaign is very encouraging. It shows that McDonald&amp;#8217;s is feeling some pressure about their business practices and about the quality of their food. So, food activists who have worked hard to shine a light on everything from pink slime to non-disintegrating Big Macs can pat themselves on the back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it&amp;#8217;s interesting to see what passes for &amp;#8220;answering questions.&amp;#8221; What I see when I review the questions and answers on &lt;a href=&quot;http://yourquestions.mcdonalds.ca/&quot;&gt;McDonald&amp;#8217;s dedicated question/answer website&lt;/a&gt; are a lot of clever (or not so clever) rhetorical devices standing in for answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s what I mean by way of one example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9908/9908/attachment/screen-shot-2012-09-27-at-4-07-52-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9909&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-9909&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2012-09-27 at 4.07.52 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screen-shot-2012-09-27-at-4.07.52-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;621&quot; height=&quot;135&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  Not to nit-pick, but is this an answer to the simple question about whether (or not) the food is healthy? It appears not.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  Let&amp;#8217;s take a moment to pull this apart, shall we?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The opener: &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;re proud of our food.&amp;#8221; Um, don&amp;#8217;t remember asking. Seriously, who asked ya? According to McD&amp;#8217;s site, they won&amp;#8217;t answer questions from the public if they deem them to contain &amp;#8220;subjective comments or statements.&amp;#8221; So, is your personal expression of pride not a subjective statement? And anyway, what does it have to do with anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  We &amp;#8220;believe it can be part of a balanced diet.&amp;#8221; Now that&amp;#8217;s some tricky jargon. And you believe? That seems subjective to me. &amp;#8220;Part of a healthy diet&amp;#8221; which part is that? Years ago Nestlé was a client of mine (obviously different agency) and they used precisely this kind of jargon when the obesity epidemic hit :&amp;#8221;All foods can be part of a healthy diet eaten in moderation.&amp;#8221; It&amp;#8217;s just a cover-up that keeps them from admitting that no, their food is not healthy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &amp;#8220;We offer a variety of nutrition minded options&amp;#8230;.&amp;#8221; This is a classic misdirection. It&amp;#8217;s like a shell game. Don&amp;#8217;t want someone to see that you have an object in your right hand, wave your left hand all over the place. Sure you serve apples (with caramel sauce), but that doesn&amp;#8217;t erase the fact that much of the other crap you serve is decidedly not healthy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &amp;#8220;We encourage you to look at our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcdonalds.ca/ca/en/food/making_informed_choices.html&quot;&gt;Making Informed Choices Page.&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; Yes, there&amp;#8217;s information on the page. Lots of it. Information about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcdonalds.ca/ca/en/food/making_informed_choices/canadas_food_guide.html&quot;&gt;how to eat healthier &lt;/a&gt;, about McD&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcdonalds.ca/ca/en/food/nutrition_calculator.html&quot;&gt;nutrition calculator&lt;/a&gt; that tell you how many calories, fat, etc. are in the food you&amp;#8217;ll find at McDonalds. So, now I know that an Angus burger with bacon has 780 calories and 44 grams of fat. But providing information doesn&amp;#8217;t make your food healthy. Now, if you could please just answer the question.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disheartening part of all of this is that McDonald&amp;#8217;s has spent so much time, money and energy on not answering your questions. Why bother? Because the pressure&amp;#8217;s on. That&amp;#8217;s the good news in all of this. Some marketing executive somewhere feels that the public needs to hear McD&amp;#8217;s answer to its critics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I for one find this expression of faux transparency refreshingly revealing.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Forget Playing it Safe</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/forget-playing-it-safe/"/>
   <updated>2012-09-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/forget-playing-it-safe</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9900&quot; title=&quot;damngoodadvice&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/damngoodadvice2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;382&quot; height=&quot;201&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently read &lt;a href=&quot;http://metronews.ca/voices/the-in-credibility-factor/381917/hiretheworld-com-creator-says-forget-playing-it-safe/&quot;&gt;an interview&lt;/a&gt; highlighting &lt;a href=&quot;http://terrybeech.com/&quot;&gt;Terry Beech&lt;/a&gt;, Co-Founder and CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hiretheworld.com/&quot;&gt;HiretheWorld.com&lt;/a&gt;. HiretheWorld  is essentially a freelance designer market where hundreds of designers compete for projects. There are a lot of discussions for and against this particular business model, but that&amp;#8217;s for another post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was the striking about the interview were the similarities between Beech&amp;#8217;s Action Plan, my own, and that of Hypenotic&amp;#8217;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;1. &amp;#8220;Have an intense focus on value creation&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You should always focus on what you can do to improve a person&amp;#8217;s life rather than think about the fastest way to make a dollar. When you provide value and care to your customers, the money will always follow. Something that our clients love is that we, at Hypenotic are determined to help our clients to truly understand the thought process behind their projects. In the end, they get the very best solution—even if that means having to change the original request.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;
  One could argue that &amp;#8220;the customer is always right&amp;#8221;, and yes one needs to keep an open mind. However, it is a designer&amp;#8217;s obligation to provide their clients with the tools and knowledge necessary to get the most out of their projects. If that means suggesting an alternative solution, you shouldn&amp;#8217;t be afraid to speak your mind in a professional and respectful manner. Your clients will most definitely respect you in return. Ours do.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;2. &amp;#8220;Surround yourself with amazing people who love what they do&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is something I&amp;#8217;ve found really makes a difference in your career and life as a whole. Surrounding yourself with like-minded, focused, and driven people will ensure that you are always pushing your boundaries and striving to improve yourself in everything you do. If you want to be more creative, surrounding yourself with creative individuals will in almost all situations inspire you to be the same.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;
  As a company, Hypenotic surrounds itself with passionate clients who all have a positive message or focus on improving the community as a whole. As a result, we as a team become just as passionate about the work we do since we know it is making a direct impact on the world we live in.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;3. &amp;#8220;Do not fear what others think of you because it will keep you from taking risks&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;You may regret the risks that go badly, but you will most definitely always regret not taking the risks you wanted to take because you were playing it safe. In the words of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_School_Bus&quot;&gt;Ms. Frizzle&lt;/a&gt; (yes, I definitely just aged myself there) &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Take chances, make mistakes, and get messy&amp;#8221; &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;
  Obviously you should trust your instincts on taking what to you are intelligent risks in life. Always keep in mind that taking a risk also means growing as an individual, and as such allowing positive change into your all aspects of your life—including your career.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just in case you&amp;#8217;d like to improve upon your already awesome self, here&amp;#8217;s an excerpt from the 2011 SFU Alumni Association&amp;#8217;s Annual Gathering, where Beech goes into greater detail on the steps that you can take to be even more awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-9913&quot; title=&quot;LakeChemong&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/LakeChemong_v3-580x391.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;522&quot; height=&quot;352&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Lake Chemong near Peterborough is very a popular destination for cottagers, partly because of the spectacular views. For example, check out  a photograph of the view from one cottage on Lake Chemong listed on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cottagesincanada.com/canadianlakefrontcottage&quot;&gt;CottagesinCanada.com&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/ontario-lakes-project/9890/voyeur-enjoys-the-view-at-lake-chemong-ontario-lakes-project/attachment/screen-shot-2012-09-25-at-12-46-09-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9893&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9893&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2012-09-25 at 12.46.09 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screen-shot-2012-09-25-at-12.46.09-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;294&quot; height=&quot;217&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
    However, I should warn you that if you&amp;#8217;re looking to rent a cottage in on the lake, be sure to be on the lookout for a voyeur who may indeed be watching you and not the sunset.
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
    This summer a Toronto man who owns a cottage on Lake Chemong &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cp24.com/toronto-man-charged-with-voyeurism-for-allegedly-recording-cottage-renters-1.854808&quot;&gt;was charged with voyeurism&lt;/a&gt; when a renter contacted OPP after discovering security cameras inside and outside the cottage, including in the master bedroom.
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
    The moral of the story. Enjoy the view at Lake Chemong. Just be sure you&amp;#8217;re not it.
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Formula to Deliver Information with Impact</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/the-best-brochure-youll-ever-see/"/>
   <updated>2012-09-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/the-best-brochure-youll-ever-see</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9868/the-best-brochure-youll-ever-see/attachment/screen-shot-2012-09-20-at-5-08-58-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9880&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-9880&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2012-09-20 at 5.08.58 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screen-shot-2012-09-20-at-5.08.58-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;492&quot; height=&quot;260&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2010, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.changemakers.com/&quot;&gt;Ashoka&lt;/a&gt; came out with a brochure all about their impact as an organization. I just found it on my desk. Turns out it&amp;#8217;s one of the best pieces of printed material I&amp;#8217;ve seen for a long, long time. It&amp;#8217;s not because the photographs are beautiful (in fact there are only a few tiny photos in the brochure) and its not because it&amp;#8217;s big and glossy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brochure is awesome because it clearly and convincingly articulates the impact Ashoka Fellows have in changing the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s why you should pay attention:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#8217;s Clear: &lt;/strong&gt;In the President&amp;#8217;s letter which creates the context for the brochure, she describes Ashoka Fellows&amp;#8217; initiatives in a way I hear few non-profits speak. She speaks clearly in jargon-free language that simply makes sense. Notice colloquial expressions like &amp;#8220;knock out test&amp;#8221; and concrete examples that make it absolutely clear what Ashoka stands for (and what they don&amp;#8217;t).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The knock-out test for electing Ashoka Fellows and for starting new Ashoka initiatives is the same: there needs to be a system change idea in the hands of an entrepreneur. Rather than looking to someone who is building one school or one hospital, Ashoka looks for individuals who are changing the way children learn or the way healthcare is delivered.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 13px;&quot;&gt;It&amp;#8217;s Concrete: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 13px;&quot;&gt;Every non profit wants to discuss impact. Many have a lot of anecdotal ways of measuring and reflecting their impact (like heartfelt testimonials), but Ashoka took the time to undertake a survey and shared the data that proves the effect they&amp;#8217;re having in the world. The survey defined five ways their Fellows make an impact and dug deeper to provide insights that help the data take shape. Below you see an example of the high level data, and one example of how they probe their impact in one of the five issue areas (Public Policy &amp;amp; Industry Norms)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 13px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9868/the-best-brochure-youll-ever-see/attachment/screen-shot-2012-09-20-at-4-34-10-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9869&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9869&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2012-09-20 at 4.34.10 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screen-shot-2012-09-20-at-4.34.10-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;377&quot; height=&quot;467&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9868/the-best-brochure-youll-ever-see/attachment/screen-shot-2012-09-20-at-5-03-03-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9875&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9875&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2012-09-20 at 5.03.03 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screen-shot-2012-09-20-at-5.03.03-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;436&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#8217;s Human: &lt;/strong&gt;Often research reports like this are data heavy, lacking the &amp;#8220;touchy-feely&amp;#8221; qualities that bring people closer to the issues. But this brochure does a wonderful job balancing information with emotion. For example, under the system change they call &amp;#8220;Full Citizenship &amp;amp; Empathic Ethics&amp;#8221; they feature a graph outlining how they measure this particular area. Importantly though, they also include the first person account of one Fellow named &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ashoka.org/node/3384&quot;&gt;Raquel Barros&lt;/a&gt; who has helped transform the lives of abused women in Brazil through her work with an organization called Lua Nova here&amp;#8217;s an example of her account:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew that in order to open real opportunities for them [the women] to fully re-integrate into mainstream society, Lua Nova need to work with other organizations&amp;#8230;.If I wanted their silent voices to be heard, if I wanted to attract society&amp;#8217;s attention, Lua Nova couldn&amp;#8217;t be alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#8217;s Visual:&lt;/strong&gt; Ashoka doesn&amp;#8217;t just visualize data, they visualize how Ashoka Fellows are creating fundamental &amp;#8220;system change ideas,&amp;#8221; bringing it full-circle back to the President&amp;#8217;s opening statement about what Ashoka is all about. In the case of Ashoka Fellow Raquel Barros&amp;#8217; impact, they created a simple infographic that brings the change she created to life in a way that is easy to understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9868/the-best-brochure-youll-ever-see/attachment/screen-shot-2012-09-20-at-4-55-58-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9871&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9871&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2012-09-20 at 4.55.58 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screen-shot-2012-09-20-at-4.55.58-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;283&quot; height=&quot;445&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brochure provides a great formula for non profits to share their impact and make it relevant; be clear, concrete, human and visual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out that the Ashoka Foundation is just as good at expressing change as Ashoka Fellows are at making it happen on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kudos!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Will Peregrine Falcons Fly in Charleston Lake? Ontario Lakes Project</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/9863/"/>
   <updated>2012-09-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/9863</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9884&quot; title=&quot;Charleston Lake&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/CharlestonLake_v2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;289&quot; height=&quot;422&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1920&amp;#8242;s Peregrine Falcons were a common site on rocky cliffs surrounding Charleston, just Lake North of Gananoque. But, beginning in the 1950&amp;#8242;s the falcon&amp;#8217;s exposure to DDT led the majestic birds&amp;#8217; eggs to weaken, with fewer and fewer surviving to hatching. The Peregrine Falcon was, and still is, considered a Species at Risk in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, between 2001 and 2005 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/&quot;&gt;The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lgstewardship.ca/&quot;&gt;the Leeds Stewardship Council,&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.peregrine-foundation.ca/&quot;&gt;Canadian Peregrine Foundation&lt;/a&gt; collaborated to bring Peregrine Falcons back to Charleston Lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The falcons were kept in a &amp;#8220;hack box&amp;#8221; on a cliff top beside Charleston Lake and were released after 40-45 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;50 local volunteers were trained to rescue the falcons if their maiden flights turned out to be less than successful. The volunteers watched over the birds from dusk until dawn, from boats and on land, for two weeks after each release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the success of the falcon reintroduction program at Charleston Lake is still not known. In fact, as recently as this spring &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pc.gc.ca/&quot;&gt;Parks Canada&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/&quot;&gt;Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources&lt;/a&gt; were asking community members to report any Peregrine Falcon sightings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the positive side, as recently as September 9th at 9:45 am, a member of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ebird.org/content/canada/about&quot;&gt;eBird Canada&lt;/a&gt; community, a portal which serves as  &amp;#8220;a real-time, online checklist program&amp;#8221; to track the presence of birds throughout Canada,&amp;#8221; reported a single &lt;a href=&quot;http://ebird.ca/sightings.jsp?country=CA&amp;amp;back=28&quot;&gt;Peregrine Falcon sighting near Charleston Lake.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why Thrifting is &#8220;Fucking Awesome.&#8221;</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/9845/"/>
   <updated>2012-09-14T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/9845</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m an avid and passionate thrift shopper. I&amp;#8217;ve &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/1832/bottling-the-thrill-of-thrifting&quot;&gt;written about it on this blog before&lt;/a&gt; asking the question: &amp;#8220;what is the magical mix of elements that makes thrifting such an exciting pastime?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not an easy question to answer. And it differs depending who you ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.valuevillage.com/&quot;&gt;Value Village&lt;/a&gt; is working hard to splash its version of an answer all over town. They&amp;#8217;re spending bucket-loads on print, TV and radio spots. But they haven&amp;#8217;t figured it out. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goodwill.on.ca/&quot;&gt;Goodwill&lt;/a&gt; is desperately trying to keep up by playing the &amp;#8220;cool&amp;#8221; card when it comes to re-using clothes, furniture, etc. They don&amp;#8217;t have it nailed-down either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is they&amp;#8217;re trying to talk to everyone at once&amp;#8211;moms saving a buck on their kids&amp;#8217; back to school clothes, grannies on a pension and the fashion-forward set. You can&amp;#8217;t do that. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know who&amp;#8217;s got it figured out?  &lt;a href=&quot;http://macklemore.com/&quot;&gt;Macklemore and Ryan Lewis&lt;/a&gt; do.  This mind-blowingly good music video is ostensibly a thrift anthem for those who &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; their funky thrift styles. And its aptly named Thrift Shop (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dvdlyrics.com/lyrics-m-macklemore-thrift_shop.html&quot;&gt;all the lyrics are here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because this video makes me want to run, not walk to my local thrift store, I think it&amp;#8217;s worth highlighting why these guys &lt;em&gt;get &lt;/em&gt;what is so irresistible about thrifting. And yes, I know it&amp;#8217;s really not cool to quote rap like you&amp;#8217;re writing a PhD thesis. For that I apologize in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, it&amp;#8217;s not that VV and Goodwill don&amp;#8217;t have some of the same insights behind this video. Yes, in a creative brief written by an agency somewhere, VV knows that thrift appeals to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The price conscious&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The eco conscious&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The fashion conscious&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact on the Value Village (well, Savers, the US conglomerate that owns VV) website they say &amp;#8220;we&amp;#8217;re a place where people from all backgrounds love to shop for great selection, deals and treasures.&amp;#8221; They say it, but they don&amp;#8217;t say it &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; if they want to talk to a critical part of their audience&amp;#8212;folks who wear their thrift clothes like a badge of honor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Macklemore&amp;#8217;s song is how you talk to people who rock their thrift with pride. Here&amp;#8217;s how he does it. He says;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll find &amp;#8220;fucking awesome&amp;#8221; stuff: &lt;/strong&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not &amp;#8216;cool&amp;#8217; or &amp;#8216;great&amp;#8217; stuff or &amp;#8220;fun finds.&amp;#8221; It&amp;#8217;s &lt;strong&gt;fucking awesome&lt;/strong&gt; stuff&amp;#8211;ok? Macklemore says: &amp;#8220;&amp;#8217;bout to go and get some compliments passin off in those mocassins, someone else has been walkin in&amp;#8221; Those used moccasins you found? They&amp;#8217;re fucking awesome! Grandpa&amp;#8217;s suit. It&amp;#8217;s fucking awesome! I think that&amp;#8217;s pretty clear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a bargain (bitch): &lt;/strong&gt;He says &amp;#8220;Savin my money and I&amp;#8217;m hella happy that&amp;#8217;s a bargain bitch ima take it grandpa style.&amp;#8221; It&amp;#8217;s not just that it&amp;#8217;s more affordable, it&amp;#8217;s that you can save money and own that grandpa style. Walking out of a store with a bag of (fucking) awesomeness when you had &amp;#8220;$20 in my pocket&amp;#8221; is where the magic lives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;You&amp;#8217;re Not a Sucka: &lt;/strong&gt;Macklemore spends time taking down the stupidity of spending money to line the pockets of big business. Macklemore is doing for fashion what the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thetruth.com/&quot;&gt;Truth Campaign&lt;/a&gt; did for tobacco; making you feel like a&lt;em&gt; fool&lt;/em&gt; for handing your money to big business. VV can&amp;#8217;t take this tact &amp;#8217;cause they&amp;#8217;re for a for- profit big business (and owned by Walmart). But &lt;em&gt;man&lt;/em&gt; this would be a good strategy for Goodwill if they&amp;#8217;d be willing to take a risk (they wouldn&amp;#8217;t because of corporate sponsors). I smell an opportunity! Who wants it? Macklemore says:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;They be like oh! That Gucci, that’s hella tight.I’m like Yo! That’s 50 dollars for a t-shirt. Limited edition, let’s do some simple addition, 50 dollars for a t-shirt, that’s just some ignorant bitch. I call that getting swindled and perished. I call that getting strict by a business.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, I stumbled&lt;a href=&quot;http://smashingplanets.deviantart.com/art/Billboard-Value-Village-144497431&quot;&gt; upon this ad designed by a student&lt;/a&gt; who was trying to come up with the right kind of messaging for Value Village. They get so much closer that any of those other playas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;

   <title>Regatta Shenanigans at Chandos Lake: Ontario Lakes Project</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/9831/"/>
   <updated>2012-09-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/9831</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9843&quot; title=&quot;Chandos Lake&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Chados-Lake_v2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chandos Lake&quot; width=&quot;565&quot; height=&quot;329&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many cottage associations host annual regattas. But Chandos Lake&amp;#8217;s Regatta (in the North Kawartha area) is &lt;em&gt;so so so&lt;/em&gt; good &lt;a href=&quot;http://cottagelife.com/49978/entertaining/tips-entertaining/how-to-start-a-regatta-on-your-lake&quot;&gt;Cottage Life&lt;/a&gt; highlighted theirs as &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; example of how to do it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cottage Life quotes the chair of the Chandos Lake Regatta Committee saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see the kids&amp;#8217; faces when they put on their medals–they&amp;#8217;re so excited&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say, watching the video above, most of the &amp;#8216;kids&amp;#8217; I see are hottie 20-somethings bouncing around in potato sack races, but hey, it&amp;#8217;s all good clean fun happening in Chandos Lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with Chandos Lake&amp;#8217;s Regatta as the shining example, here are their tips (abbreviated from Cottage Life) to making a Regatta truly rock:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Get the basics:&lt;/strong&gt; You&amp;#8217;ll need water with access to parking and bathrooms, and a summer weekend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Get Silly.&lt;/strong&gt; Canoe races with pie plates are much more fun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Feed People: &lt;/strong&gt;Get some burgers n&amp;#8217; dogs donated, and get a liquor permit to keep the crowds imbibed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Market it!: &lt;/strong&gt;We know about this stuff&amp;#8211;flyers, newsletters and social media to get the word out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; *&lt;em&gt;Deploy Volunteers: *&lt;/em&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll need lots of people to make it happen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it is the shining-star of Regatta, here&amp;#8217;s a short video featuring all the shenanigans that go down at the Chandos Lake Regatta.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ice cream brand strategy</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/ice-cream-brand-strategy/"/>
   <updated>2012-09-08T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/ice-cream-brand-strategy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9821/ice-cream-brand-strategy/attachment/img_1461&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9822&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-9822&quot; title=&quot;Pip at the Arrow&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_1461-580x580.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;580&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four ice-cream shops within walking distance of my house. They all sell good ice-cream from brands with a care for craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll walk by the two closest ones every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#8217;ll tell everyone who asks and a bunch of people who don&amp;#8217;t ask, to go to these spots too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The loyalty these companies inspire costs them nothing. So how do they get it in this jaded mass media era?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#8217;t give me friction when I ask for two flavours of the same size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been going to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whitesquirrelcoffee.com/&quot;&gt;White Squirrel&lt;/a&gt; (on Queen West across from Trinity Bellwoods park) for years. No matter how hectic it gets with sweaty hipsters lined up out the door and kids, families and dogs clogging the sidewalk with park-gear and bikes, the folks there always seem cool under fire. They&amp;#8217;re game to let you taste flavours, don&amp;#8217;t rush you and, of course, let you mix 2 flavours in your scoop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My new find, &lt;a href=&quot;http://thearrowcafe.com/&quot;&gt;the ARROW&lt;/a&gt;, On Dundas near Ossington serves &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mapletonsorganic.ca/what-is-organic/about-the-farm/&quot;&gt;Mapleton&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt;. In a visit last weekend, my youngest daughter licked half her scoop onto the floor. They gave her an entirely new cone. I was going to use her remaining half cone and have them dump another scoop on mine, but they wouldn&amp;#8217;t have it–they made me a full cone on top her remaining half cone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t think they process this strategically, but here&amp;#8217;s what&amp;#8217;s happening:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ice cream may be a commodity game, where the retailers aren&amp;#8217;t making huge margins on the already expensive premium ice-cream. But these businesses put solid people on the front line and empower them to focus on helping the customers experience awesomeness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe awesomeness sounds like too big of an idea for an ice cream shop, but the point is that they&amp;#8217;re looking for opportunities to make the experience noteworthy and memorable. And frankly, the pervasive lack of this consideration at other places makes their effort stand out all the more starkly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you considered whether your touch-points offer memorable experiences? Turns out there&amp;#8217;s a pretty fine line between being irrelevant and being championed by your customer (constituents, clients, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Champlain Leaves Behind a Trail of Lakes</title>

  &lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-9817&quot; title=&quot;Champlain Trail Lakes&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ChamplainTrailLakes-580x654.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Champlain Trail Lakes&quot; width=&quot;464&quot; height=&quot;523&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While exploring the Ottawa River, French explorer &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_de_Champlain&quot;&gt;Samuel de Champlain&lt;/a&gt; canoed across a series of lakes that came to be known as the Champlain Trail Lakes. He was a pretty swell guy, attempting to make better relations with local native tribes, as well as establishing the French settlement which we now know as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ville.quebec.qc.ca/en/&quot;&gt;Quebec City&lt;/a&gt;. He was also the first European to fully explore and describe the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes&quot;&gt;Great Lakes&lt;/a&gt; by creating maps and accounts of what he had learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is this art (navigation) that drew me to love the sea at a very young age and that compelled me to challenge its treacherous waters all of my life and that made me navigate and follow the coast of parts of America . . . &amp;#8211; Samuel de Champlain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>You know what depletes fish stocks?</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a beautiful, informative and compelling four minute run down on the consequences of our industrial approach to fishing. As you might imagine, it&amp;#8217;s unsustainable in the starkest meaning of the term–it can&amp;#8217;t last. If you knew you were going to running out of something you wanted/needed, wouldn&amp;#8217;t you ration it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know we&amp;#8217;re all busy picking back up after a hectic summer, but the organizations who are profitting by destroying eco-systems, livelihoods and and cultural diets are depending on that. If nothing else, the following entertaining  video is an easy way to familiarize yourself with the details. Like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schoolhouserock.tv/&quot; title=&quot;School House Rock&quot;&gt;School House Rock&lt;/a&gt; said–&amp;#8221;Knowledge is power!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The campaign is also a special kind of call to action. It reminds us of the role cititizens play in the system–not only as consumers, which is important but limiting–but also as policy influencers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is the last day of &amp;#8220;European Fish Weeks 2012&amp;#8243;, a campaign by a coalition of 160+ member organizations whose mission is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;To ensure that the 2012 reform of the EU Common Fisheries Policy stops overfishing, ends destructive fishing practices and delivers fair and equitable use of healthy fish stocks.&lt;br&gt;
Our broad alliance of organisations employs scientific evidence and extensive experience in engaging decision-makers and stakeholders at all levels.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get a brief run down of the initiative from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slowfood.com/international/slow-stories/141488/ocean2012/q=20572D#.UEDUd0EOFoo.wordpress&quot;&gt;Slow Food International&lt;/a&gt;, one of the 5 international member organizations or you can head directly to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocean2012.eu/&quot;&gt;Ocean 2012 campaign home&lt;/a&gt; to find out more about the issue and solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Gamification For The Win</title>

  &lt;em&gt; Photo Credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://dribbble.com/jackietran&quot;&gt;Jackie Tran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m taking this course through &lt;a href=&quot;www.coursera.org&quot;&gt;Coursera&lt;/a&gt; entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/course/gamification&quot;&gt;Gamification&lt;/a&gt;. Like so many of you, I consider myself a &amp;#8220;gamer.&amp;#8221; Naturally I figured this course would be right up my alley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having had the liberty of attending a lecture by &lt;a href=&quot;http://janemcgonigal.com/&quot;&gt;Jane McGonigal&lt;/a&gt;, I had already been introduced to certain attributes of Gamification. She touched on why games make us better people, and how they can in fact change the world. Needless to say, I quickly developed an understanding of why we need to make time to play in our busy lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gamification itself is a fairly new concept that is growing at an exponential rate. It&amp;#8217;s not all &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goomba&quot;&gt;Goombas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.angrybirds.com/&quot;&gt;Projectiles&lt;/a&gt; like some of you may think. In fact, it&amp;#8217;s a sophisticated psychological take on how we interact with the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a well-thought-out combination of Game Elements, Techniques and Designs that are strategically placed in non-game applications and processes. The end result is a more engaging and effective learning experience. You also get &lt;a href=&quot;http://themushroomkingdom.net/sounds/wav/smw/smw_1-up.wav&quot;&gt;points&lt;/a&gt;. People like points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, in fact 3 categories to Gamification: External (marketing, sales, customer engagement), Internal (Productivity, Crowdsourcing), and my personal favourite, Behavioural Change (health and wellness, sustainability, and personal finance).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 2010, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vw.ca/en.html&quot;&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt; held a Competition (note the External Game Element in a Marketing setting) called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thefuntheory.com/&quot;&gt;The Fun Theory&lt;/a&gt;. The purpose was to come up with something &amp;#8220;fun&amp;#8221; that would make a positive change. The winner, Kevin Richardson, developed the Speed Camera Lottery to make a positive change in traffic safety. His idea was so good, that Volkswagen, together with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sweden.se/eng/Home/Society/Reading/Road-safety/&quot;&gt;The Swedish National Society for Road Safety&lt;/a&gt;, actually made this innovative idea a reality in Stockholm, Sweden. During a 3-day period, the overall driving speed dropped by 22%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Volkswagen and Kevin used various Game-like Elements to engage people, getting them to make a positive change in their behaviour, which in turn mades the roads safer for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you call it &lt;em&gt;Gamification&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Fun Theory&lt;/em&gt;, in the end its all about positive change. And of course, the points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus Question!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Have any of you seen traces of Gamification within your community? Leave a comment for 50 bonus points!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Is Your City A Brand? Damn Right it is!</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/9775/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/9775</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/branding/9775/9775/attachment/screen-shot-2012-08-30-at-2-45-46-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9782&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9782&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2012-08-30 at 2.45.46 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Screen-shot-2012-08-30-at-2.45.46-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;253&quot; height=&quot;192&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every brand touchpoint expresses an organization&amp;#8217;s values. This holds true even when the organization is the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve had some pretty incredible interactions with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/&quot;&gt;Toronto Public Library&lt;/a&gt; lately that have helped me see why it&amp;#8217;s vital to think of  your city as a brand. A city is a brand not just in the way Toronto currently thinks about branding&amp;#8212;attracting tourists by putting catchy slogans on bus shelters and the like. It&amp;#8217;s a living brand that its citizens engage in, daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who you vote for will determine your brand experience. That&amp;#8217;s why you need to be very clear about the kind of city you want to live in and use your vote to bring that brand to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, back to the Toronto Public Library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently went through some personal stuff that put returning library books low on my priority list. The fact that the books were overdue was on my radar, but frankly it was just one more thing stressing me out among all of the other much more pressing things I needed to deal with just to get through the day.&amp;lt;!--more--&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When visited the library to return the books I realized I was facing $47 in fines. &lt;em&gt;Yikes.&lt;/em&gt;  Yes, I deserved those fines. Those books were overdue (not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; overdue, jeez!). It was totally my bad. But life got in the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spoke to two nice, but rather rigid librarians (librarians don&amp;#8217;t tend to be known as the most relaxed-types pardon the stereotyping). But, because I&amp;#8217;m a &amp;#8216;squeaky wheel&amp;#8217; type, I kept going up the chain until I spoke with a head librarian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She realized I had something weighty on my mind, and so she invited me to step into a private office office. Once safely inside I explained some of the life-circumstance that resulted in me returning the books later than usual. She took the time to listen. She heard me out and  demonstrated copious amounts of empathy. She not only reduced my fines, she made  a point of reaching beyond her role as &amp;#8216;librarian&amp;#8217; and showing a very human side. She said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Sometimes returning your library books isn&amp;#8217;t at the top of the priority list.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In bothering to express that, she reminded me of the fact that all city workers are the front line people who make up much of the fabric of our city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I tell you this story is to demonstrate that this librarian was acting in a manner very out of step with the Ford-nation platform that sees &amp;#8220;service level efficiencies&amp;#8221; as the be-all-and-end -all to running an effective government. In an efficient system like the one Ford envisions, I&amp;#8217;d have paid my $47, eaten my humble pie and maybe learned a lesson or two about following the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my version of the story however, I was proud to be a citizen who lived in a place operated by people who actually care about other human beings. I&amp;#8217;d even go so far to hypothesize that if more citizens felt the way I did on that day, fewer people would throw gum on the sidewalk, do stuff like be rude to Transit workers and abuse the system. Hell, they may even throw a block party, plant flowers on public property and make donations to &lt;a href=&quot;http://tplfoundation.ca/&quot;&gt;The Toronto Public Library Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s remember, there needs to be a human dimension to our city and the people who are the front-line workers who interface with its citizens are not simply efficiencies that need to be cut to serve the bottom line. They are core to the brand experience. They are central to citizens&amp;#8217; (yours and mine) experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you want the Toronto brand to be? Should &amp;#8216;human&amp;#8217; be one of the adjectives in the Toronto brand creative brief? Because if Mayor Ford has his way,  words like &amp;#8216;efficient&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;responsible&amp;#8217; would make the list, and human and empathic would not.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Damn Good Advice: Getting the most out of your designer</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/damn-good-advice-getting-the-most-out-of-your-designer/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/damn-good-advice-getting-the-most-out-of-your-designer</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/damn-good-advice/9758/damn-good-advice-paying-for-design-work/attachment/damngoodadvice2&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9766&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9766&quot; title=&quot;damngoodadvice2&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/damngoodadvice2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Damn Good Advice logo &quot; width=&quot;382&quot; height=&quot;201&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning I found a new comment on an old post of a video I&amp;#8217;d shared from my phone, without anything but a title, because I felt that it spoke for itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To respond to the comment more usefully, I watched the video again. It still speaks for itself, but it inspires plenty of consideration. Here&amp;#8217;s the (short) video again for reference, followed by five lessons it inspires for getting the most out of your designer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;posterous_autopost&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &amp;nbsp;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/h3&gt;
  
  &lt;h2&gt;
    You can&amp;#8217;t step in the same river twice
  &lt;/h2&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Case in point, simply watching the video again inspired a series of considerations and a new blog post. When you see something for the second time, you&amp;#8217;re looking at it with fresh eyes.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Even if you&amp;#8217;ve only just watched it, you&amp;#8217;ve been changed for having done so.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &amp;nbsp;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/h3&gt;
  
  &lt;h2&gt;
    Solving communications problems is a means to an end, not an end in itself
  &lt;/h2&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    One of the most striking points the video makes is how, given little time, everyone&amp;#8217;s first idea is the same.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    If you can see the answer before you&amp;#8217;ve spent time doing some design thinking on it, chances are you&amp;#8217;ve got a recipe for irrelevance. Blending in. Being ignored.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    It may be cheaper/quicker to come up with the obvious solution in the short term, but that&amp;#8217;s thinking about your communications challenges as expenses instead of investments, and that deal won&amp;#8217;t look so great when it doesn&amp;#8217;t actually solve your problem.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &amp;nbsp;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/h3&gt;
  
  &lt;h2&gt;
    Great ideas come from perspective
  &lt;/h2&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    The reason more time yields better results is that it give designers a chance to reframe the problem. Like (the inspiring) Dorothea Brande said:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;#8220;A problem clearly stated is a problem half solved&amp;#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Designers have many tactics for getting fresh perspective–by making connections through research, by making things real in draft form and iterating on them, etc–all of which take time.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &amp;nbsp;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/h3&gt;
  
  &lt;h2&gt;
    A lot of work goes into making things look &amp;#8216;simple&amp;#8217;
  &lt;/h2&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    This is another take on the way the kids come up with the same solution given the short time frame.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Many people assume something is simple because they&amp;#8217;ve seen something similar somewhere else. We&amp;#8217;re all inundated with so much media that we&amp;#8217;re conscious of visual tropes, feel like we know what we&amp;#8217;re after. And because even a layman can recognize these conventions, we assume they&amp;#8217;re easy to easy to execute.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    The reality is that the aesthetics we recognize, are comfortable with and accept as appropriate are from magazines, movies and brands with big budgets. They&amp;#8217;ve spent the money on research, strategy, design and production to net out at that perfectly articulated idea in your head.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &amp;nbsp;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/h3&gt;
  
  &lt;h2&gt;
    Client insight + designer&amp;#8217;s unique perspective = magic
  &lt;/h2&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    The range of conceptual and aesthetic variations the kids arrive at when given the time reminds us that getting good work is as much about chemistry as anything else. If you only want designers to execute your vision, you&amp;#8217;re using a fraction of what they have to offer.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Designers spend ALL of their time solving problems. From framing them to agonizing over minutiae in their execution. Their hands offer much more when working in sync with their hearts and minds.  So talk to yours about your goals and define the challenge together. You may find that you were solving the wrong problem.

   <title>A Bunch of Weirdo Hippies at Cedar Lake</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/9761/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/9761</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/ontario-lakes-project/9761/9761/attachment/cedarlake&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9768&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9768&quot; title=&quot;cedarlake&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/cedarlake.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;291&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are at least 18 lakes named Cedar Lake in Ontario so it&amp;#8217;s hard to say which one the 70&amp;#8242;s folk group &amp;#8220;Cedar Lake&amp;#8221; was named for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The folk band included Canadian music luminaries like brothers &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/stan-rogers&quot;&gt;Stan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.enotes.com/rogers-garnet-reference/rogers-garnet&quot;&gt;Garnet Rogers&lt;/a&gt; and a host of other well-known folkies. The band had about 20 members at its peak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways the band sounds like an old-fashioned version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brokensocialscene.ca/&quot;&gt;Broken Social Scene.&lt;/a&gt; But the band was more broken than on the scene. They lasted less than a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.enotes.com/rogers-garnet-reference/rogers-garnet&quot;&gt;online bio on Garnet Rogers,&lt;/a&gt; Rogers told the &lt;em&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt; that the band Cedar Lake consisted of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;A bunch of complete and utter lunatics, really disgusting, underrehearsed weirdo hippies, most of whom have found well-deserved obscurity.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds like an awesome band. In fact, I think they need to stage a revival at&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.casinorama.com/&quot;&gt; Casinorama&lt;/a&gt; some time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

This instructional video on building a campfire filmed at &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Cecebe&quot;&gt;Lake Cecebe&lt;/a&gt; in the Parry Sound District is most certainly the most &lt;em&gt;fool proo&lt;/em&gt;f method I&amp;#8217;ve ever seen.  Ironically, it might be one of the more foolish things I&amp;#8217;ve ever seen.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It opens with the line &amp;#8220;How much gas is too much gas?&amp;#8221; and goes downhill from there. Enjoy, and please don&amp;#8217;t try this at home.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My New-ish Favourite App: Path</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/my-new-ish-favourite-app-path/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-23T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/my-new-ish-favourite-app-path</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9738&quot; style=&quot;border: none!important;&quot; title=&quot;path_1&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/path_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Platform:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iOS, Android (I use it on my iPhone 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it&amp;#8217;s for:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://path.com&quot;&gt;Path&lt;/a&gt; is a &amp;#8220;closed&amp;#8221; social network, to stay connected with your close friends &amp;amp; family. It acts as a journal of your life, where you can post, where you are, what you&amp;#8217;re doing, who you&amp;#8217;re with, and include a photo or video. It also sports a section for sharing what music you&amp;#8217;re listening to, what movie you&amp;#8217;re watching, or what book you&amp;#8217;re reading. &lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-9739&quot; title=&quot;path_2&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/path_2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;135&quot; height=&quot;132&quot; /&gt;For the athletes out there, you can also sync it with your Nike Fuelband to keep track of your running/jogging/walking milage. Your &amp;#8220;path&amp;#8221; is only accessible to those whom you&amp;#8217;ve accepted as a friend. Unlike Twitter, where you&amp;#8217;re encouraged to openly share with everyone, and Facebook where you feel obliged to be friends with your entire school&amp;#8217;s student body, Path has a slightly more personal touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides posting things, you also have the ability to include a &amp;#8220;reaction&amp;#8221; of sorts, on to other people&amp;#8217;s posts. You can include a little &amp;#8220;emotion&amp;#8221;, regarding how you feel about a specific post, as well as a regular comment. The last neat feature is a button to post when you&amp;#8217;re going to sleep and when you&amp;#8217;ve just woken up. At first, the notion of sharing this seems a little creepy, but I&amp;#8217;ve found it to be a nice feature to keep track of my sleeping patterns. Upon &amp;#8220;waking up&amp;#8221; in Path, it gives you the current weather conditions and temperature, as well as a log of how many hours you slept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why I like it:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-9740&quot; title=&quot;path_3&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/path_3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;135&quot; height=&quot;132&quot; /&gt;Although I use and enjoy both Twitter, and Facebook, Path offers a slightly more personal and intimate experience. With my entire immediate family on it, I&amp;#8217;ve enjoyed things like seeing my brother post all sorts of checkins and photos on a vacation he took with his fiancé in Nova Scotia, or my Mom frowing at me when I eat fast food, or my Dad&amp;#8217;s updates on his latest golf game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also sports a very clean, and easy to use interface, with lots of neat interactions. Admittedly, I occasionally spend too much time opening and closing the main menu, just to watch the animation toggle. Everything is pretty straightforward to use, and as a nice touch you can additionally push your posts to other social networks like Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr and Foursquare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What could be better:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, Path only exists on mobile devices. The interface is sleek on the phones, but has a lot of potential for a different, web based layouts. When you share Path posts on other social networks, you get a look at that one post, but there&amp;#8217;s no way to see all of you and your friend&amp;#8217;s posts online in your browser. Although I suspect that it is partially my phones fault (the iPhone 4 is now almost two generations old, and I probably have too much stuff on it), but when I active the built-in camera in Path, it always takes a little longer than I like for it to fire up. Often, you&amp;#8217;ll want a really quick snap of something to share, and I&amp;#8217;ve missed a couple owing to the slowness of it. I&amp;#8217;m interested to see how it is on an iPhone 4S, or on the soon to be released iPhone 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who else might benefit from it:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who wants to share moments with only the people they want will love this app. On Path, it&amp;#8217;s not how many people you are friends with, but the quality of people, and the moments you share with them. It&amp;#8217;s especially great for travellers &amp;amp; vacationers who want to instantly share their trip&amp;#8217;s ongoings with friends and family. However you use it, Path is a great app to stay connected with those who matter to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Where do I get it?:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://path.com&quot;&gt;Path&lt;/a&gt; is freely available to download and use from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/path/id403639508?mt=8&quot;&gt;Apple App Store&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.path&quot;&gt;Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Competitors or Partners? Why Working Together Makes More Good</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/9735/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-23T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/9735</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9735/9735/attachment/screen-shot-2012-08-24-at-10-58-23-am&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9745&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9745&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2012-08-24 at 10.58.23 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Screen-shot-2012-08-24-at-10.58.23-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;410&quot; height=&quot;311&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#8217;t brag often. But I&amp;#8217;m feeling pretty chuffed so please allow me the liberty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Hypenotic came along, Fiesta Farms didn&amp;#8217;t have a website—as in &lt;em&gt;none at all.&lt;/em&gt; One day when I was checking out my groceries I asked the lovely cashier to please page Mr. Virgona (the owner). He came down, we talked and the rest is history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re really proud of the website and the amazing work &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.swallowfood.com/about-us/&quot;&gt;Ivy Knight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://torontogardens.blogspot.ca/&quot;&gt;Sarah Battersby&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://andreachiu.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Andrea Chiu&lt;/a&gt; do every day to bring the website and social media platforms to life with incredible content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#8217;s a different story. I&amp;#8217;m not here to brag about the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to share the joys of making amazing stuff happen &lt;em&gt;offline.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the strategy phase of our work we defined a nine point platform that I won&amp;#8217;t bore you with here. What I will tell you is that core to that strategy is &amp;#8220;sup­port­ing &lt;em&gt;entrepreneurs&lt;/em&gt; because evo­lu­tion and inno­va­tion are as impor­tant as his­tory and culture.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks back we co-hosted an event with entrepreneurs that we&amp;#8217;re particularly proud to be linking arms with. We brought &lt;a href=&quot;http://fiestafarms.ca/&quot;&gt;Fiesta Farms&lt;/a&gt; together with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://westendfood.coop/&quot;&gt;The West End Food Coop&lt;/a&gt; to host a group of twenty people for an awesome evening of Tomato Canning.  The event was dubbed &lt;a href=&quot;http://fiestafarms.ca/category/tomatofest&quot;&gt;Tomatofest,&lt;/a&gt; and it was a huge smashing success on many fronts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part was that these two partners came together to make it happen. The West End Food Coop provided the incredible canning expertise honed through their experience running &lt;a href=&quot;http://westendfood.coop/cannery&quot;&gt;the Community Cannery&lt;/a&gt;. Fiesta Farms provided space under the canopy of the garden centre and provided funding for equipment and sponsorship to make the event happen. They also provided loads of incredibly delicious snacks to keep the troops energized throughout the long tomato sauce making process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one level you could consider these two competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all  the West End Food Coop&amp;#8217;s Food Hub is set to open in a couple of months and it will be a grocery store that is (according to googlemaps) only 4.2 kms or 9 minutes drive from Fiesta Farms&amp;#8217; store. Like Fiesta Farms, the West End Food Coop&amp;#8217;s Food Hub/store will feature lots of fresh, local food. On the surface, two grocery stores serving the same general neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there are big differences between the two (Fiesta is a private business, West End Food Coop is a Cooperative) but there are some key similarities on a values level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So then the question arises: Why should two organizations (who could be considered competitors) work together?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glad you asked. Here&amp;#8217;s why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;They bring different things to the table.&lt;/strong&gt; Fiesta had the physical space and the financial resources to make an event like this possible. Fiesta&amp;#8217;s resources helped the Coop buy some of the canning equipment they need to do canning events in the future. West End Food Coop has killer canning expertise and knowledge. They don&amp;#8217;t have space yet (but they will really, really soon).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;They can help each other.&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#8217;s wrong-minded to think that there&amp;#8217;s a finite number of people out there who want to shop for good food and they&amp;#8217;ll &lt;em&gt;either&lt;/em&gt; shop at Fiesta Farms &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; at the West End Food Coop. With more partners like these working together, more people will crave good food and be able to access it. Together, they grow the good food movement which will mean more good food for everyone. That has benefits beyond just these two partners like local farmers, food processors, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Their communities of interest overlap.&lt;/strong&gt; If Fiesta&amp;#8217;s customers don&amp;#8217;t know about the West End Food Coop, well, they should. And they should also&lt;a href=&quot;https://westendfood.coop/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&amp;amp;id=7&quot;&gt; buy bonds &lt;/a&gt;to make the Coop a reality. There was a table set up at the canning event just for that purpose. On the other hand, if the people committed to the West End Food Coop&amp;#8217;s vision want to make their garden lush or need some grocery staples they can&amp;#8217;t find at the Coop, they should know about Fiesta Farms. It turns out that the people who came out to the event (which sold out in 2 days) heard about it both through Fiesta Farms&amp;#8217; and West End Food Coops&amp;#8217; channels. In short, these two groups should be better acquainted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this all sounds a bit academic the event itself was anything but. It was a joyful mashup of awesome people making something wonderful happen. And they all walked away with jars of Tomato Sauce and a sense that these two organizations know how to play nicely together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a taste of what went down that night check out the slideshow, and stay tuned for more news about all that&amp;#8217;s happening on the Fiesta Farms and West End Food Coop Fronts.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Catchacoma Flapper: Ontario Lakes Project</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/ontario-lakes-project/9703/the-catchacoma-flapper-ontario-lakes-project/attachment/cachacoma&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9719&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/ontario-lakes-project/9703/the-catchacoma-flapper-ontario-lakes-project/attachment/cachacoma_l&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9722&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-9722&quot; title=&quot;Cachacoma_l&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Cachacoma_l-580x279.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;279&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/ontario-lakes-project/9703/the-catchacoma-flapper-ontario-lakes-project/attachment/cachacoma&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9719&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very sweet, 1920&amp;#8242;s black and white style video called Catchacoma Flapper about taking a dip in Catchacoma Lake in the Kawartha Highlands. It&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Super-8&amp;#8243; look can&amp;#8217;t help but make you feel happy and reminisce about a simpler, sweeter time when men and women donned their &amp;#8220;swimming costumes&amp;#8221; and joyfully took to the waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This video gives rise to the question, did flappers actually swim? Well, here are some important facts that confirm that yes, indeed Gertrude,  those rebellious ladies of the 1920s knew how to do the backstroke:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  American &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/01/sports/gertrude-ederle-the-first-woman-to-swim-across-the-english-channel-dies-at-98.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;src=pm&quot;&gt;Gertrude Ederle&lt;/a&gt; became the first woman to swim across the English Channel in 1926&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  At the 1920 summer Olympics &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethelda_Bleibtrey&quot;&gt;Ethelda Bleibtrey&lt;/a&gt; won three gold metals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Also in 1920, Australian swimmer &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annette_Kellerman&quot;&gt;Annette Kellerman&lt;/a&gt; won the ladies&amp;#8217; 100 yards and mile championships of New South Wales in the record time&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Damn Good Advice. Make Good Art</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/damn-good-advice-make-good-art/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/damn-good-advice-make-good-art</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Damn Good Advice&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/damngoodadvice2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Damn Good Advice&quot; width=&quot;382&quot; height=&quot;201&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi Everyone! I&amp;#8217;m Amanda, and I&amp;#8217;m new here at Hypenotic. I thought it would be a great idea to introduce myself with a bit of &lt;em&gt;Damn Good Advice&lt;/em&gt;. I don&amp;#8217;t want to just give you simple advice like “Don’t cut your own bangs” or, “Careful, Robin. Both hands on the Bat-Rope.”  Instead, I&amp;#8217;m going to tell you what I learned from one of the best creatives and mentors out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neil Gaiman&amp;#8217;s speech addressing the 2012 graduating class of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uarts.edu/&quot;&gt;University of the Arts in Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt; featured on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brainpickings.org/&quot;&gt;Brain Pickings&lt;/a&gt; really struck a chord with me. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neilgaiman.com/&quot;&gt;Neil Gaiman&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; a spectacular author who, as he likes to put it, &amp;#8220;makes things up and writes them down.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s written such novels as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neilgaiman.com/works/Books/Coraline/&quot;&gt;Coraline&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neilgaiman.com/works/Books/American+Gods/&quot;&gt;American Gods&lt;/a&gt; (my personal favorite), and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neilgaiman.com/works/Books/Stardust/&quot;&gt;Stardust.&lt;/a&gt; He’s kind of a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neil’s bit of &lt;em&gt;Damn Good Advice&lt;/em&gt; for the graduates (and everyone, really) is simple: Make Good Art. And make it especially when things are rough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He advises those who don’t feel that they are inherently creative to ignore that feeling and just do it! Or at the very least, enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that the very root of art is a form of expression, which can be anything really. Foodie? Make a good sandwich. Or at the very least, enjoy a good sandwich. You’ll be happier because of it (true fact: sandwiches make everything better). It really boils down to doing what you love, whatever that may be, especially when things aren’t exactly where you want them to be. So here&amp;#8217;s what Neil Gaiman has to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes life is hard. Things go wrong — and in life, and in love, and in business, and in friendship, and in health, and in all the other ways in which life can go wrong. And when things get tough, this is what you should do: Make good art. I’m serious. Husband runs off with a politician? Make good art. Leg crushed and then eaten by a mutated boa constrictor? Make good art. IRS on your trail? Make good art. Cat exploded? Make good art. Someone on the internet thinks what you’re doing is stupid, or evil, or it’s all been done before? Make good art … Go and make interesting mistakes, make amazing mistakes, make glorious and fantastic mistakes. Break rules. Leave the world more interesting for your being here. Make. Good. Art.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you have it, make good art, or at the very least find something you love to do and really enjoy it. Oh and seriously, don’t cut your own bangs.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Coffee, Beer &#038; The Fuck You Economy</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/coffee-beer-and-the-fuck-you-economy/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/coffee-beer-and-the-fuck-you-economy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I tell people I&amp;#8217;m a coffee snob when they ask why I need to buy coffee from independents instead of Tim Horton&amp;#8217;s or McDonalds. And I tell people I&amp;#8217;m a beer snob as a shorthand explanation for why I choose craft beer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#8217;m not a snob. I&amp;#8217;m discerning. The difference is that I&amp;#8217;m conscious of the value of what I&amp;#8217;m paying for. And while chain coffee and commercial beer might boast a lower price tag, they&amp;#8217;re still ripping me off. It&amp;#8217;s like a mandate. They&amp;#8217;re in the business of figuring out how to create margins anywhere they can, as long as the customers will still buy it and their risk assessments say they can handle it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I understand it, McDonald&amp;#8217;s improved their coffee a couple of years ago when they realized that sucking a bit less could help them take some market share back from Timmie&amp;#8217;s. But the focus is on how little they can get away with rather than how much they can afford to include.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an economic mindset that focuses on short term shareholder returns instead of long term stakeholder value, the approach makes sense. But I&amp;#8217;ve never been able to get my head around buying from people who are doing their best to screw me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s like I&amp;#8217;m grudgingly saying,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ll buy this because it&amp;#8217;s cheap and convenient&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and they&amp;#8217;re smiling and saying&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;go fuck yourself, come again!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think people get this when it comes to a lot of products. You want better fidelity in your speakers or headphones? Get to know the components, try out a bunch, and buy yourself a pair once every few years. But I find it odd that people who drink coffee multiple times/day and beer weekly don&amp;#8217;t stop to consider what they&amp;#8217;re consuming. Is what you put in your ears more important than what you put in your mouth? Or is it that the things you buy the most often are the things you consider the least? It doesn&amp;#8217;t add up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunting down independent coffee shops and craft beers could be considered less convenient, but I&amp;#8217;m increasingly realizing that convenience is over-rated, and has largely been sold to us as a benefit by people making and selling sub-par alternatives. Seeking these things out from someone who differentiate by their careful selection of ingredients and process offers all kinds of returns we&amp;#8217;re not accounting for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  You often get to know the maker, someone who works for the organization, or someone who cares enough about it to stock it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  They taste better. Or at least they don&amp;#8217;t all taste the same&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  You&amp;#8217;re contributing to a culture of improvement–people want to make things better for you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Your&amp;#8217;re usually supporting local entrepreneurs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list goes on, but you get the point. We all choose what consumption we do consciously and where provenance, craft and impact get ignored. I&amp;#8217;d just like to leave you with two questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; If more of us were conscious about more consumption considerations, would it lead to a more sustainable/generative economy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; If you were going to be more conscious about one thing, wouldn&amp;#8217;t food make sense?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Cat Lake is The Epicentre of Prescription Drug Addiction in Canada: Ontario Lakes Project</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9678/cat-lake-is-the-epicentre-of-prescription-drug-addiction-in-canada-ontario-lakes-project/attachment/cat&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9695&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9695&quot; title=&quot;cat&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/cat.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;341&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cat Lake is known as &amp;#8220;the epicentre for prescription drug addiction in Canada&amp;#8221; where it is estimated that 70 to 80 percent of the adult population is addicted to OxyContin or Percocets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January this sad reality led Cat Lake to declare a state of emergency. First Nations&amp;#8217; Chief Matthew Keewaykapow asked the Canadian Government for help, pleading:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The situation is beyond our current band resources and we require immediate and long term assistance from our federal and provincial partners.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current wait list for First Nations seeking treatment ranges from 40 days to six months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
   Last month the Chief with his partner and six-year-old son went on a 100km canoe trip to raise funds for drug treatment in his community. The Chief said:
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &amp;#8220;By travelling with my partner and son on this journey, I want to share hope with my fellow community members. Cat Lake has a future beyond the drug abuse.”

   <title>J &#038; J Tells Me &#8220;You&#8217;re Ok Mom&#8221; and I Weep</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/9684/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/9684</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s near impossible to relax when you&amp;#8217;re under attack. But parents are facing just this challenge. This summer there have been a plethora of articles telling parents they need to &amp;#8216;chill&amp;#8217; at the same time that they&amp;#8217;re being told that, frankly, they are doing a shitty job. So shitty a job, in fact, that their kids are the most screwed up in generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New Yorker started the ball rolling with asking &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2012/07/02/120702crbo_books_kolbert&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;Why Are American Kids so Spoiled?&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; And the answer is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“with the exception of the imperial offspring of the Ming dynasty and the dauphins of pre-Revolutionary France, contemporary American kids may represent the most indulged young people in the history of the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Globe and Mail has been wielding a similar sword, swinging like crazy at parents&amp;#8217; jugulars while again, telling them their far too uptight. The Globe asked &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/parenting/are-our-pampered-kids-under-too-much-pressure/article4459296/&quot;&gt;Are Our Pampered Kids Under Too Much Pressure?&lt;/a&gt; and also offered advice about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/parenting/why-parents-should-add-relax-to-their-to-do-list/article4393308/&quot;&gt;Why Parents Should Add &amp;#8220;Relax&amp;#8221; To Their To Do List.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light on all this, this Johnson and Johnson ad is spot on. In classical advertising terms it exploits a truth. This truth has nothing to do with J &amp;amp; J&amp;#8217;s products, but the fact that this little message is brought to you by a major corporation that sells toxic soap (among &lt;a href=&quot;http://jezebel.com/5877877/johnson--johnson-claims-to-help-moms-while-still-pushing-dangerous-products&quot;&gt;a litany of other horrors to mothers and babes&lt;/a&gt;) is of course more than a little sad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes to show you the state of affairs for parents who are being consistently told they&amp;#8217;re doing it all wrong. I can&amp;#8217;t help crying every time I hear &amp;#8220;you&amp;#8217;re not perfect&amp;#8230;.but you&amp;#8217;re trying.&amp;#8221;  I&amp;#8217;m glad someone, even an evil empire, is recognizing my parenting chops.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Pinkalicious Makes Me Puke!</title>

   <updated>2012-07-31T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/pinkalicious-you-make-me-puke</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9666/pinkalicious-you-make-me-puke/attachment/screen-shot-2012-07-31-at-10-20-24-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9667&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9667&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2012-07-31 at 10.20.24 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Screen-shot-2012-07-31-at-10.20.24-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;392&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thinkpinkalicious.com/books&quot;&gt;Pinkalicious&lt;/a&gt; is a very below average kids book. It really is. And it was a bloody horrible play (Come ON. It sucked! What made me buy tickets to that particular show?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet Pinkalicous is a massive, &lt;em&gt;massive&lt;/em&gt; empire. It&amp;#8217;s been around for about six years, and within that short time they&amp;#8217;ve spun off 25 books and an endless line of licensed products. There&amp;#8217;s a bike, backpack, bedding, pajamas, games, cards, birthday party paraphernalia,  You can buy Pinkalicious stuff at Walmart, Barnes &amp;amp; Noble, Borders, FAO Schwarz, Toys R Us, Kohl&amp;#8217;s, Sears Canada, Saks, Bloomingdale&amp;#8217;s and Neiman Marcus.  It was on &lt;em&gt;Broadway&lt;/em&gt;. Seriously, WTF?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After re-reading one of the spin off books to my daughter tonight I started to wonder: Had authors &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thinkpinkalicious.com/victoria&quot;&gt;Victoria and Elizabeth Kahn &lt;/a&gt;made a deal with the devil?  Well, not the devil but a licensing firm called &lt;a href=&quot;http://joesterloriagroup.com/pinkalicious/&quot;&gt;Joester Loria Group&lt;/a&gt;. Still, what is the secret to this mediocre books&amp;#8217; massive success? Sadly, there&amp;#8217;s no secret, salacious story (at least not one I can uncover). The secret is something far more obvious, and in some ways more sinister: Pinkalicious represents the sweetest sweet spot in marketing to young girls who are marketers&amp;#8217; favourite new targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peggy Orenstein has made a career of critiquing marketing to girls. In her latest book &lt;a href=&quot;http://peggyorenstein.com/books/cinderella.html&quot;&gt;Cinderella Ate My Daughter: Dispatches from the Front Lines of the New Girlie-Girl Culture&lt;/a&gt; she goes off in search of what the pink obsession is really all about. When she headed to New York&amp;#8217;s annual toy fair she was stunned by the proliferation of pink:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Is all this pink really necessary?&amp;#8221; I asked a bored-looking sales rep hawking something called Cast and Paint Princess Party. &amp;#8220;Only if you want to make money,&amp;#8221; he said, chuckling. Then he shrugged. &amp;#8220;I guess girls are born loving pink.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orentstein goes on to contradict the pink biological imperative, finding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; It was not until the mid-1980s, when amplifying age and sex differences became a dominant children&amp;#8217;s marketing strategy, that pink fully came into its own, when it began to seem innately attractive to girls, part of what defined them as female, at least for the first few critical years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Literary mediocrity has little effect on the power of pink and its appeal to young girls. Young girls are a &lt;em&gt;massive&lt;/em&gt; target and so are their parents. Pinkalicious hits that sweet spot&amp;#8211;not &amp;#8220;babyish&amp;#8221; like Disney princesses, not too grown up like Hannah Montana. Pinkalicious is a much needed mascot for the 5-8 set. Not too sweet, not too saucy. She friggin perfect. And she sucks, hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of saucy, check out Burger King&amp;#8217;s partnership with Pinkalicious selling burgers to peckish little girls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re interested in keeping up with trends in marketing to girls, I suggest you check out some of these sites that make it their business to watch the marketers try and sell their pink&amp;#8230;.and blue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that there&amp;#8217;s value in watching. Blogs like Sociological Images act as a kind of watchdog and have lead companies like Abercrombie and Fitch to &lt;a href=&quot;http://jjie.org/amid-debate-abercrombie-reconsiders-selling-pushup-bras-yearolds/11883&quot;&gt;stop marketing padded bras to 7 year olds&lt;/a&gt; (oh.my.god). So get watching.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Damn Good Advice: Taking a nap can improve your sex life</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/damn-good-advice-taking-a-nap-to-improve-your-sex-life/"/>
   <updated>2012-07-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/damn-good-advice-taking-a-nap-to-improve-your-sex-life</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_9658&quot; style=&quot;width: 370px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9658&quot; title=&quot;Rick takes a catnap&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/catnap-e1343742978930.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;360&quot; height=&quot;380&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    Rick sleeping on our old sofa. Come by the studio to see the new one!
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recently got a &lt;a href=&quot;http://gusmodern.com/products1/sofas/jane-bisectional/jane-bisectional.shtml#jane-bisectional&quot;&gt;new sofa&lt;/a&gt; at Hypenotic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is great for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; We&amp;#8217;re hoping our clients will feel more comfortable and welcome when they visit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; It is guaranteed to vastly improve my daily nap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. I have a ritual siesta almost daily in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It usually kicks in around 1or 2pm. I feel sluggish, my screen starts to appear blurry and I lose all focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s when I know it&amp;#8217;s time to give in to the sofa&amp;#8217;s siren call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My nap isn&amp;#8217;t long. Only 12 minutes, generally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when I wake up, I feel refreshed, clear headed and I have a burst of energy to get me through the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s three steps I take to ensure a successful nap&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Set my timer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use the clock app that comes with the iPhone to set a count-down timer I also sometimes use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/minimalist-timer/id487145086?mt=8&quot;&gt;Minimalist Timer app&lt;/a&gt;. Its simple design can be operated easily with one finger and has 3 pre-sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Choose a good alarm&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They key thing is to make sure the alarm is something jarring, something that will pull me out of my deep slumber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve found the crickets chirping works well because it&amp;#8217;s completely out of context for an afternoon in the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Keep it short&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve found 12 minutes is usually just the right amount of time to make me feel alert and focussed afterward. It&amp;#8217;s long enough to enable my brain to have a little shut-off time, and short enough that I don&amp;#8217;t get sucked into wanting to sleep the day away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.besthealthmag.ca/embrace-life/sleep/19-reasons-to-take-a-nap&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt;, the benefits of napping are many. Napping can even increase your sex drive (though I suggest you wait till after work to test that one).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you aren&amp;#8217;t napping in the afternoon, perhaps its time to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you&amp;#8217;re not napping because your&amp;#8217;e afraid of what your boss will say, show them that blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What boss wouldn&amp;#8217;t want their employees to &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.besthealthmag.ca/embrace-life/sleep/19-reasons-to-take-a-nap&quot;&gt;i&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #423839; font-family: Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.besthealthmag.ca/embrace-life/sleep/19-reasons-to-take-a-nap&quot;&gt;ncrease your on-the-job alertness by 100 percent?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ontario Lakes Project: I&#8217;ve Had the Time of My Life at Carson Lake</title>

   <id>http://getpoole.com/ontario-lakes-project-ive-had-the-time-of-my-life-at-carson-lake</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9606/ontario-lakes-project-ive-had-the-time-of-my-life-at-carson-lake/attachment/carsonlake-2&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9649&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9649&quot; title=&quot;carsonlake&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/carsonlake1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;312&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.carsonscamp.on.ca/&quot;&gt;Carson&amp;#8217;s Camp&lt;/a&gt; on Carson Lake at Sauble Beach has that Dirty Dancing Resort vibe. The place has a full-time recreation director whose job it is to organize activities for kids and families. The whole summer is organized into weekly themes. It&amp;#8217;s just like Kellerman&amp;#8217;s Resort in Dirty Dancing where Baby met Penny and Johnny and there was dancing and friendship and teen sex and&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t get me started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could write a whole Master&amp;#8217;s thesis on Dirty Dancing. Actually, I did. Don&amp;#8217;t believe me? &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.ca/books/about/Nobody_Puts_Baby_In_a_Corner.html?id=EiMQuAAACAAJ&amp;amp;redir_esc=y&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s where you can get it&lt;/a&gt; and read all about it yourself. Ohio State, Women&amp;#8217;s Studies 1996 baby. Because of my thesis &amp;#8220;Nobobdy Puts Baby in a Corner: Hybridity and Female Desire in Dirty Dancing,&amp;#8221; I&amp;#8217;m an expert in all-inclusive North American family oriented resorts, musicals and feminism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like the good life at Kellerman&amp;#8217;s, at Carson&amp;#8217;s Camp there&amp;#8217;s an indoor pool, an outdoor pool and BINGO, horseshoe pits, 3 playgrounds, golf practice nets, shuffleboard courts, chess &amp;amp; checkers courts, a beach volleyball court, basketball court and billiards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may even find a hidden-away shack where scantily clan teens illicitly bump and grind until the wee hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, you&amp;#8217;ll have the time of your life. But be sure to use birth control&amp;#8230;.remember what happened to Penny?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week at Carson&amp;#8217;s Lake is themed &amp;#8220;Halloween week&amp;#8221; (yes, for real.) Here&amp;#8217;s a great Halloween costume and a great dance number featuring one guy as both Baby and Johnny. I&amp;#8217;m dying over here.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Damn Good Advice; A Soccer Lesson</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/damn-good-advice-a-soccer-lesson/"/>
   <updated>2012-07-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While watching soccer with my grandfather when I was a child, he would say to me, “The ball is round, anything could happen”. This advice has stuck with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally cannot apply this advice to the game of soccer, mostly because I’m not a soccer player, and I say this with confidence. During one of my first house league soccer games as a child, another boy ran up to me and kicked my in my shins. I fled the field crying and haven’t returned since. Though my chances of becoming a professional soccer player were slim to none, I had already started to pave my own path. One that involved a piece of paper and a pencil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I found that anything really could happen, and it was easy on the shins. As a child the possibilities for creating were limitless, there were no boundaries that needed to be broken, and any idea seemed to be a good one. I was reminded of the importance of having an open mind while flipping through the pages of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.presentationzen.com/&quot;&gt;“Presentation Zen”&lt;/a&gt; by Garr Reynolds,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A child does not know what is possible and so is open to exploration, discovery, and experimentation. If you approach creative tasks with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9389/9389&quot;&gt;beginners mind,&lt;/a&gt; you can see things more clearly as they are”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working at Hypenotic as an illustrator and designer for the past couple months has been a huge learning experience, and although a may not directly apply my grandfathers advice to the work that I do, it is always in the back of my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating an info-graphic or an illustration is all about finding a solution for a given problem. Many illustrators, including myself, can easily get stuck up on the first solution that comes into mind, and although you may hit the nail on the head the first time, 9 times out of 10 you won’t. Most of the time, nailing the solution means thinking of all the possibilities then weeding out the worst ones until your left with something that really works. I’ve learned that when you do finally come up the solution, no matter how much planning you do for a project, things are going to change somewhere along the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, anything is possible so explore those possibilities, and be prepared for anything to happen along the way, because it will.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Adobe Shadow: My New Friend</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/adobe-shadow-my-new-friend/"/>
   <updated>2012-07-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/adobe-shadow-my-new-friend</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve discovered a new web development friend which I&amp;#8217;d like you to meet. It has eased the pain of viewing and testing websites and apps on various devices. It&amp;#8217;s especially awesome for responsive web development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9629&quot; title=&quot;Adobe Shadow&quot; alt=&quot;Adobe Shadow&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/adobeshadow.jpg&quot; width=&quot;584&quot; height=&quot;296&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not one for touting a particular product, but when a small tool helps in a big way and fits in seamlessly with your work process it&amp;#8217;s worth sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ready&amp;#8230;it&amp;#8217;s name is &lt;a href=&quot;http://html.adobe.com/toolsandservices/shadow/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Adobe Shadow&lt;/a&gt; and I&amp;#8217;m a fan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#8217;t do a ton of things but what it does do is exactly what I need. Synchronized browsing, screenshots and remotely inspecting your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the scoop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Pair multiple Apple iOS and Google Android devices to your computer over a wireless connection. With Shadow, you can browse in Google Chrome and all connected devices will stay in sync.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Take screenshots of the current page from any connected device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Target a device for remote inspection, make changes to the HTML, CSS and JavaScript using familiar development tools, and see your device update in real time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one downside is that it only works with Google Chrome so cross browser testing isn&amp;#8217;t possible but I&amp;#8217;ve heard there is a bunch of stuff in the pipeline so you never know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s easy to setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Just download the Adobe Shadow app onto your device, in my case an iPhone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Install the Chrome Extension&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Install Adobe Shadow on your computer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing your pages with Shadow is a breeze. Just browse using Chrome and all devices that have been connected will follow along. This enables you to test the appearance and behavior of any page on a variety of devices at one time. Plus, Shadow will keep your device from going to sleep, so you no longer need to unlock the device when you want to test the page.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Tools of the Trade, and Evangelism</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/tools-of-the-trade-and-evangelism/"/>
   <updated>2012-07-25T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/tools-of-the-trade-and-evangelism</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-9593&quot; title=&quot;Code&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/preview.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;584&quot; height=&quot;233&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Internet has quickly become one of the most ideal platforms for entrepreneurs to grow ideas on, the engineering side has thrived with a plethora of technologies that allow us to create these dynamic, data-driven experiences. There is now an abundance of tools, frameworks and tutorials available to aid engineers and developers with getting these sites and apps up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all these new tools, comes fierce loyalty and dispute about which is better and why. In an ideal world, I think these tools were always meant to co-exist in harmony, allowing developers to choose a workflow that suits them, and helps them efficiently complete the tasks at hand. Many of these evangelists will berate other tech simply because it works better for them. The assumption that it works best for everyone is, at best, foolish. As a &lt;a href=&quot;http://php.net&quot; title=&quot;PHP&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;/a&gt; developer, I openly admit I’m not a fan of &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyonrails.org/&quot; title=&quot;Ruby on Rails&quot;&gt;Ruby/Rails&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.python.org/&quot; title=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;. The syntax structure just isn’t my cup of tea. However, there are piles of developers and engineers who love that type of syntax style and are very proficient at writing code with it. This doesn’t make one better than the other, it simply gives developers a choice to code to their tastes. Any site/app written in PHP can be written with Ruby or Python, and vice-versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As developers, we should be celebrating the choices we have to build the things we love. We should recognize and acknowledge the strengths and weaknesses of each tool, and ultimately choose the best one for the job.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Damn Good Advice; A History Lesson</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/damn-good-advice-a-history-lesson/"/>
   <updated>2012-07-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/damn-good-advice-a-history-lesson</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Summer is proving to be a bit of a challenge for Hypenotic&amp;#8217;s crack (or cracked?) team of bloggers. &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9487/what-a-lake-can-teach-you-about-life&quot;&gt;In a previous post&lt;/a&gt; I noted that when it comes to blog posts, &amp;#8220;focus breeds discipline.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end I&amp;#8217;m kicking off a series that Barry, Lionel, Rick, Chris, Collin &amp;amp; Amanda will run with in the following weeks (hear that gang?) It&amp;#8217;s called &amp;#8220;Damn Good Advice&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the idea; Somehow or other we&amp;#8217;ve all ended up at a values-based enterprise where doing good matters most. How did we get here? This series is intended to give a brief glimpse into the (morally superior) people we&amp;#8217;ve become. So, without further ado&amp;#8230;..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9573/damn-good-advice-a-history-lesson/attachment/damngoodadvice-2&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9603&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9603&quot; title=&quot;damngoodadvice&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/damngoodadvice1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;382&quot; height=&quot;201&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  It went down after a History 101 tutorial during my first year of undergrad.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cornered my T.A under the guise of asking some questions about the final exam, but what I was really after was someone to help me feel like I could deal with the end-of-semester pressure that was crushing me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years later I figured out I had an anxiety issue when the whole thing spun out of control.  But at that time it was just gut rot, pressure on my chest, and a general sense of impending doom that could only find relief in ceaseless work (punctuated by ceaseless smoking and bathing in heavy rotation.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversation with the young History 101 T.A turned from the assignment to the bigger picture. Passover was coming up, my family would be gathering for dinner and I was totally conflicted about whether I could make the trip from London, ON to Toronto for the weekend. All of this very important work was on my plate and if I didn&amp;#8217;t sit my ass down I would never get it done. Then I would fail and my life would basically suck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After patiently listening to my litany of concerns, the kind T.A leaned forward, looked me in the face and very simply said &amp;#8220;Jodi, go home.&amp;#8221; I&amp;#8217;m usually not much of a listener when I&amp;#8217;m in an anxious state. Let&amp;#8217;s say the voices in my head can be pretty loud. But this simple advice cut through everything and went straight to my bones. I immediately knew he was right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made the trip home. My 3 foot nothing Bubbie Rosie greeted me with a hug, and the greasy Passover food nourished my weary soul. I remembered I was a human being, not a fucking exam machine. It gave me what I needed to get through the semester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truth be told I&amp;#8217;m still working on putting this good advice into practice.  20 years later I&amp;#8217;m getting better at not &amp;#8220;forcing it.&amp;#8221; Last year I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/fun-stuff/6630/3-ways-to-avoid-doing-the-hustle&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;Not Doing the Hustle&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; or trying not to buy what Abe Lincoln said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Good things may come to those who wait. But only the things left by those who hustle.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a noble struggle and a life&amp;#8217;s work. In short, I&amp;#8217;m still trying to take his advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This graffiti image snapped on the streets of Cambridge (thanks Tonya Surman) pretty much sums it up.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Booze, Porn, Guns &#038; Payday Loans</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/booze-porn-guns-gmos-and-payday-loans/"/>
   <updated>2012-07-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/booze-porn-guns-gmos-and-payday-loans</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I was completing the most recent version of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bcorporation.net/become/BRS&quot;&gt;B Corp Assessmen&lt;/a&gt;t today, this set of questions caught my attention. Anything jump out at you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9552/booze-porn-guns-gmos-and-payday-loans/attachment/screen-shot-2012-07-16-at-12-51-47-pm-3&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9558&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-9558&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2012-07-16 at 12.51.47 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Screen-shot-2012-07-16-at-12.51.47-PM2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;604&quot; height=&quot;232&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it fascinating that Payday Loans are sandwiched between GMOs and porn on this list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure what they are? In short, payday loans are short term, unsecured loans that are to be paid on, you got it, payday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what makes them so bad?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set out on a journey to dig deeper. I admit, I&amp;#8217;ve been increasingly curious about payday loans as I&amp;#8217;ve watched them multiply like weeds in the downtown core. So, why is&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mrpayday.ca/&quot;&gt; Mr. Payday&lt;/a&gt; considered Mr. Monsanto&amp;#8217;s next door neighbour? Here&amp;#8217;s what you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Payday Loans?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Payday loans target the working poor whose needs are largely ignored by Canada&amp;#8217;s mainstream financial institutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  For those without credit payday loans may be the only safety net in times of financial need or crisis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Poor people are disproportionately subject to judgments and garnishments that make it preferable to operate in cash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Payday loan outlets tend to have convenient hours and super friendly service. And the whole transaction takes about 15 mins no questions asked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;So, What&amp;#8217;s the Problem?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  In Canada, the average payday loan has an interest rate of 350-600% APR (Annual Percentage Rate). By contrast, a gold Visa card has a 9.9% APR interest rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  According to a research report by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.responsiblelending.org/payday-lending/research-analysis/phantom-demand-short-term-due-date-generates-need-for-repeat-payday-loans-accounting-for-76-of-total-volume.html&quot;&gt;Centre for Responsible Lending&lt;/a&gt; (CRL) &amp;#8220;A full three quarters of loan volume of the payday lending industry is generated by borrowers who, after meeting the short-term due date of the loan, must re-borrow before their next pay period&amp;#8221; In other words, its not the first loan that&amp;#8217;s the problem, it&amp;#8217;s the loan on the loan on the loan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  This inability to pay is what&amp;#8217;s called a &amp;#8220;rollover.&amp;#8221; As CRL found rolling over loans accounts for 76 percent of total loan volume in Canada&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  A US &lt;a href=&quot;http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1120556&quot;&gt;study of payday loan customers&lt;/a&gt; found that &amp;#8220;about 20% had rolled over 9 or more advances.&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  In 29 of the 35 US states that permit this kind of lending, payday loan storefronts outnumber McDonalds&amp;#8217; restaurants (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/13/opinion/13mon3.html?_r=2&quot;&gt;NTY, 2009&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;So, What&amp;#8217;s the Solution?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Of course, ensuring a living wage for people is the best way to reduce the seduction of the payday loan. The Stop&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://putfoodinthebudget.ca/&quot;&gt;Put Food in the Budget &lt;/a&gt;shows how far Toronto&amp;#8217;s poor need to stretch their dollars just to manage their basic needs each month. And if an emergency comes up, you&amp;#8217;re shit out of luck.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Currently Canadian law doesn&amp;#8217;t allow for peer to peer lending like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prosper.com/&quot;&gt;Prosper&lt;/a&gt; in the US. Canada&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.communitylend.com/&quot;&gt;Community Lend&lt;/a&gt; (who we worked with when they were just starting out) is, as you can see &amp;#8220;no longer accepting applicants.&amp;#8221; That&amp;#8217;s because (and they put it nicely) &amp;#8220;P2P Lending, as it needs to operate within the Canadian regulatory system today, has enough headwinds blowing against it that getting to a significant scale was going to be both expensive and difficult.&amp;#8221; That&amp;#8217;s a shame
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Credit Unions in the US have offered lower interest alternatives to Payday Loans with much success. In Wisconsin, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prospera.ca/&quot;&gt;Prospera&lt;/a&gt; credit union has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goodmoneystore.com/&quot;&gt;GoodMoney&lt;/a&gt; loans, Based within Goodwill stores these loans charge half the interest of payday lenders.
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you&amp;#8217;re interested in knowing the lived experience of Payday loans, jere&amp;#8217;s a short video CRL put together to describe one US woman&amp;#8217;s experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just around the corner from WEFC&amp;#8217;s Food Hub, you can step right into the office of Hypenotic &amp;#8211; a marketing and design company with integrity and meaningful communications being at the core of their values&amp;#8230;and did we mention that they&amp;#8217;re foodies too?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We work with clients who are actively building the next economy, whether they’re entrepreneurs, non-profits or intra-preneurs,&amp;#8221; explains Principal Strategist Barry Martin.  &amp;#8220;Our roster of clients includes the likes of Fiesta Farms, The Gladstone Hotel, MaRS, Sustain Ontario and Canadian Immigrant. We are also a values based business, certified as a founding Canadian B Corp and working to spread the movement in Toronto and beyond.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypenotic realizes that this area of Parkdale is very much in need of the kind of fresh, healthy foods that West End Food Co-op&amp;#8217;s Food Hub will bring. &amp;#8220;Community groups have been pouring their hearts and souls into this community for decades,&amp;#8221; Hypenotic&amp;#8217;s General Manager Jodi Lastman states.  &amp;#8220;In speaking with community groups and municipal leaders, we’ve heard how a food co-op has long been part of Parkdale&amp;#8217;s collective dream for itself. The realization of this dream means so much to so many community groups up and down Queen Street and tucked into nooks in every corridor of this area.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you choose to become a bondholder, and invest in WEFC?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short answer? We think WEFC is a model of the kind of organization we need for a more sustainable, generative economy. We’re happy to support in many ways, but our bonds are an investment in the community we live and work in and a reminder that profit is a means, not an end in itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are you most excited about regarding WEFC?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re already involved with WEFC through the community cannery and the Sorauren market. Now we&amp;#8217;re excited about seeing the food hub open its doors. It&amp;#8217;ll be a real treat to pick up lunch for the office or for a meeting, or pick up some staples for dinner time and know we&amp;#8217;re supporting a venture that resonates with us on a deeper level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why should others invest with WEFC?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  WEFC is a living symbol of a business that serves its owners and community first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  WEFC is an enterprise that blends good food with a commitment to food security and public health. That means recognizing that good food is essential–for everyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Supporting WEFC is vote for stewards who bring a conscious, inclusive and long term perspective to development in Parkdale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We challenge all of the businesses up and down Queen Street to invest in a place that will be a critical hub in our community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About the Food Hub being on the verge of opening, Barry comments: &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s a sign that Parkdale development can continue moving in the right direction–and we’re not talking about condos here.  Also, selfishly, we&amp;#8217;re just really looking forward to grabbing some awesome lunches right around the corner and knowing our money is part of something that serves local producers, our neighbours and our values.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;West End Food Co-op is proud to have such strong support from the team at Hypenotic.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Blue-Green Algae Blooms at Caribou Lake</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/blue-green-algae-blooms-at-caribou-lake/"/>
   <updated>2012-07-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/blue-green-algae-blooms-at-caribou-lake</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9497/blue-green-algae-blooms-at-caribou-lake/attachment/cariboulake-2&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9537&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9537&quot; title=&quot;cariboulake&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/cariboulake1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;229&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caribou Lake, near Sault St. Marie in Algoma has a blue-green menace in its midst. Blooming blue green algae has kept people from swimming, fishing and using water from their wells since 2010. It&amp;#8217;s a total bummer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The algae blooms were partly caused by farmers, citizens and cottagers whose habits have caused &amp;#8220;nutrient loading,&amp;#8221; or an overload of phosphorous and nitrogen in the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to keep blue-green algae out of your lake? Here&amp;#8217;s information outlining what you need to know;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Don&amp;#8217;t use conventional, chemical loaded lawn and garden fertilizers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Keep your shoreline green&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Don&amp;#8217;t let conventional soaps and shampoos get into the lake during bathing, dishwashing, laundry, and cleaning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Inspect your septic tanks, outhouses etc. to make sure they are working properly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Work for your clients, not your heroes.</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/work-for-your-clients-not-your-heros/"/>
   <updated>2012-07-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/work-for-your-clients-not-your-heros</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it can be just as important to know who your audience ISN&amp;#8217;T, as knowing who it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve had two conversations with people this week that reminded me how much energy people waste worrying about the wrong audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One alluded to the need to avoid any visual reference to their field (photography) because it would be too challenging to use it in a way that their peers wouldn&amp;#8217;t find cheesy. I get that sentiment–Hypenotic wouldn&amp;#8217;t use computers in our identity materials either. The notable part is that he was concerned about looking amateurish to his peers. I explained that photographers don&amp;#8217;t hire him. They don&amp;#8217;t particularly recommend him. And if they did, it would be because of his studio&amp;#8217;s unique offering, remarkable facility and his reputation, not because of some art on their web page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other conversation was with a painter building a site for her work. As usual, I tried to find the hook–why should anyone spend more than 2 seconds on her site? What traction could she offer that would help people stick around longer than they needed to understand that she was a painter and to glance at the aesthetic? How might a vistor identify with her, or remember her, or discuss her?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The convention in the art space is to draw from galleries–as white as possible so the work stands out. But a website isn&amp;#8217;t a gallery. You can&amp;#8217;t control the clutter on the reader&amp;#8217;s desk or desktop, the resolution of their monitor, whether the sunlight is bouncing off their laptop or monitor, or if their kids are screaming at them while they&amp;#8217;re trying to look at the work. etc. It seems to me that if you&amp;#8217;d like your work to stick out, the least you might try is differentiating from every other artist&amp;#8217;s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand where these sentiments come from. I have them too. I design and critique our work with a jury of my heroes standing over it. Which is of course silly. It&amp;#8217;s great to be detail oriented and true to your vision, but if there&amp;#8217;s one audience you really want to make an impression on, shouldn&amp;#8217;t it be the people who might actually buy your product?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My clients aren&amp;#8217;t Stephen Sagmeister, Milton Glaser, Saul Bass, Jeffrey Zeldman, Jason Santamaria or Seth Godin (who it happens, did indeed once give us a glowing review, but that&amp;#8217;s another story). They&amp;#8217;re people with expertise in completely different verticals than mine. They may or may not have years of experience assessing design deliverables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you dismiss the argument by telling yourself you&amp;#8217;re addressing both audiences, I&amp;#8217;d suggest you spend a few minutes honestly considering what your clients have in common with your heroes. Word view? Experience? Training?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could be wasting time and energy while overlooking opportunities to differentiate from your peers who haven&amp;#8217;t read this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>5 Things I&#8217;ve Learned From Lakes</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/what-a-lake-can-teach-you-about-life/"/>
   <updated>2012-07-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/what-a-lake-can-teach-you-about-life</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9487/what-a-lake-can-teach-you-about-life/attachment/screen-shot-2012-07-10-at-3-02-22-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9491&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-9491&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2012-07-10 at 3.02.22 PM&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Screen-shot-2012-07-10-at-3.02.22-PM.png&quot; width=&quot;504&quot; height=&quot;498&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
                                          &lt;em&gt;My daughters and I at 2nd Depot Lake last weekend&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  We&amp;#8217;re 32 weeks into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/browsing/ontario-lakes-project&quot;&gt;Ontario Lakes Project&lt;/a&gt; and we&amp;#8217;ve only just launched into the letter &amp;#8216;C&amp;#8217; (which used to be for Cookie, but last week was for &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/fun-stuff/9466/9466&quot;&gt;Canoe lake&lt;/a&gt;). We still have a long way to go.  as we work our way through the entire alphabetical list of Wikipedia &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lakes_of_Ontario&quot;&gt;List of Lakes of Ontario&lt;/a&gt;,  we thought it was worth talking a pause and reflecting on the  valuable lessons we&amp;#8217;ve learned so far:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Focus Breeds Discipline: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;****All of us at Hypenotic are supposed to be blogging on a regular basis, but in the midst of pressing client timelines blogging often falls by the wayside. I&amp;#8217;m sure you know the feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the exception of very few weeks, we&amp;#8217;ve kept this Ontario Lakes Project thing up. Why? Because we made a commitment to a focused idea. Every week I go to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lakes_of_Ontario&quot;&gt;List of Lakes&lt;/a&gt;, see which one&amp;#8217;s next and dig into my research. As a result, much of the initial thinking/wondering &amp;#8220;what should I write about?&amp;#8221; is out of the equation. What&amp;#8217;s the take away? That we&amp;#8217;d all be better off if we planned out blog topics in advance. It&amp;#8217;s a big challenge but tools like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.divvyhq.com/&quot;&gt;Divvy&lt;/a&gt; exist for the sole purpose of taking the guesswork out of blogging. I can attest that this approach works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Collaboration is Awesome:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the Ontario Lakes is a collaborative effort between myself and one of our talented graphic designers (to date Chris and Angelica have run the show). I write the content and without any direction, one of them designs what strikes them as the most intriguing or interesting aspect of that lake&amp;#8217;s story. Sometimes it&amp;#8217;s just as I imagined (&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9267/crappie-fishing-at-brampton-lake&quot;&gt;Crappie Fishing at Cameron Lake&lt;/a&gt; pretty much drew itself) and sometimes I&amp;#8217;m entirely surprised (The Mink Milk one for &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/ontario-lakes-project/8871/ontario-lakes-project-birch-lake&quot;&gt;Birch Lake&lt;/a&gt; wasn&amp;#8217;t what I was expecting). But this cool collaboration keeps it interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Be Willing to Change Course&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look back at &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/6998/water-week-1-lake-abitibi&quot;&gt;Lake Abitibi&lt;/a&gt;, the first lake we featured, it was pretty straight-ahead in terms of focus. A little about the lake&amp;#8217;s name but nothing too snazzy. We figured out that we&amp;#8217;d all get bored fast if we didn&amp;#8217;t find a way to find more interesting content. By &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/7291/the-ontario-lakes-project-ahmic-lake&quot;&gt;Lake Ahmic we hit on a bit about swimmer Marty Sinn&lt;/a&gt; and we were hooked on a whole new way of approaching content. Pardon the pun, but we decided to &amp;#8220;look for the hook.&amp;#8221; Each lake needed an interesting narrative, and our job was to find it. We&amp;#8217;ve been doing that ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Be Relentless and Curious&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No offense, but some Lakes don&amp;#8217;t offer much in the content department. I am forever grateful to &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/ontario-lakes-project/9438/canonto-lifted-condensation-the-blended-life-of-phil-the-forecaster&quot;&gt;Phil the Forecaster&lt;/a&gt; for painting Canonto Lake, otherwise I would have skipped it all together and hope no one noticed. Here are a few tricks for unburying hidden content:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Add the word &amp;#8220;famous&amp;#8221; before a term you&amp;#8217;re googling&amp;#8211;that&amp;#8217;s how I found the one about &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/7918/ontario-lakes-project-lake-baptiste-lets-crash-the-party-ill-crash-the-plane&quot;&gt;Lake Baptiste&lt;/a&gt;.  Also, words like &amp;#8220;weird,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;news&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;funny&amp;#8221; used in conjunction with your search term yields interesting results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Check out what&amp;#8217;s on&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com&quot;&gt; YouTube&lt;/a&gt; (the world&amp;#8217;s second largest search engine), and don&amp;#8217;t forget &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vimeo.com&quot;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt; (if youtube is about quantity, then Vimeo is about quality).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Get Local. Local papers are great for providing on the ground insight. After all, a Cottage Associations have their ear to the ground.  There&amp;#8217;s no better place to find knowledge than within a group of people so invested in a place , issue or idea they&amp;#8217;re willing to write about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;5. When lakes give you lemons, make Lakeaid&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/ontario-lakes-project/8756/contest-winner-big-yirkie-lake-ontario-lakes-project&quot;&gt;Big Yirkie Lake&lt;/a&gt; had us stumped. There seemed to be nothing interesting about that particular body of water. So, we put out a call to our community, asking them to come up with something (anything) interesting about Big Yirkie, and the contest winner, David Kruger, got a case of beer for his trouble. We in turn got an idea for a logo that rocked it.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  Stay tuned for more lakes, and if you have one that you&amp;#8217;re particularly passionate about tell us and we&amp;#8217;ll let you guide the process.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  Happy swimming!
&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>Tom Thomson and the Mystery of Canoe Lake: Ontario Lakes Project</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/9466/"/>
   <updated>2012-07-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/9466</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9466/9466/attachment/canoe&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9483&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9483&quot; title=&quot;canoe&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/canoe.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;357&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canadian painter Tom Thomson was last seen alive on July 8th, 1917. That means the anniversary of his last sighting is this Sunday. He was found dead a week later in Canoe Lake, which is the next lake on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lakes_of_Ontario&quot;&gt;Wikipedia List of Lakes of Ontario&lt;/a&gt; we&amp;#8217;re using to guide the &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/browsing/ontario-lakes-project&quot;&gt;Ontario Lakes Project.&lt;/a&gt; Is this coincidence or conspiracy? If it was a conspiracy, it wouldn&amp;#8217;t be the first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomson was very familiar with Canoe Lake since he&amp;#8217;d been a guide, a fire ranger and a visitor to the lake numerous times over the course of his life. When he was found on the lakes&amp;#8217; shores he had a bruise on this left temple, and one of his legs was wrapped with fishing twine. Was his death the result of an accident? foul play? murder? suicide? The mystery has yet to be resolved, though &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/a-break-in-the-mysterious-case-of-tom-thomson-canadas-van-gogh/article1214427/?page=all&quot;&gt;many have made it their business to uncover Thompson&amp;#8217;s true cause of death.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new fim entitled &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whitepinepictures.com/all-titles/west-wind-the-vision-of-tom-thomson/&quot;&gt;West Wind: The Vision of Tom Thomson &lt;/a&gt;explores the life––and not the death of Thomson. As a Globe review said&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mysterious death can do wonders for an artistic career. The attention paid to Tom Thomson’s 1917 death at age 39 on Algonquin Park’s Canoe Lake has often overshadowed the Canadian painter’s extraordinary body of work&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of Thomson&amp;#8217;s life, we&amp;#8217;re featuring one of his famous paintings of the lake he knew, and loved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9466/9466/attachment/jack_pine&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9484&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-9484&quot; title=&quot;jack_pine&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/jack_pine-580x525.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;525&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>More than Rock &#038; Roll</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/more-than-rock-roll/"/>
   <updated>2012-06-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/more-than-rock-roll</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9455/more-than-rock-roll/attachment/the-wall&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9456&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9456&quot; title=&quot;The-wall&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/The-wall.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;437&quot; height=&quot;267&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pink Floyd’s The Wall is one of the most iconic and influential albums in the history of Rock &amp;amp; Roll. It was written by a very tormented Roger Waters back in 1979 as a a semi autobiographical piece that talks about the loss of his father, failed relationships and dealing with fame, addiction, pain and isolation. However this very intimate story has changed its meaning as The Wall becomes a metaphor of human separation; rich from poor, east from west, capitalism from communism, war from peace, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday, July 23 of 2012, I had the privilege of watching The Wall live in Toronto and it was impressive to realize that this show is as relevant today as it ever was. Maybe that’s the reason why Roger Waters is dedicating 2 years to tour the world giving 192 performances of one of the most ambitious and sophisticated shows ever imagined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wanted to make much broader political and humanitarian statements without being preachy in a way that is beautiful rather than ugly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stage features a 120 ft. physical wall that is being built before the audience’s eyes while the band is playing. The wall becomes a canvas to an overflow of graphics that synchronize with the music resulting in overwhelming emotion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a very strong anti-war, anti-capitalism message that is ubiquitous during the show, one of the highlights happening during the song “Goodbye Blue Sky” while an animation of B52’s drops Shell logos and Dollar signs instead of bombs. The song “Mother” becomes a criticism to the government where the main character is a security camera, always watching and “protecting” us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This goes beyond rock and roll, this is meant to encourage us to empathizing with others.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t had the chance to watch the show yet, I would strongly encourage you to check out the finale of the tour on July 21 in Quebec City which will include a bigger-than-ever wall of over 250 metres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you are not convinced yet, just watch this video:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you experienced the show, what did you think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This painting of Lake Canonto entitled &amp;#8220;Canonto Lifted Condensati&lt;wbr&gt;on Level&amp;#8221; was created by an artist who goes by the moniker &lt;a href=&quot;http://philtheforecaster.blogspot.ca/&quot;&gt;Phil the Forecaster. &lt;/a&gt;Trained at Queen&amp;#8217;s University as a nuclear physicist, &amp;#8220;Phil the Forecaster&amp;#8221; has been a professional meteorologist since 1976. That would explain why he paints clouds so well.&lt;/wbr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/ontario-lakes-project/9438/canonto-lifted-condensation-the-blended-life-of-phil-the-forecaster/attachment/screen-shot-2012-06-28-at-1-40-31-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9439&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9439&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2012-06-28 at 1.40.31 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-shot-2012-06-28-at-1.40.31-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;449.591&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve often come across people who have two distinct passions, but few seem to be able to have their passions coexist as harmoniously as Phil the Forecaster, who blends meteorology and painting with such lovely results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out Phil the Forecaster&amp;#8217;s blog post and painting &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.philtheforecaster.blogspot.ca/2012/06/summer-clouds.html&quot;&gt;Summer Clouds &lt;/a&gt;which reads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cumulus clouds were developing early under the strong, late spring sun. It had rained hard overnight and there was moisture everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could all aspire to bring our passions together as well as Phil the Forecaster, who brought poetry to the Condensation that was hanging around Lake Canonto.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Parkdale&#8217;s Biggest Employer</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/parkdales-biggest-employer/"/>
   <updated>2012-06-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/parkdales-biggest-employer</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Who is Parkdale&amp;#8217;s biggest employer? A hot startup web company? A state of the art recording studio? An industrial design firm? You might be surprised to find out that &lt;a href=&quot;http://parc.on.ca/&quot;&gt;PARC&lt;/a&gt; (Parkdale Activity Recreation Centre) located at the foot of Queen West and Dowling is likely Parkdale&amp;#8217;s biggest employer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARC is among a strip of social service organizations just before you embark on the Queensway. You know the one right?  Well, as part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9302/where-we-draw-the-line&quot;&gt;Hypenotic&amp;#8217;s journey to better connect and serve our Parkdale community&lt;/a&gt; I walked through the doors I&amp;#8217;d passed by many times and was introduced to a place that still has me reeling with excitement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9434/parkdales-biggest-employer/attachment/screen-shot-2012-06-27-at-10-00-46-am&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9435&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9435&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2012-06-27 at 10.00.46 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-shot-2012-06-27-at-10.00.46-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;398&quot; height=&quot;294&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside PARC&amp;#8217;s doors I found a number of folks facing issues of  poverty, mental health, addictions, homelessness and food security issues all working to rebuild their lives. But I also found Parkdale&amp;#8217;s biggest employer. Consider the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  120: The number of PARC members (their clients) who also work running the daily operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  39: The number of people employed by PARC&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://edmondplace.ca/&quot;&gt;Edmund Place&lt;/a&gt;, a supportive housing complex. This number includes all the 34 tenants, plus 3 housekeeping member employees, 2 tenant/cooks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These numbers don&amp;#8217;t include folks working at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.silverbrush.ca/&quot;&gt;The Silver Brush&lt;/a&gt; a social enterprise PARC started which employs PARC members to undertake interior painting services in the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  In addition to its role as an employer, PARC is also one of Parkdale&amp;#8217;s biggest, and best landlords. As Parkdale&amp;#8217;s gentrification takes hold and more and more restaurants and local businesses change the face of Queen West, rents have skyrocketed. When PARC&amp;#8217;s renovation was completed, they had the opportunity to seek out desirable tenants for desirable storefront real estate.Did they get Second Cup? Sleep Country? Rexall? Nope.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
   
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  Parc became a landlord, offering reasonable rent options to other non-profits serving the community including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stchrishouse.org/st-chris/index.php&quot;&gt;St. Chistopher House&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crct.org/&quot;&gt;Community Resource Connections&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://creatingtogetherparkdalefrp.com/&quot;&gt;Creating Together Family Resource Centre &lt;/a&gt;all on street level.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
   
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  My visit to PARC highlighted the degree to which PARC plays a critical part in building the generative economy. In a recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/9-strategies-to-end-corporate-rule/can-there-be-201cgood201d-corporations&quot;&gt;YES Magazine&lt;/a&gt; article on the subject, Marjorie Kelly (who we met at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livingeconomies.org/conference-2012/&quot;&gt;BALLE Conference&lt;/a&gt;) puts it this way:
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  This revolution is about broadening economic power from the few to the many and redefining the purpose of economic activity. The aim isn’t to endlessly grow gross domestic product or to create wealth for a financial elite, but to generate the conditions for the flourishing of life.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  PARC is playing a critical role in building a new economy where wealth is shared, so much so that when Mike Harris cut taxes to wealthier folks on the backs of the poorest among us, PARC&amp;#8217;s staff donated their tax cuts back to PARC, creating a fund that still exists today.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
   
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  We&amp;#8217;re getting to know our neighbours better. And as we walk down Queen Street we&amp;#8217;re learning that the new economy isn&amp;#8217;t that new after all. It&amp;#8217;s been alive and well in Parkdale for a long time thanks to organizations like PARC.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
   
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Giddyup with Github: Hypenotic&#8217;s Development Process</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/giddyup-with-github-our-development-process/"/>
   <updated>2012-06-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/giddyup-with-github-our-development-process</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;June has been an amazing month for change within the creative walls of Hypenotic. A new baby was born, meditation has created an almost zen like focus in the office and Hypenotic has set off on some new sustainable directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, we&amp;#8217;ve got one more. We&amp;#8217;ve completely revamped our online development process. We&amp;#8217;re now (finally) using Git to properly version and deploy web projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://git-scm.com/about/free-and-open-source&quot;&gt;free and open source&lt;/a&gt; distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that for our developers, we can now offer peace of mind. We can have multiple developers working simultaneously on the same project without fear that someone will override or even delete someone else&amp;#8217;s code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our clients, we can now offer a full development history, a proper staging site where new functionality or enhancements can be tested before deploying to the live site and an easy rollback process if something doesn&amp;#8217;t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Hypenotic, it means sanity and a clear, consistent process regardless of how small or large the project. It&amp;#8217;s a process that allows any developer (freelance, intern or new hire) to come in and know exactly what was done,  the current status of the project and the ability to get up and running quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_9419&quot; style=&quot;width: 590px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/developmentprocess.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9419&quot; title=&quot;Hypenotic&#39;s development process&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/developmentprocess.jpg&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;351&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    Hypenotic&amp;#8217;s development process
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development process goes like this. We have a Github repository that has 3 branches: &lt;strong&gt;master&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;staging&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;production&lt;/strong&gt;. The master branch is the centre piece. From it, we can create other temporary branches for specific new features or bug fixes. We then merge those branches back into the master. When we feel we&amp;#8217;re ready, we merge the master branch into the staging branch which gets deployed to our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linode.com&quot;&gt;Linode&lt;/a&gt; server for testing. Once we have the thumbs up, we can then merge the staging into to the production branch which then can be deployed to wherever it needs to be.  Nice and easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s it. If you have any questions about the process just &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/contact&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#8217;d like to thank &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/#!/minusfive&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jorge&lt;/a&gt; for the awesome insight, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/#!/syropian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Collin&lt;/a&gt; for digging in and getting this working and &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/fun-stuff/9182/new-kid-on-the-block&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt; for the snazzy illustration of the process.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Beginner&#8217;s Mind for Business</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/9389/"/>
   <updated>2012-06-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/9389</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;In the beginner&amp;#8217;s mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert&amp;#8217;s there are few.&amp;#8221;&lt;br&gt;
Zen Master Shunryo Suzuki&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9389/9389/attachment/screen-shot-2012-06-21-at-12-07-40-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9394&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9394&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2012-06-21 at 12.07.40 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-shot-2012-06-21-at-12.07.40-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;297&quot; height=&quot;296&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently finished a course in&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.themindfulnessclinic.ca/&quot;&gt; Mindfulness Meditation for Stress Reduction&lt;/a&gt;. Most people I meet think they could never meditate because they think they&amp;#8217;d have  to sit cross legged and try to have as a &amp;#8220;clear mind.&amp;#8221;  If that was the case, I assure you, I have been expelled from the class by the end of the first day.  Instead, the point of Mindfulness Mediation is sit and to watch where your mind goes, label the thoughts (&amp;#8220;Oh, now I&amp;#8217;m planning&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;That&amp;#8217;s my worrying mind&amp;#8221;) and gently turn your mind back to paying attention to your breath. It&amp;#8217;s not considered &amp;#8220;bad&amp;#8221; to have distracting thoughts. In fact, the more time you can repeat the pattern of thought/label/return, the more you&amp;#8217;ll build your mindfulness muscle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things the course taught me is the value of the &amp;#8220;beginner&amp;#8217;s mind.&amp;#8221; The beginner&amp;#8217;s mind is why I was able to take up running. Instead of being consumed by the usual story the voices in my head that tell me (&amp;#8220;you&amp;#8217;re to fat to run&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;you&amp;#8217;re no runner&amp;#8221;), I just lace up and run (but seriously, do I have to run in this heat?&amp;#8230;.return to breath&amp;#8230;). The simple definition of Beginner&amp;#8217;s Mind from&lt;a href=&quot;http://mindfulnessclasses.com/beginnersmind.htm&quot;&gt; this site &lt;/a&gt;is quite useful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take all of the things you know&amp;#8211;all of your brilliant opinions, all of your reason and logic, even your cherished beliefs&amp;#8211;and you put all this stuff on the shelf for awhile&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve found this approach to be incredibly helpful in my work at Hypenotic. Of course Barry and I still have our battles and I can get pretty tense (I&amp;#8217;m just saying this to preempt our coworkers from calling me out). No one is perfect and I don&amp;#8217;t fart rainbows, but I&amp;#8217;ve definitely benefitted from Mindfulness training and the Beginner&amp;#8217;s Mind. Here&amp;#8217;s a few ways in which I&amp;#8217;ve seen a difference:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;A Beginner&amp;#8217;s Mind is Your Best Brainstorming Friend:&lt;/strong&gt;  When trying to come up with creative ideas it&amp;#8217;s easy to get bogged down with practical issues, or all the reasons why the idea wouldn&amp;#8217;t/couldn&amp;#8217;t/shouldn&amp;#8217;t work. The Beginner&amp;#8217;s Mind lets me keep those at bay so I can stay creative. This frame of mind also helps keep me at arm&amp;#8217;s length from what&amp;#8217;s existed before or my first good idea that I can&amp;#8217;t seem to get away from. Steve Jobs put it best. In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.02/jobs_pr.html&quot;&gt;Wired interview&lt;/a&gt; he said when speaking about the value of the Beginner&amp;#8217;s Mind in building technology: &amp;#8220;There&amp;#8217;s a tremendous open possibility to the whole thing. And it hasn&amp;#8217;t been confined, or defined, in too many ways.&amp;#8221; Imagine you could approach brainstorm sessions with that thinking. Creativity overdrive!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; *&lt;em&gt;The Beginner&amp;#8217;s Mind puts the Relations in &amp;#8220;Client Relations:&amp;#8221; *&lt;/em&gt;Sorry folks, client relationships can be stressful. The wants and needs of clients can put alot of pressure on us communications folks who are doing our best to deliver on time, on budget, etc. Like a marriage, these relationships can fall under the spell of predictable patterns where you think you know what the person&amp;#8217;s going to say even before they&amp;#8217;ve said it. This is not a good for any relationship. The Beginner&amp;#8217;s Mind helps me approach each new client interaction with fresh eyes and that allows me hear what they&amp;#8217;re saying and not react to &amp;#8220;old tapes&amp;#8221; or the noise in my head.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The Beginner&amp;#8217;s Mind is Good for Business: &lt;/strong&gt;In case you haven&amp;#8217;t noticed, the motley crew at Hypenotic has come up with some pretty interesting ideas about how to run a business (need a refresher? &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9302/where-we-draw-the-line&quot;&gt;read this&lt;/a&gt;) I&amp;#8217;m not predisposed to risk. In fact, I&amp;#8217;m pretty risk adverse. But, the Beginner&amp;#8217;s Mind has given me faith that anything&amp;#8217;s possible. I approach new ideas with the curiosity to explore. If my heart says its a good idea then I&amp;#8217;m willing to go with my heart until proven otherwise. It&amp;#8217;s a very liberating feeling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  If you&amp;#8217;re interested in this Mindfulness stuff and want to explore some writings about the Beginner&amp;#8217;s Mind, here&amp;#8217;s a few I can recommend:
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Jon Kabat Zinn&amp;#8217;s book &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Mindfulness-Beginners-Reclaiming-Present-Moment--/dp/1604076585/ref=la_B000AQ12GA_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1340306641&amp;sr=1-2&quot;&gt;Mindfulness for Beginners&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Fast Company article &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/1692662/will-beginners-mind-save-sophisticated-corporations&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;Will the Beginner&amp;#8217;s Mind Save Sophisticated Corporations?&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Zen Habits &lt;a href=&quot;http://zenhabits.net/how-to-live-life-to-the-max-with-beginners-mind/&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;Live Life to the Max with Beginner&amp;#8217;s Mind.&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  
  &lt;div&gt;
    Now you&amp;#8217;ll have to excuse me, I need to go for a run&amp;#8230;.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>Anticipating a View of An Open Pit: Cameron Lake</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/9378/"/>
   <updated>2012-06-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/9378</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/ontario-lakes-project/9378/9378/attachment/cameon-lake&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9414&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-9414&quot; title=&quot;Cameron Lake, Ontario&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/cameon-lake-580x352.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;352&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently there&amp;#8217;s gold in them there waters. Cameron Lake in the Kawartha region is in the midst of an environmental assessment, which could result in open pit development in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a photo of a similar mine happening close by in the Kawartha region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/ontario-lakes-project/9378/9378/attachment/screen-shot-2012-06-21-at-10-42-46-am&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9379&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9379&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2012-06-21 at 10.42.46 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-shot-2012-06-21-at-10.42.46-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;345&quot; height=&quot;223&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in contrast, here&amp;#8217;s a photo taken on the shores of Cameron Lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now tell me, which view do you prefer?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, we&amp;#8217;ve come to see our mission as helping to manifest a more sustainable economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sustainable economy is one that gives back. Continuously. A golden Goose as it were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve been working on it chiefly in a few ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Choosing to work with values driven brands, non-profits and intra-preneurs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Insisting on making meaningful marketing, instead of push/land-fill marketing no one needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Getting BCorp Certification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Helping BCorp spread in our region&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Having progressive policies (like paying 40% of people&amp;#8217;s exercise dues)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Convening and connecting smart, interested people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Donating personal time to boards and committees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Sharing useful info through our site and social networks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been a great approach. Beyond helping us sleep better at night AND being excited to come to work in the AM, most of the people drawn to working with us and for us are pre-qualified fits. In the last year we&amp;#8217;ve launched projects for dynamic organizations like Local Food Plus, Canadian Immigrant and MaRS (all our clients are awesome so if you didn&amp;#8217;t get mentioned it just means I&amp;#8217;m trying to keep this brief).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that changed a couple of weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9302/where-we-draw-the-line/attachment/screen-shot-2012-06-16-at-june-16-1-43am&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9363&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-9363&quot; title=&quot;Gearing up for Balle2012&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-shot-2012-06-16-at-June-16-1.43AM-580x415.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;415&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Jodi and I attended the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livingeconomies.org/&quot; title=&quot;BALLE network link&quot;&gt;BALLE&lt;/a&gt; (Business Alliance for Local Living Economies) Conference in Grand Rapids Michigan and we left with a new sense of purpose. We learned about Generative Economies from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tellus.org/about/Kelly.html&quot;&gt;Marjorie Kelly&lt;/a&gt;. Generative economies are a significantly extended version of my idea of sustainable economies. They aren&amp;#8217;t merely self perpetuating, they create more opportunites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learned about the value of local ownership and what happens when community members collaborate on defining and serving a vision for their workplace, neighbourhood or city. Let&amp;#8217;s unpack that for a sec.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When business owners live where their ventures are located, they often have a different interest in the community. And there are many forms of ownership–people can be invested in an idea or process as well as an enterprise. But when owners live near their enterprise, money circulates in the local economy a lot longer, creating more value at each turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#8217;s this notion of collaboration. Imagine what would happen if BIAs, neighbourhood associations, folks looking for work, non-profits, poor people, wealthy people and municipal leaders got together to map out their challenges and dreams. I can tell you that from what I saw in Grand Rapids Michigan a few weeks ago, it looks good. Gorgeous real estate is affordable. Corporations like Cascade Engineering take on challenges like &lt;a title=&quot;Cascade Engineering Racism Statement&quot; href=&quot;http://www.cascadeng.com/about/antiracism.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;racism&lt;/a&gt;. I met a computer programmer who was starting a business with a government grant matching his seed capital. The place wasn&amp;#8217;t perfect, but it felt like it was headed in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next is the &amp;#8220;service&amp;#8221; notion. That a business, region or given opportunity doesn&amp;#8217;t exist to be exploited but to be served. My role is to serve not only my clients, but my employees and broader community. Heady stuff. But tangible too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We both felt like we left with clear ideas about how to be a better purpose driven business. We&amp;#8217;re investigating ownership models for our team members, have started to reach out to community organizations we didn&amp;#8217;t know yet and have started meeting with the rest of the Toronto based BALLE attendees to discuss how we can use what we&amp;#8217;ve learned to foster ownership on the city level. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s worth noting that I heard no end of amazing stories of people who have figured out how to turn the way they make a living into a way to build opportunity and community. I now see a picture forming of an alternative to the gloomy financial meltdowns on the news daily. I see people taking and creating ownership and I think it couldn&amp;#8217;t be a more exciting time to be in business.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Walmart Effect; Or How My Crappy T-Shirt Taught Me Not to Care About The Economy</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/9333/"/>
   <updated>2012-06-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/9333</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9333/9333/attachment/screen-shot-2012-06-07-at-june-7-11-25pm-2&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9337&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9337&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2012-06-07 at [June 7] 11.25PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-shot-2012-06-07-at-June-7-11.25PM1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;594&quot; height=&quot;444&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How long do you expect a pair of jeans to last? How about a t-shirt? A pair of shoes? In the Grist article &lt;a href=&quot;http://grist.org/business-technology/2011-11-11-is-your-stuff-falling-apart-thank-walmart/&quot;&gt;Is Your Stuff Falling Apart, Blame Walmart&lt;/a&gt; the writer shares valuable insight about how Walmart has driven down the market for quality goods&amp;#8211;and not just because they&amp;#8217;re cheaper:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using its market power to drive down the quality of manufacturing, Walmart gains an advantage over department stores and independent retailers because quality (and the knowledgeable service that typically goes with it) is no longer an important factor in a consumer’s choice about where to shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walmart has changed consumer habits. We no longer think that a quality shirt that will last exists in any store&amp;#8211;even an independently owned one with top-notch service. So, we figure we may as well buy a cheap one at a store that doesn&amp;#8217;t offer any service whatsoever. And, as the writer points out, this becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy: &amp;#8220;As local stores and other competing retailers are weakened, manufacturers become more dependent on Walmart.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lowering of standards is a powerful thing. It&amp;#8217;s easy to underestimate what it means that we no longer expect more than we&amp;#8217;re given. I&amp;#8217;m currently reading Jim Stanford&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economicsforeveryone.ca/&quot;&gt;Economics for Everyone &lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8211;a great book if, like me, you feel like Economics is a bit too mystifying to engage in. Stanford identifies that one of the key tenets of neoliberalism (the belief that governments should not play a significant role in regulating the economy), which we&amp;#8217;re living with today&amp;#8211;both on a City and on a Federal Level, is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ratcheting down of popular expectations. There has been a deliberate and multidimensional effort since the early 1980&amp;#8242;s to construct a whole new cultural mindset, in which people stop demanding much from the economy,and accept insecurity and vulnerability as permanent &amp;#8220;natural&amp;#8221; features of life.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sound familiar? Just like the tiny holes in your cheap t-shirt that appear after only a month of occasional wear, neoliberalism is about the fundamental lowering of expectations. Garbage becomes privatized. They start charging user fees to swim at the community center pool. Migrant workers wages are cut. You think to complain, but to whom? We&amp;#8217;re living in the age of the &amp;#8220;broken window.&amp;#8221; The broken window theory of criminality basically posits that when people feel the world around them is in disrepair they are more prone to commit criminal acts. When we have holes in our clothes, and everything&amp;#8217;s poorly made we are primed to expect less&amp;#8211;of our government, of our economy, of ourselves and of eachother. Or maybe it&amp;#8217;s the other way around. Or perhaps more likely, a bit of everything thrown together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t believe me? If you can afford it, go buy one nice, good quality, locally manufactured pair of jeans and consider how wearing them alters your perspective on the world. Be sure to report back.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why Cadbury&#8217;s Bicycle Factory Is a Few Spokes Shy of a Wheel</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/why-cadburys-bicycle-factory-is-a-few-spokes-shy-of-a-wheel/"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9305/why-cadburys-bicycle-factory-is-a-few-spokes-shy-of-a-wheel/attachment/screen-shot-2012-05-30-at-3-59-42-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9306&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-9306&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2012-05-30 at 3.59.42 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-shot-2012-05-30-at-3.59.42-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;449&quot; height=&quot;241&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon Cadbury&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thebicyclefactory.ca/&quot;&gt;Bicycle Factory&lt;/a&gt; site when I noticed a couple of friends (who I like and trust) had &amp;#8216;liked&amp;#8217; it on Facebook. Cadbury has been on the do-good bandwagon since 2009 when  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/food-and-wine/cadbury-dips-into-fair-trade-market/article1264256/&quot;&gt;they proclaimed themselves &lt;/a&gt;the world&amp;#8217;s largest candy company to sell Fair Trade chocolate. This is the same year that the Bicycle Factory project began. The Bicycle Factory experience goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Click on one of any number of Cadbury products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Drag it through a portal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Visit each day until you&amp;#8217;ve built a bike (you can only do it 5 times per day)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Build a bicycle for someone in Ghana or in their words &amp;#8220;release it to Africa&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The necessary act of coming into virtual contact with a Cadbury product (like Halls, Trident Gum, Sour Peaches or Caramilk Bar) in order to help someone get a bike has &amp;#8220;ick factor&amp;#8221; all over it. It seemed to me that Cadbury had missed a critical opportunity to do something good without acting as a shill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little research quickly took me to the root of the problem. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehiveinc.com/work/cadbury/bicycle-factory&quot;&gt;Toronto agency who created the site in 2009 &lt;/a&gt;describes their work in the following manner:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The days of consumers caring about contests to win a car or a trip are over. These sorts of promotions are everywhere without saying anything about the sponsoring brand. The Bicycle Factory was designed to break through this sea of sameness and give consumers a cause they could relate to and rally behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to &amp;#8220;break through the sea of sameness&amp;#8221; Cadbury has done much worse. They have taken the contest model and applied it to their corporate philanthropy efforts. To take this apart a bit, I&amp;#8217;d like to explore why philanthropy is not like a contest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Reason #1: The issues are more complex and sensitive: &lt;/strong&gt;The &amp;#8216;gaming&amp;#8217; aspect of this promotion creates the sense that Cadbury is making light of very serious issues. Getting kids an education in Ghana is an amazing issue. But, a button that reads &amp;#8220;release to Africa&amp;#8221; makes light of the effort and makes me question whether Cadbury is up for the job. It also has a really bad colonial undertone. Is it just me? First of all Africa is a continent. It&amp;#8217;s kind of a big place to release a bike to. This is about Ghana. So why not make the action about Ghana. Something like &amp;#8220;A Ride to School&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;Send a Bike to Ghana&amp;#8221; would be so much better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Reason #2: Take yourself out of the picture: *&lt;/em&gt;In a contest or simple promotion you can ask people to come into contact with your products. Sure, cut out the UPC code and send it in. Ask me to go online and show proof of purchase. But if you&amp;#8217;re going to show me you care, don&amp;#8217;t make me touch your products&amp;#8211;gum and sour peaches&amp;#8211;even virtually. It feels really bad. If you act as a leader you gain far more credibility than by reminding me that this is all about brand promotion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not saying that a company like Cadbury can&amp;#8217;t do good by engaging their customers in something valuable like sending bikes to Ghana. In fact, I think it&amp;#8217;s a great initiative at its core. But Cadbury needs to be a leader in engaging people on a deeper level than a promotions/contest approach can possibly encompass.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Designing from the Inside Out</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/designing-from-the-inside-out/"/>
   <updated>2012-05-28T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/designing-from-the-inside-out</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Design: the nature of this term is so abstract and so broad it&amp;#8217;s almost impossible to truly define. In a sense, everything is designed. However, not everything is designed well. Many people don&amp;#8217;t realize how design is so much more than just aesthetics. It encapsulates everything from how something feels, to how a person interacts with it. To truly understand design is to understand human nature. The ability to analyze human interaction behaviour is important, because an intuitive experience usually ends with a positive result. The more an end user has to &amp;#8220;figure out&amp;#8221;, the more frustrated they will become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interaction design can occasionally feel like a thankless job, because a great user experience should be transparent in nature. As designers we should be striving to marry the principles of a seamless experience with beautiful aesthetics. For example, if you look at some of the best mobile applications in the world, they are a perfect blend of beautifully detailed interface elements, with a smooth and intuitive user experience. These aesthetics don&amp;#8217;t compromise how one can interact with the app, but rather enhance it with key visuals and a unique style. The fact of the matter is, people are consciously and unconsciously enticed by visual design. However, if the tool is hard to use, it takes away from the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A designer&amp;#8217;s goal should never be to make something look nice. Designers solve problems, and they build products around solving these problems in the most effective manner possible. The aesthetics should be built around the interactions, because the interactions drive the product.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Social innovation lessons from an Athlete.</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/social-innovation-lessons-from-an-athlete/"/>
   <updated>2012-05-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/social-innovation-lessons-from-an-athlete</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I saw Ron Artest start one of the biggest fights in NBA basketball history (Pistons/Pacers). Over his career, he&amp;#8217;s sparked more than his fair share of come-backs and routs. And a few months ago I found out he&amp;#8217;s not waiting around for world leaders to chart a path to world peace. Ron is single-handedly putting the idea in the heads of millions of people around the world, every night the Los Angeles Lakers NBA Franchise plays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He changed his name to &amp;#8220;Metta WorldPeace&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8035/social-innovation-lessons-from-an-athlete/attachment/metta-world-peace-lakers-2&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9288&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-9288&quot; title=&quot;metta-world-peace-Lakers&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/metta-world-peace-Lakers1-580x448.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;448&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Known as a frustrating defensive player to some and a hot-headed trouble maker to others, maybe it shouldn&amp;#8217;t come as a surprise that Artest is making something important happen without worrying about the consequences of failure/ridicule, or the hassles he causes to his employers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve seen the same &amp;#8216;I&amp;#8217;ll figure it out as I go because this project needs to exist&amp;#8217; mentality from luminaries on TED stages and from social innovators managing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1vWJsopgmU&quot; title=&quot;Bendale School Garden&quot;&gt;school gardens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our species is fucked if we deem our businesses &amp;#8216;too big too fail&amp;#8217; but &amp;#8216;world peace &amp;#8216;too big to tackle&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, this isn&amp;#8217;t Artest&amp;#8217;s first fresh idea either. He auctioned off his 2010 NBA championship ring for $500,000 to raise awareness for mental illness. Perhaps even more impactful, he publicly thanked his psychiatrist on national television. In a culture that still whispers about mental illness the way Rob Lowe&amp;#8217;s family did about cancer in the hit &amp;#8217;80s movie &amp;#8220;Class&amp;#8221;, Ron&amp;#8217;s mention is like shining a floodlight on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The way it is&amp;#8221; is a starting point, not an indictment. If more people tackled change in whatever capacity they were capable of, well the world would be a better place. Cities, communities and companies would too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it&amp;#8217;s the only thing that ever has.”&lt;br /&gt; –M. Mead

   <title>Crappie Fishing at Brampton Lake</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/crappie-fishing-at-brampton-lake/"/>
   <updated>2012-05-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/crappie-fishing-at-brampton-lake</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9267/crappie-fishing-at-brampton-lake/attachment/toilet&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9271&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9271&quot; title=&quot;toilet&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/toilet.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;340&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, the fishing&amp;#8217;s pretty crappie at Brampton Lake near Kenora. According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hookandbullet.com/fishing-brampton-lake-kenora-on/&quot;&gt;Hook and Bullet &lt;/a&gt;if you chose to go fishing at Brampton Lake  &amp;#8220;the crappie will be biting your maggots.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a marketer, I&amp;#8217;m thinking that the Crappie fish needs a rebrand. Call me immature but I can&amp;#8217;t help giggling when I read the following lines from websites about Crappie fishing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &amp;#8220;Crappies are separated into two major subspecies: white and black crappie&amp;#8230;The black crappie is easily confused with the white crappie.&amp;#8221;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldfishingnetwork.com/fishing/crappie-fishing.aspx&quot;&gt;World Fishing Network &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &amp;#8220;Crappies are found in thousands of lakes and rivers across the country.&amp;#8221; &lt;a href=&quot;http://adventure.howstuffworks.com/outdoor-activities/fishing/freshwater-tips/panfish/crappie-fishing-tips.htm&quot;&gt;How Stuff Works&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &amp;#8220;On average, a full-grown crappie will measure 10 inches (25 cm)&amp;#8221; &lt;a href=&quot;http://adventure.howstuffworks.com/outdoor-activities/fishing/freshwater-tips/panfish/crappie-fishing-tips.htm&quot;&gt;How Stuff Works&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &amp;#8220;Crappies swim in schools, so when one finds them, there will be many more.&amp;#8221; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freshwater-fishing-tips.com/crappiefishing.html&quot;&gt;Freshwater Fishing Tips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;#8217;ve got a great new tourist slogan for Brampton Lake (since the internet seems to have very little to say about it) &amp;#8220;If you&amp;#8217;re up for some Crappie fishing you gotta get your ass over to Brampton Lake.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What About Bob&#8217;s? How Bob&#8217;s Lake Got its Name</title>

   <id>http://getpoole.com/what-about-bobs-how-bobs-lake-got-its-name</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9240/what-about-bobs-how-bobs-lake-got-its-name/attachment/bob2&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9258&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9258&quot; title=&quot;bob2&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/bob2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;348&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one is quite sure how Bob&amp;#8217;s Lake got its name. It seems not many Bobs passed through Frontenac region in Eastern Ontario in the mid Nineteenth Century. According to the book &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Dammed_Lakes.html?id=POhfAAAACAAJ&amp;amp;redir_esc=y&quot;&gt;The Dammed Lakes, An Environmental History of Crow and Bobs Lake&lt;/a&gt;s the lake was named after the member of a native band&amp;#8211;either Algonquin or Mississauga&amp;#8211;who passed through the region. Here are a list of possible Bob candidates:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  There were two Mississauga named Robert – Blacker and Mitchell. But neither was called “Bob” and neither has a known connection to the lake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  There was a Mississauga named “Bob” but he left the region in 1827&amp;#8211;too early in time for his name to be passed along&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  There were European settlers named Robert, but again no known Bobs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may take some time before the mystery of Bob&amp;#8217;s lake is resolved. But until then&amp;#8230;.baby steps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Only Constant is Change- Heraclitus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day it becomes more evident that the socio-economic model we’ve been dependent on is cracking beneath our feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This animation by &lt;a title=&quot;Cultivate Community Resilience&quot; href=&quot;http://www.resilience.cultivate.ie/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cultivate&lt;/a&gt; demonstrates the importance of resilience in building new models by comparing it to surfing. It looks at the themes of  personal and community resilience and facing global transition to reflect on how to best manage significant social shifts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like surfers, agents of change have to act with courage, learn through experience and adapt quickly so they can make the most of the resources they have while going with the flow&amp;#8211;especially in times of crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check it out!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello, hello! My name is Collin Henderson, and I&amp;#8217;m a computer programming student at Niagara College, interning at Hypenotic. I specialize in web design, user experiences, and front-end development. After my internship here, I have one more semester of school before I graduate with a Computer Programmer Analyst diploma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve always been enamoured with all things on the web. I&amp;#8217;ve been designing and developing websites for around five years now, and am always keen to learn the new and emerging technologies that come with it. During my days here at Hypenotic, I&amp;#8217;m usually kept busy with a variety of work such as tweaking WordPress themes, developing responsive solutions for web pages, and trying to get the office puppy Blue, to like me. During evenings and weekends, I like to hack away at a plethora of different projects using fun tech like PHP, MySQL, Node.js, Socket.io, Objective-C, etc. I also love to play volleyball, and enjoy composing music of all sorts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to continuing to work with this great team, here at Hypenotic. I&amp;#8217;m sure I&amp;#8217;ll learn a ton while I&amp;#8217;m here, and hopefully have the opportunity to share some of my own skills with others.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Presentation tips from history&#8217;s greatest communicators</title>

   <id>http://getpoole.com/presentation-tips-from-historys-greatest-communicators</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve done A LOT of presenting over the last ten years. At conferences, in board rooms and informally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love it. But I still sweat it. Every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#8217;s because I believe there&amp;#8217;s an unwritten contract between the speaker and the audience. In exchange for some considered attention, people have a right be floored. Moved. At the very least, they ned to be engaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just watched a TedTalk Nancy Duarte gave a couple of years ago that&amp;#8217;s going to make me sweat even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By her standards, your presentation is no less than a vehicle to help you change the world. Key ideas include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Presenter isn&amp;#8217;t the hero, the audience is–presenter is the mentor, shepherding the audience from one place to another&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  There&amp;#8217;s a rhythm to this journey, and the greatest presenters, from Dr. King to Steve Jobs have availed themselves of it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Nancy, you can change the world on whatever scale you need to for your idea to exist, just don&amp;#8217;t keep your idea bottled up.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://getpoole.com/new-kid-on-the-block</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello there!  After finishing up my second week here at Hypenotic as the newest Graphic Design Intern, I thought it was about time to introduce myself. My name is Christopher Hebert and I am currently entering my fourth and final year at Sheridan College’s Bachelor of Applied Arts Illustration Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, Hypenotic is proving to be worthy of the early morning alarm and commute that I&amp;#8217;ve been getting used to. I work in a downtown studio space complete with eleven large windows, my own desk (displayed below, along with things I enjoy), a smiling and talented staff, and of course, Blue, a cute Australian Sheppard that won’t let me touch him. I’ve got no complaints. Like I said, the staff are a great group of people and their mission to create meaningful marketing for good things reflects in their personalities. So, for the next couple of months, while I’m not trying to win the friendship of Blue, I am going to be building connections with my colleagues so that I can learn some new skills from them, maybe even vice versa. I hope you have a lovely Friday, and you’ll be hearing from me again soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/fun-stuff/9182/new-kid-on-the-block/attachment/mydesk&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9185&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9185&quot; title=&quot;Mydesk&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Mydesk.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;491&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not everyday UFO sightings happen in and around Ontario Lakes. Unless you happen to be talking about Minden&amp;#8217;s Boshkung Lake in the early 70&amp;#8242;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minden residents, Mr and Mrs. Ashley Lunham,  were visited by a wide range of alien objects in 1973 and 74. The visits were so frequent, in fact, that they referred to the frozen lake outside their home as a &amp;#8220;virtual parking lot.&amp;#8221;  Some of the objects were shaped like cigars, other like polliwogs. They had sometimes red, blue and white lights. They always displayed nine antennae and their takeoff resembled a rubber ball. Curt Sutherly&amp;#8217;s book &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.ca/books?id=uVL7BCSdv5gC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;dq=ufo+mysteries&amp;amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=ufo%20mysteries&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;UFO Mysteries &lt;/a&gt; has an entire chapter dedicated to &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.ca/books?id=uVL7BCSdv5gC&amp;amp;pg=PA57&amp;amp;dq=boshkung&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=le-fT9h36LXoAeefgIAC&amp;amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=boshkung&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;The Invasion of Boshkung Lak&lt;/a&gt;e. In it he features all of the folks who also witnessed the strange flying objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sutherly&amp;#8217;s book features a local journalist who decided to take on the case.  After several fruitless visits to the frozen lake the journalist, equipped with a camera, finally saw an object with a red light high over lake Boshkung.  It was then that ten snowmobilers  from Minden arrived on the ice and began shooting at the object, attempting to ambush the interlopers. A &amp;#8220;distinct clunk&amp;#8221; could be heard as bullets careened off the flying objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A local housewife, Mrs. Barnes, who was among 50 witnesses to the bizarre object that night commented &amp;#8220;We can&amp;#8217;t all be crazy.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why this gardening infographic works for content strategy</title>

   <updated>2012-05-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/why-this-gardening-infographic-works-for-content-strategy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At least half of our clients process an amazing amount of interesting data in the course of doing what they see as their main job: Making change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re often able to convince them to turn bits of their learning into by-products that can do triple duty as marketing and a way to keep people informed about what they&amp;#8217;re up to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This poster does a great job of breaking down a task that might be daunting to address as a whole into chewable parts. Usability and productivity experts will agree that breaking down tasks into their most easily actionable components gives them a much better shot of getting done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The illustration style and written language are warm and inviting, further disarming apprehension about a new task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site that put it together uses these shareable and shareworthy pieces of content as marketing. If you can get your head around the idea, the keys are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Solve a problem for people so that searchers find it and people that create resources want to share it with their audiences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Do a professional job of it (solid facts, smart copy and beautiful aesthetics) so people want to look at it and share it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Reach out to people and places that might want to share it with you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Include a link to the actual image that brings traffic back to your site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Have a page on your site ready to receive them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Cite your sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Ontario Lakes Project: Blue Heron Lake</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/ontario-lakes-project-blue-heron-lake/"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/ontario-lakes-project/9097/ontario-lakes-project-blue-heron-lake/attachment/blueheron-5&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9151&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9151&quot; title=&quot;blueheron&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/blueheron3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;318&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the winter of 2004-2005, the famous Blue Heron Lake snapping turtle, with a huge shell measuring over 5 feet passed away due to natural causes. He was one of the lucky ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/02/21/groups-ask-ontario-turtle-hunters-to-snap-out-of-it/&quot;&gt;According to a recent report&lt;/a&gt;, hunting, highway roadkill and habitat loss are threatening the snapping turtle species. A coalition has been formed calling for an end to snapping turtle hunting  for their turtle meat which is (apparently) sold on the black market. One of the organizations behind the report says&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While we must find long-term solutions to deal with these threats, the province has the power to give snappers a fighting chance today by ending the hunt.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
   The prehistoric creatures continue to live in Blue Heron Lake despite ongoing threats. Recently, there has been a sighting of another enormous snapping turtle&amp;#8211;this one with a much smaller shell, measuring a measly 3 feet.

   <title>Getting the most out of your designer</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/getting-the-most-out-of-your-designer/"/>
   <updated>2012-04-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/getting-the-most-out-of-your-designer</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In 1998 I started a design company when I realized that freelancing was the same thing as running a business. Boy was I wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, I was on a 15 year track in which I evolved from a designer creating a job for himself to a entrepreneur with a mission and a team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might imagine, I read EVERY book available on the subject of running a design business. Read isn&amp;#8217;t the right word. Consumed is more like it. I was ravenous/desperate for insight into what I was doing right, what I was doing wrong, what other people did and what other people didn&amp;#8217;t do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allworth.com/search/?searchtext=tad+crawford&amp;amp;fa=search&quot; title=&quot;Tad Crawford&amp;#39;s books&quot;&gt;Tad Crawford&amp;#8217;s books&lt;/a&gt; and bought his CDs. I read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.recourses.com/&quot; title=&quot;Recourses&quot;&gt;ReCourses&lt;/a&gt; stuff. I downloaded forms, tested briefs, was humbled by methodologies and always felt several steps behind a rapidly changing practice. I didn&amp;#8217;t have the fundamentals from business school, didn&amp;#8217;t apprentice at a great shop and steal their methodology, and only realized I was an &amp;#8216;entreprenuer&amp;#8217; a few years in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I started reading a book that trumps everything I&amp;#8217;ve read put together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abookapart.com/products/design-is-a-job&quot; title=&quot;Design is a Job by Mike Monteiro&quot;&gt;DESIGN IS A JOB&lt;/a&gt; by Mike Monteiro validates all of my beliefs and vindicates tough choices I&amp;#8217;ve made as recently as two weeks ago. It&amp;#8217;s staring at my disapprovingly through my ipad regarding a few things I know better about but have been putting off. It has reminded me of things I knew were important but forgot. And it&amp;#8217;s even taught me a few new tricks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part is I still have 100 pages left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_9134&quot; style=&quot;width: 590px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-9134 &quot; title=&quot;DIAJ-feature_1&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DIAJ-feature_1-580x266.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;266&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    Stolen off the A Book Apart site. Hope it&#39;s cool since I&#39;m endorsing it :)
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#8217;m not suggesting you read this if you&amp;#8217;re a designer. Go ahead, but unless you&amp;#8217;re already inclined to work in sync with your values, a lot of what you implement from the book will still feel like you&amp;#8217;re faking it. You know who you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, this one is for clients. This book will give you more insight into the motivations, care and value of a service provider than anything I&amp;#8217;ve ever seen. And I think you&amp;#8217;ll be safe applying what you learn to just about any professional creative services provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I&amp;#8217;m cheating a bit by sharing this with you. It&amp;#8217;s a peak behind the curtain at the heart, nervous system and engine of a designer. On the other hand, the spirit of the book is about a partnership approach, so the more you can empathize with our needs–what it takes to hit it out of the park for you, the more dynamic our opportunities are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want just one of the 50 pearls of wisdom I&amp;#8217;ve underlined?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beware of clients who have waited to call you until they have a perfect diagram of what they need and want you to color it in. If they’re not coming to you for strategy and problem-solving, they’re not coming to you for design, they’re coming to you for production. And if you take on production work, you don’t get to call yourself a designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want another?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can roll your eyes at how much they don’t understand about design or you can roll up your sleeves and begin practicing your craft by helping them clarify what they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t wait, but don&amp;#8217;t be surprised if I buy you a copy for the next holiday.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Change.org Arrives in Canada</title>

  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9106/change-org-arrives-in-canada/attachment/screen-shot-2012-04-27-at-4-15-25-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9107&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9107&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2012-04-27 at 4.15.25 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Screen-shot-2012-04-27-at-4.15.25-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;271&quot; height=&quot;329&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  What do doughnuts, Canadian youth and potable water have in common? They are related to three of the high profile petitions currently circulating because of online platform Change.org.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.change.org&quot;&gt;Change.org&lt;/a&gt; Canadians have spearheaded campaigns to;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.change.org/petitions/tim-hortons-stop-supporting-farm-animal-cruelty&quot;&gt;Encourage Tim Hortons&lt;/a&gt; to stop using pork and eggs from farms with inhumane practices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Make sure the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.change.org/petitions/safe-water-now-for-canadas-1st-nations-communities&quot;&gt;Canadian Government ensures that there&amp;#8217;s safe, potable water&lt;/a&gt; in First Nations communities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.change.org/petitions/minister-of-canadian-heritage-don-t-kill-katimavik&quot;&gt;Influence the Minister of Canadian Heritage&lt;/a&gt; to reconsider shutting down youth organization, Katimavik&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change.org already has 450,000 Canadians signed up as members and they&amp;#8217;re in their early days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the platform has on-the-ground Canadian presence in the form of Campaigns Director &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.change.org/members/5164180&quot;&gt;Jordy Gold&lt;/a&gt; and his associate Campaigner Lauryn Drainie.  Jordy and I are on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.notfarfromthetree.org/&quot;&gt;Not for From the Tree &lt;/a&gt;Steering Committee together and since entering his new role I&amp;#8217;ve enjoyed listening to him literally overflow with enthusiasm for the impact Change.org is having all around the world. Results like getting the &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.change.org/stories/bullied-high-schooler-convinces-mpaa-to-change-bully-rating-to-pg-13&quot;&gt;MPAA to overturn its &amp;#8216;R&amp;#8217; rating of the &amp;#8216;Bully&amp;#8217; movie &lt;/a&gt;and stopping the &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.change.org/stories/a-letter-from-bettina-siegel-pink-slime-petition-creator&quot;&gt;spread of Pink Slime&lt;/a&gt; in meat products in schools across the US make me undertand what he&amp;#8217;s so jazzed about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does on the ground Canadian presence for Change.org mean? I asked Jordy the same question. His response? Change.org in Canada means:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  A stronger push than ever to get more Canadians engaged in the issues featured on Change.org&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Exponential impact for the petitions that resonate with Canadians. When a campaign catches on, Change.org takes notice and steps in to provide campaign support and spread the word. More Canadians will get this kind of support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  More &amp;#8220;Canadian-Content&amp;#8221; that truly speaks to the people of the true north strong and free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s never been a better time to start a petition on Change.org. Mine the site for tips and tricks to build a killer campaign and spread the word. In the meantime,  watch out for Canadian campaigns getting more profile than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Welcome to Hypenotic, Chris</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/welcome-to-hypenotic-chris/"/>
   <updated>2012-04-23T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/welcome-to-hypenotic-chris</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My name’s Rebecca and I’m Hypenotic’s bookkeeper. Barry is not a silo thinker. He believes that everyone at Hypenotic should have the opportunity to write for the blog… even the bookkeeper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my long distant past I wrote for Canadian Tire’s employee newsletter, so I&amp;#8217;m not a complete newbie, but it’s nice to know I can get back in the saddle when called upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather forecast today called for flurries. This was a bit disconcerting as it is April 23 and Hypenotic’s Summer Intern–Chris Hebert’s–first day on the job. Chris is from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sheridancollege.ca/programs%20and%20courses/full-time%20programs/programs%20a-z%20index/bachelor%20of%20applied%20arts%20-%20illustration.aspx&quot; title=&quot;Sheridan College Bachelor of Applied Arts (Illustration)&quot;&gt;Sheridan&lt;/a&gt; (who we do a lot with) and is at Hypenotic to earn his 420 hours work experience. I’m sure he’ll be introducing himself in his own blog post, but I’m using his joining Hypenotic as a springboard to launch my first blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the Interns. I love their energy, their eagerness, their freshness and readiness to take on any task, and yes, I even love their youthful naivete.  They are here to learn, and what an opportunity we have to teach them. They already know some theory, but this isn’t the classroom; they aren’t being inculcated through books and lectures. This is reality. This is diving into the deep end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is where they’ll learn about teamwork and deadlines. Here is where they’ll learn to grow a thick skin as their project is edited till it no longer resembles their work. Here is where they learn to put aside their handheld devices and focus their attentions on their work. Here is where they’ll learn how to keep track of their hours and invoice for the time they worked. Here is where they’ll complete their education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Hypenotic Chris.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Are daily deals sites right for you?</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/are-daily-deals-sites-right-for-you/"/>
   <updated>2012-04-23T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/are-daily-deals-sites-right-for-you</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Seth Godin (the world&amp;#8217;s most prolific/down to earth marketing guru) has a line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Share of wallet is easier, more profitable and ultimately more effective a measure than share of market&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which to me means that doing more with people who already appreciate you is better for you business long term. Makes sense. Most of us are familiar with the basic cost savings in selling, teaching, moving forward and maintaining projects with people we have an existing relationship with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Your best customers are worth far more than your average customers&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes me consider the ancillary benefits in a relationship with someone who values your offering. Beyond making it easier for you to serve them, they can be the ultimate source of better qualified leads. The people they send your way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  will be coming via someone they trust, and should be therefore easier to start a relationship with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  will be coming for the right reasons, increasing the chances they&amp;#8217;re a good fit for you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article I&amp;#8217;ll link you to in a second makes perhaps the most critical case for considering whether so-called daily deals site like Groupon are right for you. It, and the 100+ comments offer a solid education in thinking holistically about sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the article while searching for a quote I love about paying for things worth paying for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you buy something cheap and bad, the best you’re going to feel about it is when you buy it. When you buy something expensive and good, the worst you’re going to feel about it is when you buy it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I&amp;#8217;ve leaned towards the sentiment shared by the author when he says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The customers you attract only with a discount will disregard what you love about your own business, and won&amp;#8217;t treat you with respect; both sides usually regret the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the very first comment makes the point that, carefully considered, one could craft a deal that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  brings in the right prospective customers/partners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  introduces them to new items&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  sells things you can still make a margin on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have a lingering distaste in my gut for the practice, but either way, you can certainly get insight to better inform your decision from the following post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.redfin.com/blog/2010/09/groupons_success_disaster.html&quot;&gt;Groupon’s Success Disaster | Redfin Corporate Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Social Enterprise: Finding the Right Fit</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/9041/"/>
   <updated>2012-04-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/9041</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9041/9041/attachment/screen-shot-2012-04-20-at-3-34-52-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9062&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-9062&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2012-04-20 at 3.34.52 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Screen-shot-2012-04-20-at-3.34.52-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;470&quot; height=&quot;385&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More and more non-profits are looking at ways to earn revenue through social enterprise initiatives. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.girlscouts.org/program/gs_cookies/cookie_history/&quot;&gt;Girl Scout Cookies&lt;/a&gt; are one of the earliest examples of earned revenue for non profits.&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.girlscouts.org/program/gs_cookies/cookie_history/&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;The cookie program started innocently enough at the turn of the century with Troop moms raised money through bake sales. The idea took off and in the 1970&amp;#8242;s (just when you&amp;#8217;d expect), the cookies were processed and sold in boxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you thought the cookies were &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thepetitionsite.com/1/stop-the-girl-scout-cookie-lie/&quot;&gt;controversial&lt;/a&gt;, check out The Girl Scouts&amp;#8217; latest social venture which I spotted at a &lt;a href=&quot;http://michaels.com/&quot;&gt;Michael&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; craft store in South Florida.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9041/9041/attachment/screen-shot-2012-04-16-at-6-16-19-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9042&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-9042&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2012-04-16 at 6.16.19 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Screen-shot-2012-04-16-at-6.16.19-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;294&quot; height=&quot;402&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pictured above is one example of &amp;#8220;girl-centric&amp;#8221; crafts being sold under the &amp;#8220;Girl Scouts&amp;#8221; brand. The line consists of scrapbooking kits, stickers, beads, stationary, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s wrong with the social enterprise initiative?  While it might do its job to create earned revenue for Girl Scouts, in the long term this kind of social enterprise undermines the Girl Scouts&amp;#8217; brand. Here&amp;#8217;s why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;The Product Cheapens the Brand:&lt;/strong&gt; When you&amp;#8217;re a values based organization, producing &amp;#8220;stuff&amp;#8221; risks cheapening your brand. That&amp;#8217;s because it takes your organization&amp;#8217;s mission and tries to turn it into a &amp;#8220;thing.&amp;#8221; This is a process that has to be undertaken very delicately, especially because there&amp;#8217;s alot on the line.  Girl Scouts is a 150 year old organization with the following stated mission: &amp;#8220;Girl Scouting builds girls of courage, confidence, and character, who make the world a better place.&amp;#8221; The foam beads pictured above don&amp;#8217;t demonstrate that mission to me. In fact, the cheap, throwaway nature of the products makes me question Girl Scouts&amp;#8217; sincerity in all they do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Avoid Contradicting Yourself: *&lt;/em&gt;The Michaels/Girl Scout craft products may capture the &amp;#8220;girly&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;friendship&amp;#8221; dimensions of the Girl Scout brand, but many essential elements of the brand are left out&amp;#8211;or worse, contradicted. The Girl Scouts are connected to all kinds of good stuff beyond the obvious&amp;#8211;they teach girls about community service, the outdoors, how to be people of character. This year, the Girl Scouts have decided to shine a light on their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.girlscouts.org/gsforevergreen/&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;Green&amp;#8221; platform&lt;/a&gt; by encouraging scouts to plant trees, reduce waste, etc. Somehow these &lt;a href=&quot;http://michaels.com/girl-scouts-adhesive-foam-shapes/kd2578,default,pd.html?cgid=products-kidsteachers-girlscouts&amp;amp;start=1&quot;&gt;Girl Scout Adhesive Foam Shapes&lt;/a&gt; aren&amp;#8217;t communicating that message to me. In fact, the crafts fly in the face of the nature-centric dimension of the brand. This doesn&amp;#8217;t mean that the Girl Scouts should &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; be in the business of partnering to sell &amp;#8220;stuff.&amp;#8221; But what they choose to sell has to connects to all of their values&amp;#8211;and not just the easy &amp;#8220;light&amp;#8221; ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Dig Deeper: *&lt;/em&gt;Instead of creating a social enterprise based on the most obvious or glaring dimensions of your brand (Girl Scouts = Girls = Girly Crafts) think about reaching into the places that are a bit deeper in the gullet of your soul. That&amp;#8217;s where there&amp;#8217;s less competition and greater chance to develop an enterprise that provides something truly useful that resonates. What if Girl Scouts&amp;#8217; social enterprise helped girls establish and reach community service goals? Or, what if their  products helped girls learn survivalist skills or play more team sports? There&amp;#8217;s a rich legacy behind the Girl Scouts and its founder Juliette &amp;#8220;Daisy&amp;#8221; Gordon Low. It&amp;#8217;s worthy of a deeper, richer interpretation of the brand and its core value as a women&amp;#8217;s organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Things I have learned at Ladies Learning Code</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/things-i-have-learned-at-ladies-learning-code/"/>
   <updated>2012-04-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/things-i-have-learned-at-ladies-learning-code</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9014/things-i-have-learned-at-ladies-learning-code/attachment/workshop1-javascript&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9017&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-9017&quot; title=&quot;Workshop1- JavaScript&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Workshop1-JavaScript-580x386.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;386&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday I had the opportunity to lead my second Photoshop workshop as part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://ladieslearningcode.com/&quot;&gt;Ladies Learning Code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was first introduced to LLC through my friend Ayla who was attending a group of women entrepreneurs in Toronto where she first met the founder &lt;a href=&quot;http://heatherpayne.ca/&quot;&gt;Heather Payne&lt;/a&gt;. Heather had been organizing workshops to introduce women to programing since last summer with a very good turnout and was interested in offering a design related course as a next step, she needed designers to volunteer as lead instructors and mentors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first met with Heather for drinks at the Drake Hotel. We had a nice chat, she told us a bit about herself and how after attending a workshop on Python with a group called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pyladies.com/&quot;&gt;PyLadies&lt;/a&gt; in LA she felt inspired to start something similar in Toronto. After tweeting about it and organizing a massive brainstorming session Ladies Learning Code was born with the objective to empower women to develop technical skills that are usually associated with men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved to hear about Heather’s project and I became excited to take on the challenge and become a lead instructor. We started working on the curriculum and ended up dividing the course into 4 lessons each one developed and led by a different designer: &lt;a href=&quot;http://aylanewhouse.com/&quot;&gt;Ayla Newhouse&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;http://dribbble.com/RDBannon&quot;&gt; Ryan Bannon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://charlottetang.com/&quot;&gt;Charlotte Tang&lt;/a&gt; and myself for the first edition and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/#!/erinmorris&quot;&gt;Erin Morris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://christopherappleton.com/&quot;&gt;Chris Appleton&lt;/a&gt; in the second one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main objectives of LLC’s workshops is to give attendees the chance to produce something useful during the day. The Photoshop workshop focuses on personal brand through practical exercises for students to create a twitter background, a logo, a timeline cover for Facebook and an optimized profile picture. All these elements contribute to building a more consistent online identity and are later grouped in a personalized moodboard. It is a lot of ground to cover in one day for a beginner’s course in Photoshop but it’s great to see how it actually happens!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the main things I learned in my first two experiences in teaching:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Preparing a class takes time.&lt;/strong&gt; Structuring content, dissecting the process step by step, designing slides with instructions and diagrams and making a script took time and patience. Fortunately I had feedback from my co instructors and after a dry run in front of all the mentors and people involved in the workshop I felt ready.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Teaching is a learning experience.&lt;/strong&gt; I learned a lot of things I didn’t know about Photoshop and about the different ways other designers use the program. After 10 years using Photoshop I had never fully understood cropping masks until now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Teaching is exhausting&lt;/strong&gt;. I had never had to talk so much in front of so many people (each classroom had 40 people). At the beginning of the day I felt very self-conscious (worrying about everything from my English pronunciation to explaining my ideas clearly) but as the hours passed I started feeling more comfortable. I definitely have newfound respect for everyone who is a teacher and does this every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Teaching is fulfilling.&lt;/strong&gt; Watching the students go from &lt;a href=&quot;http://theargosgirlchronicles.wordpress.com/2012/04/15/how-i-went-from-photoshop-oblivious-to-photoshop-empowered/&quot;&gt;oblivious to empowered&lt;/a&gt; and seeing them upload their projects to Facebook and Twitter at the end of the day gave me a great sense of achievement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Teaching connects you with a lot of cool people.&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes being a designer can be isolating, I feel like I spend too much time in front of the computer with headphones on, living in my own world. I’ve been very happy to  get out of my bubble and connect with such great people: everyone from mentors, sponsors, organizers, instructors and attendees all giving the best of themselves to share and learn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next step will be taking the WordPress workshop. If you are interested in participating with Ladies Learning Code I recommend you check out their coming events &lt;a href=&quot;http://ladieslearningcode.com/events/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. (BTW men are welcome too!)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>It&#8217;s never been more important to steal from the British Government</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/its-never-been-more-important-to-steal-from-the-british-government/"/>
   <updated>2012-04-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/its-never-been-more-important-to-steal-from-the-british-government</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Former Hypenotic team member/perennial Hypenotic community member Jorge sent over a site I can&amp;#8217;t get enough of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British Government is moving their communications strategy into the 21st century and it looks they&amp;#8217;re doing everything right. If it wouldn&amp;#8217;t be too much to ask, I think everyone who commissions web design should steal the tenets of their &amp;#8220;Government Digital Service Design Principles&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#8217;t seen such amazing clarity in web design principles since Patrick J. Lynch and Sarah Horton&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;&lt;a title=&quot;Web Style Guide book at Yale University Press&quot; href=&quot;http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=0300137370&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Web Style Guide&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; (now in it&amp;#8217;s 3rd edition)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8990/its-never-been-more-important-to-steal-from-the-british-government/attachment/screen-shot-2012-04-09-at-1-24-34-pm-2&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-8996&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8996&quot; title=&quot;Screen Shot 2012-04-09 at 1.24.34 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Screen-Shot-2012-04-09-at-1.24.34-PM1-580x337.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;337&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s so great about it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, there&amp;#8217;s a pop up warning that explains to first time visitors that the digital design guidelines are publicly available as an ALPHA release, not as &amp;#8220;to-don&amp;#8217;t&amp;#8221; list, but for inspiration and education. They want to let visitors know that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The site and methodology are a work in progress and will be iterated on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Websites are not an end in themselves, they&amp;#8217;re a way for prospective site users (people) to fulfill &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That a formal institution most often associated with bureaucracy is publicly releasing something by definition unfinished is a heretical act that will surely be whispered about by cultures trained to put their best foot forward always. But the web is changing all the time, and ever more rapidly. If the medium is fluid, shouldn&amp;#8217;t the messages be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inspiration is also manifest in the site&amp;#8217;s own simple, accessible, even inviting interface. There&amp;#8217;s plenty of negative space (space between page elements) to make people feel like there&amp;#8217;s no hurry here (&amp;#8220;Keep calm&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;), no hidden tricks that only the cognoscenti will understand. Good design is for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website is also a boon for Designers, who can use it help turn clients into partners. While it can come pretty naturally for designers to see and solve other people&amp;#8217;s communications problems, we&amp;#8217;re notoriously our own worst clients. Since we can always think of ways to improve, getting our own work out the door is hard. With the insight our clients can pick up from this site, we can both be better collaborators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design is as much an approach–a mindset, as it is a process. And the Gov.UK Design Principles articulate the tenets of this approach in way that at once democratizes great design while rewarding it&amp;#8217;s practitioners. Anyone can benefit from knowing these principles. And understanding the tenets makes it a lot easier for the lay person to spot professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will still be plenty of unlearning for people to do. We&amp;#8217;ve been conditioned to think of websites as modern versions of traditional marketing items like brochures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, the system that pays for their development is still largely framed by the wrong measures, the wrong motivations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;my dept needs real estate on the front page&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ve already sold these banners&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, these objectives are misguided in a system that puts the visitor&amp;#8217;s needs at the centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, we&amp;#8217;re not spending our own money when designing websites, and accountability means a very literal form of short term return on investment that ends up being a &amp;#8220;lose/lose&amp;#8221; for all parties. The hard part is remembering we&amp;#8217;re not designing screens, we&amp;#8217;re designing experiences. For people. The hard part is manifest in the up front thinking and planning. So that&amp;#8217;s what should be done. And paid for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there will still be plenty of hand-holding to help people address the perceptual challenges of each tenet. Designing user experiences is almost uniformly counterintuitive for traditional marketers. But I hope this site will be the starting point of many great conversations and even more subtle changes in web site design for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could go on about the site all day, but maybe it&amp;#8217;d be better if we regroup after you&amp;#8217;ve had a look at it?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Anxious? Maybe this is why</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/anxious-maybe-this-is-why/"/>
   <updated>2012-04-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/anxious-maybe-this-is-why</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I moved to Toronto in &amp;#8217;96 with a fresh degree in advertising design from a great institution and &lt;a href=&quot;http://vpa.syr.edu/&quot; title=&quot;Syracuse University School of Visual and Performing Arts&quot;&gt;program&lt;/a&gt;, and was relatively bright eyed and cheery about my opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a gig at Saatchi, and started my morning walks across downtown Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#8217;t long before several things about the experience started to conflict with my values, but I&amp;#8217;ll never forget realizing that I&amp;#8217;d started to put my head down as I was walking to work. The visual cacophony of marketing message blinking and blathering were wrecking a perfectly pleasant walk. They also, as much as anything, set me on the career path I&amp;#8217;ve been on since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw this video this morning and felt like it was chicken soup for my values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is that while plenty of media power has shifted to consumers, there&amp;#8217;s also a lot more media over all. It&amp;#8217;s probably worth re-watching this from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>On April 18th, ontario craft beer buys edible gardens for school kids.</title>

   <id>http://getpoole.com/on-april-18th-ontario-craft-beer-buys-edible-gardens-for-school-kids</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At a fundraiser dinner a few years ago, I sat next to a nice fellow from &lt;a title=&quot;Muskoka Brewery Website&quot; href=&quot;http://www.muskokabrewery.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Muskoka Brewery&lt;/a&gt; who explained to me what it took to get their products listed in The Beer Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_8961&quot; style=&quot;width: 335px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8960/on-april-18th-ontario-craft-beer-buys-edible-gardens-for-school-kids/attachment/beerstoreinternal&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-8961&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-8961  &quot; title=&quot;beerstoreinternal&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/beerstoreinternal-580x435.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;325&quot; height=&quot;244&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    Beer store wall. Image from: http://sophiebury.ca/ocanada/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/beerstoreinternal.jpg
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I recall, getting your label posted on a wall 15 feet up there costs entrepreneurs $50,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remarked that the gov&amp;#8217;t didn&amp;#8217;t seem to be trying to make it easy for our burgeoning craft beer industry to connect with prospects, and that&amp;#8217;s when the next shocker dropped. I learned that our beer stores were owned by three large brands: Molson, Labatt and Sleeman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was particularly disturbing because it occurred to me that they&amp;#8217;d kept Beer Stores looking so crummy for all these years to maintain the illusion that they were government owned. Digging in further, I learned that each of those organizations are in turn owned by Multinationals based in other countries. Labatt by &lt;a title=&quot;Annheuser Busch Inbev website&quot; href=&quot;http://www.ab-inbev.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ABInbev&lt;/a&gt;, Sleeman by &lt;a title=&quot;Sapporo Beer website&quot; href=&quot;http://www.sapporobeer.ca/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sapporo&lt;/a&gt; and Molson is actually &lt;a title=&quot;Molson Coors Website.&quot; href=&quot;http://www.molsoncoorscanada.com/en/Index.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Molson Coors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s still all a bit confounding, but anecdotally, I do feel that it&amp;#8217;s getting easier to find local craft beer. The LCBO does carry a few, the kinds of bars and restaurants I get to carry them and they&amp;#8217;re increasingly found at Ontario events. Which brings me to the original point of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Brewer&amp;#8217;s Plate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  I&amp;#8217;m on the steering committee of an event that brings together craft brewers, dynamic artisans and some of the Province&amp;#8217;s best chefs to raise funds for a different local sustainable food initiative each year. Last year the beneficiary was &lt;a title=&quot;Not Far From the Tree Website&quot; href=&quot;www.notfarfromthetree.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Not far From the Tree&lt;/a&gt;. This Year it&amp;#8217;s &lt;a title=&quot;Green Thumbs Growing Kids Website&quot; href=&quot;www.kidsgrowing.ca/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Green Thumbs Growing Kids&lt;/a&gt;. Here&amp;#8217;s a bit about them:
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  Starting with the idea of connecting children to their food, we give them the tools to grow, harvest and enjoy food through hands-on learning programs on public school and park lands. Food produced in the school garden during the school year goes into lunch or snack programs &amp;#8211; into students&amp;#8217; mouths. Summer produce is equally distributed among volunteers and families who participate in the garden work.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-7213 alignleft&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-10-14 at 11.21.58 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Screen-shot-2011-10-14-at-11.21.58-AM1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;242&quot; height=&quot;221&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  I&amp;#8217;ve really enjoyed the Brewer&amp;#8217;s Plate over the last few years. Last year I even won a dream auction item:

  &lt;a href=&quot;http://brewersplatetoronto.org/buytickets/tell-us-about-yourself.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tickets&lt;/a&gt; are $125 (no hst) which is pretty good for the amount of professionals showing up at a fun venue for a fun night and a great cause.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  Come if you can.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  Certainly share it with friends into beer, food or teaching kids the value of/feeding them real food.

&lt;p&gt;Any questions?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Email Etiquette: A review we could all benefit from</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/email-etiquette-a-review-we-could-all-benefit-from/"/>
   <updated>2012-04-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/email-etiquette-a-review-we-could-all-benefit-from</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sorry if this is a little 101 for some of you, but I had it set as an unfinished draft, probably hastily scrabbled together when someone who should know better abused my email reading patience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is that while email is ubiquitous and benefits us in too many obvious ways to warrant a blog post, one conversation we hear about increasingly is the burden of addressing it. Email&amp;#8217;s ease of use lends itself to careless, ignorant and deliberately layered use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#8217;s a critical piece of email etiquette that some people could benefit from. I pulled it from a great list of 101 tips. Some of them are outdated or matter less depending on your platform or situation, but I&amp;#8217;ve grabbed one section in particular here to focus on (my comments are in [ ]):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;To, From, CC, BCc, RR, Subject:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Only use Cc: when it is important for those you Cc: to know about the contents of the email. Overuse can cause your emails to be ignored. [&lt;em&gt;I have 1000s unread&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Don&amp;#8217;t use Return Receipt (RR) on every single email. Doing so is viewed as intrusive, annoying and can be declined by the other side anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Include addresses in the To: field for those who you would like a response from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Include addresses in the Cc: field for those who you are just FYI&amp;#8217;ing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Make sure your name is displayed properly in the From: field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Remove addresses from the To:, CC; and BCc: field that don&amp;#8217;t need to see your reply. [&lt;em&gt;BIG ONE. Unnecessary email can mean junkmail to some or just more work for others&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Always include a brief Subject. No subject can get your email flagged as spam. [&lt;em&gt;A good subject is like leaving a good phone message–it can help the recipient act more quickly&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Think about your motives when adding addresses to To:, CC:, BCc. Use your discretion. [&lt;em&gt;Many people Cc: as an ass covering measure–think about how that looks to the recipient&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Never expose your friend&amp;#8217;s or contact&amp;#8217;s email address to strangers by listing them all in the To: field. Use BCc:! [&lt;em&gt;BIG ONE. Email is private.Even if you trust the people you share  addresses with, it may make the owners of the addresses uncomfortable. Also, if enough people do this, everyone will have everyone&amp;#39;s addresses&lt;/em&gt;].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure when using BCc: that your intentions are proper. To send BCc: copies to others as a way of talking behind someone&amp;#8217;s back is inconsiderate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.101emailetiquettetips.com/&quot;&gt;Email Etiquette: 101 Email Etiquette Tips&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proper, or at least thoughtful use of basic tools like email can help us handle the exploding media fire-hose enough to keep benefitting from it. If you feel someone just isn&amp;#8217;t respecting your privacy or time, you can always send them here: http://www.thanksbutno.com/&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>When the Rubber Hit the Road at The Gladstone Hotel</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/when-the-rubber-hit-the-road-at-the-gladstone-hotel/"/>
   <updated>2012-03-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/when-the-rubber-hit-the-road-at-the-gladstone-hotel</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8947/when-the-rubber-hit-the-road-at-the-gladstone-hotel/attachment/screen-shot-2012-03-30-at-4-36-28-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-8948&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8948&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2012-03-30 at 4.36.28 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-shot-2012-03-30-at-4.36.28-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;595&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was working at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gladstonehotel.com/hotel&quot;&gt;Gladstone Hotel &lt;/a&gt;café on Tuesday, when an older, slightly disheveled man walked in with an elastic band around his head. When the waitress kindly asked him the reason for the elastic band (it was clear they knew each other) he replied it was there to keep his &amp;#8220;thoughts together.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the obvious humor of the moment, I gradually realized that the man was clearly dealing with mental illness. Even though some of his behaviour was quite strange and distracting, the waitress poured him a (free) cup of coffee and invited him to sit and stay at the bar for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gladstone Hotel is different than &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedrakehotel.ca/&quot;&gt;the other boutique hotel down the street &lt;/a&gt;because the Gladstone has a social mission. As they say on their website (which Hypenotic designed by the way):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than a hotel,The Gladstone is a social and cultural incubator facilitating sustainable and accessible ways of experiencing art, culture, community, and local cuisine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what I call a &amp;#8220;rubber hits the road&amp;#8221; moment and I was proud to be a patron at the Gladstone&amp;#8217;s café. Yes, some of the man&amp;#8217;s behaviours made me uncomfortable, but I was happy to get past my own discomfort and have him be a patron at the café with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s face it, the prospect of causing discomfort would have caused many other places to briskly whisk the man out. And, the idea of discomfort, our own or others&amp;#8217;, often governs our decisions. It&amp;#8217;s not wrong to consider how decisions like these will impact those who are connect to our business. But what happens when you compromise your values, and those of your business, to avoid discomfort or inconvenience?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It got me thinking about other &amp;#8220;rubber hits the road&amp;#8221; moments and whether we take the opportunity to live our values even when that decision is uncomfortable for us or our clients, partners, etc. Here are some questions I started thinking about when contemplating this issue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Would I  donate to the good causes I support even if it was a slow year for business?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Would I hire an employee if doing so required me to invest in expensive accommodations to make the workplace accessible?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  On a smaller level, would I buy &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8653/is-this-really-the-way-to-do-business&quot;&gt;the more expensive recycled printer paper&lt;/a&gt; at Staples, even though no one would ever know the difference?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Would I turn down lucrative work that I felt compromised my company&amp;#8217;s values, even though the &amp;#8216;compromise&amp;#8217; may not seem obvious to employees or the outside world?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These aren&amp;#8217;t easy questions, or easy moments. Other than our good guts, the other measure we use is our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bcorporation.net/hypenotic&quot;&gt;B Corp Certification&lt;/a&gt; which actually ensures we keep tabs on the  impact our business has on the environment, the community and our employees. We also know lots of ethical people we can consult in sticky situations. We&amp;#8217;re far from perfect. But I&amp;#8217;m comforted knowing we&amp;#8217;re on a path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m wondering about your &amp;#8220;rubber hits the road&amp;#8221; moments and what tools or resources you use to navigate through &amp;#8220;rubber hits the road&amp;#8221; decisions? Is it religion, a saying or a book? I&amp;#8217;d love to hear it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2012-03-28T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/ontario-lakes-project-black-lake</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8929/ontario-lakes-project-black-lake/attachment/black-dog-lake2&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-8940&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8940&quot; title=&quot;black-dog-lake2&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/black-dog-lake2-580x386.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;386&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Monkey Primavera. Sounds like a very strange Italian pasta dish you might get on the kids&amp;#8217; menu at Olive Garden.  But according to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haliburtonecho.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=847779&amp;amp;archive=true&quot;&gt;Haliburton Echo&lt;/a&gt;, it is the name of an eight month old hound puppy who went missing near Haliburton&amp;#8217;s Black Lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The puppy was the subject of a long and arduous community-wide search that included Black Lake and surrounding area. When two weeks past, Monkey&amp;#8217;s owner Phil and friends were certain Monkey was doomed. But on December 5, 2007, 18 long days after Monkey had disappeared news that the puppy had been found came over the Citizens Band radio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A trail groomer had found Monkey and lured him home with his trailer and &amp;#8220;a few pepperettes&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dog was eight pounds lighter and afraid of humans. But after being returned to his owner was immediately on the mend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monkey&amp;#8217;s owner put it this way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too often one does not get a second chance with those they lose. If a small, starved puppy can manage a kiss, I’m sure we all can do much more than that for those we love.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Retailer Says &#8216;Stop Shopping.&#8217;</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/are-they-crazy-patagonia-says-stop-buying-stuff/"/>
   <updated>2012-03-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/are-they-crazy-patagonia-says-stop-buying-stuff</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With the weather changing I&amp;#8217;m suddenly hyper aware of all of the new bright spring clothes jaunting up and down the sidewalk. Bright pink skinny belts and matching loafers and the like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the clothes are optimistic, I can&amp;#8217;t help letting a gnawing cynicism creep in. There&amp;#8217;s no doubt that a lot of the garb I&amp;#8217;m seeing comes from stores like H&amp;amp;M and Urban Outfitters&amp;#8211;stores that sell trendiness at high volumes and at the lowest possible cost. These are clothes with a miniscule life cycle&amp;#8211;built to not last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you own a Patagonia spring jacket or fleece, chances are you&amp;#8217;ve had it or plan to hold onto it for a while. Still, there&amp;#8217;s an inherent irony built into a store that promotes engaging with the outdoors and nature and, at the end of the day, encourages folks to buy more stuff that consumes energy and ruins that natural world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently Patagonia looked this contradiction straight in the eye and found the courage to address it. Patagonia took&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.patagonia.com/us/common-threads/#&quot;&gt; a bold move&lt;/a&gt; by asking customers to buy less and extend the lifecycle of their products for as long as possible in order to &amp;#8220;own up to all the harm we do and do our best to put an end to it.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/branding/8904/are-they-crazy-patagonia-says-stop-buying-stuff/attachment/screen-shot-2012-03-22-at-3-46-12-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-8907&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Screen shot 2012-03-22 at 3.46.12 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-shot-2012-03-22-at-3.46.12-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;390&quot; height=&quot;494&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patagonia courageously calls for &amp;#8220;a new economy&amp;#8221; which is focused on reducing overall consumption of things we don&amp;#8217;t need&amp;#8211;their products included. CEO Rick Ridgeway puts it this way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental assumption that we can continue on a growth economy is flawed in the long term. We need to start talking about what we are going to do about it.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporate philanthropy is usually about providing feel-good bandaid solutions to systemic problems. It&amp;#8217;s rare for a manufacturer/retailer to question fundamental, underpinning systems as big as capitalism. But, like us &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bcorporation.net/index.cfm/nodeID/F432CEBC-6C80-4F75-B1B6-0E7C1E7451F2/fuseaction/content.page&quot;&gt;Patagonia is a B Corp&lt;/a&gt;, so questioning how things are done is in their DNA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while they&amp;#8217;re helping reimagine Capitalism, they&amp;#8217;re taking steps to make sure they&amp;#8217;re doing what they can to limit impact their clothes have on the environment. Patagonia has taken the following steps on their mission:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  They offer to repair any ripped or damaged clothes for a small fee on 10 day turn around&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  They help you sell your used Patagonia clothes via their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.patagonia.com/us/ebay/used-gear&quot;&gt;branded Ebay Channel&lt;/a&gt; and their own &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.patagonia.com/us/ebay/used-gear&quot;&gt;used clothing store&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  They provide links to resources that make the case for reducing consumption like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.storyofstuff.org/&quot;&gt;The Story of Stuff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Offers a detailed care guide to empower customers to make their Patagonia stuff last a long, long time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  Here&amp;#8217;s a video manifesto they put together calling for a different kind of economy.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you manage to buy less? Do you think Patagonia is being hypocritical?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Building Businesses That Stand For Something</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/building-businesses-that-stand-for-something/"/>
   <updated>2012-03-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/building-businesses-that-stand-for-something</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Read a great article this morning by &lt;a title=&quot;About Chuck Templeton&quot; href=&quot;http://www.fastcoexist.com/users/chuck-templeton&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chuck Templeton&lt;/a&gt; that sums up the benefits of doing business ethically/sustainably, including a better long-term bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to comment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article expresses why part of me cringes when people bring up CSR. It&amp;#8217;s typically practiced as a band-aid solution to an issue AND as a marketing strategy. It does a diservice to both. It just doesn&amp;#8217;t wash to try to distract people from margins created unsustainably/unethically by doing good somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge for many is that they&amp;#8217;ve been taught to hide the negative side of their business for so long that they have trouble fathoming the benefits of addressing their issues publicly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For others, there are legitimate hurdles like laws that demand quarterly shareholder growth and a lack of business instruments for making choices that offer social impact in the short term and financial returns in the long. For these situations, and archaic legislation that prevents charitable organizations from making a profit while doing good, there&amp;#8217;s a &lt;a title=&quot;Mobilizing Private Capital for Public Good: Canadian Task force on Social Finance&quot; href=&quot;http://www.marsdd.com/dmsassets/reports/socialfinance_taskforcereport_2010.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;task force&lt;/a&gt; working on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short. If you knew that improving your practices or your industry publicly could be your markting and could build towards a healthier bottom line, would you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s holding you back?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Come meet people doing well by doing good: bcorp + prospective bcorp mixer</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/8843/"/>
   <updated>2012-03-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/8843</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m getting more and more questions about BCorp.&lt;br&gt;
Instead of answering the basics through email, I thought I&amp;#8217;d post a bit about why we&amp;#8217;re certified and invite you to an event that&amp;#8217;s happening this week where you can learn more about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe the best way to start is to answer why Hypenotic became a BCorp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I realize we don&amp;#8217;t have legislation to support our commitment to running a purpose driven business in Ontario. Yet. My hope is that when enough corporations make the symbolic commitment, it will put pressure on lawmakers to create provisions for us. That&amp;#8217;s why we&amp;#8217;re putting in extra effort to help BCorp grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until then, the certification offers several direct benefits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; We were doing business ethically already, so it&amp;#8217;s nice to be recognized for it. We love gold stars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; As it turns out, we&amp;#8217;re not perfect, and our scorecard gives us insight into where we can improve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; There are now over 500 BCorps in Canada and the US, 7 states that recognize it and 5 more in the pipeline. We&amp;#8217;d prefer to both get business from and give business to these kinds of enterprises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certification also has several indirect benefits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; We&amp;#8217;ve already received work from the kind of clients we like in part due to our certification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; This morning I presented to a dream arts/community based client after making it to the second round of proposals. They cited two reasons for inviting us: A previous project they like, and upon digging into us, our Bcorp certification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see many indications that unsustainable business practices are being recognized for what they are, including a financial crisis dominoing across Europe and the US&amp;#8217; housing collapse in 2007/8. I truly believe that businesses will increasingly require proof at minimum of ethical practices, but more likely evidence that how they make their margins actually brings value to others as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were already observing many of the certification tenets, but this year we&amp;#8217;re putting one person in charge of shepherding us to better grades. We can only improve in some areas, but we like the idea of a roadmap, so we&amp;#8217;re glad to have them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re incorporated (big or small), and would like to meet corporate leaders of purpose driven businesses, then we&amp;#8217;ve got a party for you. It&amp;#8217;s Happening Wednesday at fellow Bcorp Patagonia&amp;#8217;s swell space down the street on King West and is co-hosted by Bcorp and The Natural Step Canada. We&amp;#8217;re each supposed to bring a prospective Bcorp. Will you come?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My Toronto</title>

   <updated>2012-03-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/my-toronto</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_8846&quot; style=&quot;width: 590px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8845/my-toronto/attachment/toronto-zoo&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-8846&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-8846&quot; title=&quot;Toronto ZOO&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Toronto-ZOO-580x348.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;348&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    by Dusan Petricic
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a Mexican in Toronto sometimes I feel like I have a double personality. While I’m a native of Mexico City (or Chilanga as we call ourselves) I take a temporary Torontonian identity to be able to blend in and become a resident of this city. I know I’m not the only one and that’s one of the things that fascinate me about Toronto. People from all over the world come here taking an alternative identity that allows them to share a common ground and live together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day a friend of mine from Colombia showed me a book by illustrator Dusan Petricic called &lt;em&gt;My Toronto&lt;/em&gt;. Petricic was a political cartoonist in Belgrade who moved to Toronto in the early 90’s. Chances are you have  seen his work on *The Toronto Star *on in one of the many children’s books he has illustrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What really called my attention about &lt;em&gt;My Toronto&lt;/em&gt;, was the way in which Petricic’s illustrations show an intimate view of a city that is hard to define in words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_8847&quot; style=&quot;width: 590px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8845/my-toronto/attachment/lake-view&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-8847&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-8847&quot; title=&quot;Lake View&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/lake-view-580x361.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;361&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    Dusan Petricic
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With his humorist style, Petricic captures the spirit of a city in which newcomers are becoming locals and locals are always under the influence of newcomers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_8848&quot; style=&quot;width: 590px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8845/my-toronto/attachment/torontonians-copy&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-8848&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-8848&quot; title=&quot;Torontonians&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Torontonians-copy-580x431.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;431&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    by Dusan Petricic
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also shows a city that keeps transforming right in front of the eyes of the locals, or at least of those who have lived here long enough to witness it’s growth and expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_8849&quot; style=&quot;width: 590px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8845/my-toronto/attachment/toronto-skyscrapers-copy&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-8849&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-8849 &quot; title=&quot;Toronto Skyscrapers by Dusan Pet&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Toronto-Skyscrapers-copy-580x431.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;431&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    Toronto&#39;s Skyscrapers by Dusan Petrici
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find the interdependent relationship we have with the cities we live in extremely interesting and I certainly loved the way in which Perticic communicates our relationship with Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a city makes us who we are, I think I might be turning little by little into a Torontonian kind of Chilanga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about you, what kind of Torontonian are you?&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://getpoole.com/why-your-newsletter-sucks-two</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/47643206@N00/711658920&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured alignleft&quot; title=&quot;Headline News&quot; alt=&quot;Headline News&quot; src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1245/711658920_4b0ba3f41d_m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;160&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8384/why-your-emails-suck-how-to-grab-me-by-the-eyeballs&quot; title=&quot;Why your emails suck&quot;&gt;my recent post&lt;/a&gt; about fixing your email headline to get me to actually read it, I promised to show you how to test your headlines against your current ones that may be getting stale. And I&amp;#8217;ll do that shortly.&lt;br&gt;
But first, that post garnered some interesting responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two people thought the example headline I gave sounded spammy and they&amp;#8217;d unsubscribe if they got an email with that headline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least one commenter actually DID unsubscribe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the notion of personalizing your headlines ill considered?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curious to know, I did some cursory research to see whether anyone had stats on this. Results were quite divergent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eloqua.com/&quot; title=&quot;Eloqua&quot;&gt;One provider&lt;/a&gt; said that personalization &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.eloqua.com/chart-emai-open-rates/&quot; title=&quot;How personalization increases open rates&quot;&gt;improved open rates&lt;/a&gt; on a sample of 202 million emails. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mailermailer.com/&quot; title=&quot;Mailer Mailer&quot;&gt;Another&lt;/a&gt; said both &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mailermailer.com/resources/metrics/2011/personalization.rwp&quot; title=&quot;How personalization affects open rates&quot;&gt;open and click rates suffered&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seems the practice is hotly contested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming from some marketers (especially, um, spammers) personalizing a headline likely would seem spammy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I suspect that whether or not it does hinges on the relationship you have with your list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the record, I wasn&amp;#8217;t suggesting that every email you send out should be personalized. But rather that if you don&amp;#8217;t want your email to blend into the background noise in my inbox, for heaven&amp;#8217;s sake grab me with your headlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One MailChimp post suggests that the best subject line is one that mirrors &lt;a href=&quot;http://kb.mailchimp.com/article/how-do-i-know-if-im-writing-a-good-subject-line&quot; title=&quot;How do I know if I&amp;#39;m writing a good headline?&quot;&gt;your audience&amp;#8217;s expectations&lt;/a&gt;. That different subject lines apply to newsletters than special offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do you know what kinds of headlines will resonate with your list? Start split testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re not familiar with the term, split- or A/B- testing refers to sending different versions of your email to different segments of your list and measuring the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally to start you&amp;#8217;ll want to keep the variables to a minimum. For example, send the same email to two segments each with a different headline and see which one gets the best response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since many of our clients use MailChimp (as we do), here&amp;#8217;s a link to an &lt;a href=&quot;http://mailchimp.com/features/ab-split-testing/&quot; title=&quot;Split testing on MailChimp&quot;&gt;overview of the split testing features&lt;/a&gt; on Mailchimp . Be sure to watch the video as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mailchimp.com/features/ab-split-testing/&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-8774&quot; title=&quot;mailchimp-ab-test-movie&quot; alt=&quot;MailChimp split test movie&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/mailchimp-ab-test-movie.jpg&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;298&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week we put out the call for someone (anyone) to help us find something interesting about Big Kirkie Lake. We&amp;#8217;ve selected our winner. David Kruger is a dedicated Beau&amp;#8217;s Beer fan, so he took the time to put pen to paper in hopes of winning a case of &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/branding/7211/the-barry-beaus-beer-prototype-has-arrived&quot;&gt;Beau&amp;#8217;s beer with Barry&amp;#8217;s face on it.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is his winning submission which we based this week&amp;#8217;s Big Yirkie Lake logo on. Congrats David.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you looking for an interesting lake with lots of people watching,&lt;br&gt;
in eastern Ontario?  Don&amp;#8217;t go to Big Yirkie Lake.  Are you looking for&lt;br&gt;
a big lake with lots of party boats, in eastern Ontario?  Don&amp;#8217;t go to&lt;br&gt;
Big Yirkie Lake.  But, if you&amp;#8217;re looking for a wee little slice of&lt;br&gt;
Canadiana, Big Yirkie Lake is right for you.  You can fish for pike,&lt;br&gt;
bass, pickerel or perch, and even paddle down to Little Yirkie Lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
   Thanks David. You rock!
&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>3 Ways Hockey Stops Climate Change</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/3-ways-hockey-stops-climate-change/"/>
   <updated>2012-03-07T00:00:00-05:00</updated>

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &amp;#8220;Everybody Talks About the Weather, But Nobody Does Anything About It&amp;#8221; –&lt;em&gt;Mark Twain&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8749/3-ways-hockey-stops-climate-change/attachment/screen-shot-2012-03-07-at-4-06-33-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-8750&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-8750&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2012-03-07 at 4.06.33 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-shot-2012-03-07-at-4.06.33-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;426&quot; height=&quot;261&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue of climate change poses a number of serious marketing challenges: It&amp;#8217;s complicated, it&amp;#8217;s scary, it&amp;#8217;s abstract. This leads many to look the other way, or worse, throw on a light jacket and talk about what an &amp;#8220;amazing day&amp;#8221; it is in the middle of January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, an article in the Toronto Star titled &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestar.com/sports/hockey/juniorhockey/article/1140077--death-of-backyard-rinks-linked-to-climate-change&quot;&gt;Death of Backyard Rinks Linked to Climate Change&lt;/a&gt; demonstrated how to market climate change and make it immediate, concrete and relevant. The key is speaking to communities of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers have determined that climate change will bring on a &amp;#8220;significant shortening of the outdoor hockey season&amp;#8221; in Canada. By highlighting this particular fact, this research became relevant to hockey lovers who cherish this national past time. For these (largely) guys the prospect of there being no more Wayne Gretskys–all within four decades&amp;#8211; is unimaginable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researcher targeted specific communities of interest, and in so doing made the information matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the key will be to find ways to create deeper engagement among these Canadian Hockey lovers so that the connection between outdoor hockey and climate change is deeply ingrained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some suggestions for how I could see environmental organizations working together to leverage the power of hockey lovers to tackle climate change:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  There&amp;#8217;s the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wohc.ca/&quot;&gt;World Outdoor Hockey Tournament&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uspondhockey.com/&quot;&gt;US Pond Hockey Tournament &lt;/a&gt; and many others. Every year hockey-freaks gather at these events to celebrate playing the game (again quoting from the US Pond Hockey site) &amp;#8220;the way nature intended.&amp;#8221; Environmental groups have an opportunity to tap into the sense of nostalgia, manliness and connection to nature that truly resonates for these players. Hey &lt;a href=&quot;http://environmentaldefence.ca/&quot;&gt;Environmental Defence&lt;/a&gt;, form a team, set up a booth, interview the players about climate change and share the video, tweet from the event and set up a facebook group to Save Outdoor Hockey Rinks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Start an Outdoor Hockey Tournament Fundraiser. There&amp;#8217;s the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scotiabankproam.com/toronto/index.shtml&quot;&gt;Pro Am Skate for Alzheimers&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s an established model, but doing this in connection to climate change on an outdoor rink makes tons of sense. Hey&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sierraclub.ca/&quot;&gt; Sierra Club&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#8217;m talking to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Sell outdoor rink kits as a social enterprise venture. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.notfarfromthetree.org/archives/2157&quot;&gt;Not Far From the Tree sold maple syrup kits&lt;/a&gt; for $50 because it was connected to their mission. Well guess what environmental groups? Now outdoor rinks are connected to yours. And these kits are in high demand as dads everywhere do their best to build rinks in an ever warming climate. And hey, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidsuzuki.org/&quot;&gt;David Suzuki Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, make sure they&amp;#8217;re made out of recycled materials.&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Smart Car Leads Conversation about The Future of Cities</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/smart-car-leads-conversation-about-the-future-of-cities/"/>
   <updated>2012-03-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/smart-car-leads-conversation-about-the-future-of-cities</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8699/smart-car-leads-conversation-about-the-future-of-cities/attachment/screen-shot-2012-03-02-at-3-07-08-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-8704&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-8704&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2012-03-02 at 3.07.08 PM&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-shot-2012-03-02-at-3.07.08-PM.png&quot; width=&quot;464&quot; height=&quot;389&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Smart Car isn&amp;#8217;t just a car&amp;#8211;it&amp;#8217;s an idea. Sure, sure. Heard it all before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every car company will tell you that &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; car isn&amp;#8217;t just a car. Landrover is the possibility of the open road; BMW is design and performance embodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course no one&amp;#8217;s convinced that a Landrover &amp;amp; BMW aren&amp;#8217;t really just cars&amp;#8211;cars that do cool stuff, cars that make you feel powerful/authentic/hip/successful but cars nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smart-urban-stage.com/smart-urban-stage/&quot;&gt;Smart Urban Stage&lt;/a&gt; project is a world apart. This campaign demonstrates that Smart is indeed a smart car company that is thinking outside the box with four doors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Smart Urban Stage project asks experts from around the world to reflect on cities and what they call the &amp;#8220;Urban Status Quo.&amp;#8221; They create a forum where intellectuals from various disciplines can ask luminaries in their fields to respond to questions about the future of urban life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example is  trend forecaster Lidewij Edelkoort&amp;#8217;s question about Nationalism. She asks &amp;#8220;How Can We Come Together?&amp;#8221; and invites food stylists and artists to respond. The responses are fascinating but also provide a platform for global artists and intellectuals to profile their work to new audiences.  I also happen to know that Smart remunerates all of the participants for their contributions. Smart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my reflections of why the Smart Urban Stage project goes further on helping Smart be more than a car:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The campaign is about creating dialogue: Rather than Smart telling you what it thinks about the future of cities it opens the question up to a diverse range of intellectuals, artists and thinkers who do the heavy lifting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  It positions Smart as a leader. This is an issue that Smart Cars are linked to because smaller cars open up whole new ways of thinking about the urban landscape and about design&amp;#8217;s role in constructing a better future. But, it&amp;#8217;s not a direct link. And, Smart&amp;#8217;s role, while not hidden, is appropriately balanced in relation to other content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  It&amp;#8217;s actually interesting. So often initiatives like this sound interesting in boardrooms but can&amp;#8217;t really compete with all the other cool shit on the web. Fact is, this one can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you think this is just another clever car campaign in disguise? Or is this more interesting? Would you participate if they asked you (BTW, I know someone who has been invited to participate and she&amp;#8217;s taking these questions very seriously)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Keep Calm and Meme On</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/keep-calm-and-meme-on/"/>
   <updated>2012-03-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/keep-calm-and-meme-on</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You can love them or hate them but one thing is for sure, memes travel at the speed of light invading our Facebook walls and Twitter timelines until the point of exhaustion. What is it about them that makes people keep posting them and sharing them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition of Meme according to Webster dictionary is &amp;#8220;an idea, behavior or style that spreads from person to person within a culture.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking on Jodi&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8677/how-say-anything-helped-me-say-something&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; this week about how movies can help us articulate thoughts, I think Internet memes have a similar function. They are an ultra condensed statement about our opinions with a touch of irony and satire. But their real strength also comes with repetition; we have seen so many of them that they have become a common language in online culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my top 4 examples of memes that have recently brought us together (or torn us apart?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. “What society thinks I do” …&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buzzfeed.com/babymantis/how-people-see-me-is-older-than-you-think-1opu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;buzzfeed&lt;/a&gt; before these meme flooded our Facebook walls with examples of every career imaginable, it appeared on the Wellesley College yearbook in 1909 and it showed how the world viewed women scholars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8711/keep-calm-and-meme-on/attachment/wellesley&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-8713&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-8713&quot; title=&quot;wellesley&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/wellesley-580x604.jpg&quot; width=&quot;348&quot; height=&quot;362&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite example: Stormtrooper!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8711/keep-calm-and-meme-on/attachment/what-i-do-meme-stormtrooper&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-8727&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8727&quot; title=&quot;what-i-do-meme-stormtrooper&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/what-i-do-meme-stormtrooper-580x457.jpg&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;457&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Sh*t People Say&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with the video &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/u-yLGIH7W9Y&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Shit Girls Say&lt;/a&gt; (15 million views on YouTube), posted only two months ago, we&amp;#8217;ve heard what almost everyone has to say!&lt;br&gt;
My favourite so far: Sh*t nobody says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Y U No Guy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s the all time #1 most popular character in &lt;a href=&quot;http://memegenerator.net/instance/15224346?urlName=Y-U-No&amp;browsingOrder=Popular&amp;browsingTimeSpan=Week&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;memegenerator.net&lt;/a&gt; with 776,097 different combinations of the formula: “(subject noun), [WH]Y [YO]U NO (verb)?”.&lt;br&gt;
Apparently the original face comes from a Japanese sci-fi manga / anime series called &lt;a title=&quot;Know Your Meme&quot; href=&quot;http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/y-u-no-guy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gantz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8711/keep-calm-and-meme-on/attachment/y-u-no&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-8720&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-8720&quot; title=&quot;y u no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/y-u-no.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Keep Calm and Carry On&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was originally a poster produced by the British government in 1939 to raise the morale of the British people during Second World War. It was not very well known until the year 2000 when it was reissued and used as a decorative theme for products.&lt;br&gt;
Check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keepcalm-o-matic.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Keep Calm O- Matic&lt;/a&gt;, a website where you can make your own customizable poster and then share it and have people vote for them. Although for guaranteed results once you&amp;#8217;re done with your meme just post it on &lt;a href=&quot;http://pinterest.com/maryelf/keep-calm-and-carry-on/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pinterest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8711/keep-calm-and-meme-on/attachment/calm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-8712&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8712&quot; title=&quot;Keep Calm and Meme On&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/calm-580x676.jpg&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;676&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So tell us, what’s your favorite meme and what does it say about you?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How Say Anything Helped Me Say Something</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/how-say-anything-helped-me-say-something/"/>
   <updated>2012-02-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/how-say-anything-helped-me-say-something</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8677/how-say-anything-helped-me-say-something/attachment/screen-shot-2012-02-28-at-2-37-58-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-8679&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-8679&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2012-02-28 at 2.37.58 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Screen-shot-2012-02-28-at-2.37.58-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;514&quot; height=&quot;324&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Hypenotic we spend a lot of time helping clients succinctly define what they do in a way that is useful and relevant to others. We call it a brand mantra and it answers the question &amp;#8220;What needle are you moving in the world?&amp;#8221; We know it&amp;#8217;s empowering and uplifting to be able to say what you&amp;#8217;re really trying to do through your work in a few powerful words or sentences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just had a reminder in just how good it feels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I was telling a friend about my decision to go back to school part time for Career Counselling. I was struggling to describe how a career counselling practice will connect to Hypenotic&amp;#8217;s work with values based clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, in a few years from now, I plan start a branch of Hypenotic that will focus on counselling people looking for values based careers. Not sure you&amp;#8217;re clear? Well thanks to my cinephile friend Mira and the character Lloyd Dobler things are about to get much clearer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was describing my vision for a Career Counselling practice my pal Mira paused and said: &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t want to sell anything, buy anything, or process anything&amp;#8230;you know, as a career.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a faint recollection of where this brilliant quote came from but it took a few moments to connect it back to the 1989 film &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098258/&quot;&gt;Say Anything&lt;/a&gt; and Lloyd Dobler&amp;#8217;s description of his career goals. Check this out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to get my first real career break when I told a career counsellor &amp;#8220;I think I want to be in advertising, but I don&amp;#8217;t want to sell shampoo.&amp;#8221; Of course what I said isn&amp;#8217;t nearly as articulate as Lloyd Dobler&amp;#8217;s expression of existential angst over a life spent selling (buying, processing or repairing) stuff, but it was the best I could do at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the outside it can seem difficult if not impossible to find a career that isn&amp;#8217;t attached to buying, selling,  processing or repairing anything bought, sold or processed. But now that I&amp;#8217;m closer to the inside I know a ton of people who do just that&amp;#8211;they use food to revolutionize city building (&lt;a href=&quot;http://wx.toronto.ca/inter/health/food.nsf&quot;&gt;Toronto Food Strategy&lt;/a&gt;), they build capacity for social innovation (&lt;a href=&quot;http://socialfinance.ca/about/partners/sigmars&quot;&gt;MaRs Centre for Impact Investing&lt;/a&gt;), they help new immigrants get what they really need to ease their transition to a new country (&lt;a href=&quot;http://canadianimmigrant.ca/&quot;&gt;Canadian Immigrant&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say Anything&amp;#8217;s helped me Say Something. And I&amp;#8217;m jazzed. Now I&amp;#8217;m wondering: Are there movies that have helped you articulate something about your business or yourself that you were struggling to put into words?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Here&amp;#8217;s an amazing little hack called &lt;a href=&quot;http://lloydtube.com/&quot;&gt;LloydTube&lt;/a&gt; where you can make any song come out of Lloyd&amp;#8217;s iconic boombox. I&amp;#8217;m in love!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;div style=&quot;width: 210px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hp_laserjet_4200dtns.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured&quot; title=&quot;English: An HP LaserJet 4200 dtns printer&quot; src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Hp_laserjet_4200dtns.jpg/300px-Hp_laserjet_4200dtns.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;English: An HP LaserJet 4200 dtns printer&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    Image via Wikipedia
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night I&amp;#8217;m at &lt;a class=&quot;zem_slink&quot; title=&quot;Staples Inc.&quot; href=&quot;http://www.staples.com/&quot; rel=&quot;homepage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Staples&lt;/a&gt; to pick up some paper for my &lt;a class=&quot;zem_slink&quot; title=&quot;Laser printer&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_printer&quot; rel=&quot;wikipedia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;laser printer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m overwhelmed by the choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is laser printer paper, inkjet paper, recycled paper, hi gloss paper, heavy weight paper, light utility paper, colored paper. And more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I settle on some recycled paper with the &lt;a class=&quot;zem_slink&quot; title=&quot;Forest Stewardship Council&quot; href=&quot;http://www.fsc.org/&quot; rel=&quot;homepage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FSC&lt;/a&gt; logo because, when I can, I want to do the right thing. I figure when the barriers are low there&amp;#8217;s no excuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when I get to the checkout the cashier asks me whether I wanted to take advantage of a 27% discount on still other paper I had failed to notice in the paper aisle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She says the paper is essentially the same. At first glance, it appears to be identical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same quantity, same weight, same brightness, same graphic design, same bullet points and starbursts on the packaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, of course I want a deal, but I can&amp;#8217;t help wondering what the difference is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cashier tells me this otherwise identical paper isn&amp;#8217;t recyclable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an extra buck-seventy-five, I figure I should do the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t help but be reminded what a crazy world we live in where we actually incentivize cutting corners and making poor choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I wonder&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there places where I don&amp;#8217;t do the right thing or the best thing for my clients because it costs too much (in time, money or effort)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If so, is this really the way to do business?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ontario Lakes Project: Big Trout Lake</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/ontario-lakes-project-big-trout-lake/"/>
   <updated>2012-02-24T00:00:00-05:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8572/ontario-lakes-project-big-trout-lake/attachment/big-trout&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-8595&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8595&quot; title=&quot;big-trout&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/big-trout-580x416.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Big Trout Lake, home of The Ugly One&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;416&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big Trout Lake is home to a lake monster called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omajinaakoos&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Omajinaakoos&lt;/a&gt;, or &amp;#8216;The Ugly One&amp;#8217;. And  according to the Kitchenuhmaykoosib Inninuwug First Nations legend he&amp;#8217;s an omen of bad luck. The most recent sighting of Omajinaakoos was in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestar.com/news/ontario/article/812580--update-the-ugly-one-monster-mystery&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;May of 2010&lt;/a&gt; when two Health Canada nurses stationed at the Kitchenuhmaykoosib Band reserve on Big Trout Lake went out for a walk with their dog and stumbled across an Omajinaakoos that had washed up on shore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Omajinaakoos are rumored to live in swamps and feed on beavers. When the monster was found it set off a major internet controversy and speculation as to what the Omajinaakoos actually was. It is believed most likely to be a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/292294&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hoax&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitaljournal.com/article/292321&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;opossum&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/ontario/big-trout-lake-monster-sparks-internet-debate/article1576748/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;otter&lt;/a&gt; or some kind of &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitaljournal.com/article/292321&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mink&lt;/a&gt;. What do you think? Is there a monster living in Big Trout Lake?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>5 Plugins to Better Your WordPress Development</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/5-plugins-to-better-your-wordpress-development/"/>
   <updated>2012-02-24T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/5-plugins-to-better-your-wordpress-development</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8296/5-plugins-to-better-your-wordpress-development/attachment/cleanup&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-8304&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-8304&quot; title=&quot;cleanup&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/cleanup.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone needs a hand or two when it comes to developing your own WordPress themes. These plugins can make that process a little easier whether it&amp;#8217;s by filling in missing functionality or by doing some sorely needed clean up in just a few clicks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-optimize&quot;&gt;1. WP Optimize&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every so often with all the wordpress updates and maintenance that your database becomes a little slow and messy. This plugin helps you to keep your database clean by removing post revisions and spams in a blaze. allows you to rename your admin name also. Additionally it allows you to run optimize command on your wordpress core tables (use with caution).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/velvet-blues-update-urls/&quot;&gt;2. Velvet Blues Update URLs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you move your site to another URL and all the images in your wordpress installation are broken? Well, this handy plugin does a quick URL replace. You can choose to replace urls in only page content, in attachements, as well as a variety of other options without you having to write any database queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-php-widget/&quot;&gt;3. WP PHP widget&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This plugin adds a new widget called PHP Widget, which will allow you to include PHP code, you can have Text, HTML, Javascript, Flash and/or PHP code wordpress template tags as content or title in this widget. So, as long as you want, it can do everything, that is greatful.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-pagenavi/&quot;&gt;4. WP Page Navi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paging system that comes with wordpress by default isn&amp;#8217;t very flexible. WP Page Navi provides &amp;#8220;a more advanced paging navigation interface&amp;#8221;. So you can easily replace &amp;#8220;Next Page →&amp;#8221; with a more intuitive page numbering system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;[5. Clean Options][5]&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s face it, we all install and uninstall tons of plugins in an attempt to come up with an amazing wordpress site. The unfortunate thing is that some plugins leave behind a bunch of junk inside your database tables. With this handy plugin you can clean up orphaned plugin data and free up some space!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[5]: Finds orphaned options and allows for their removal from the wp_options table.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>3 Ways we Improved our Newsletter</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/3-ways-we-improved-our-newsletter/"/>
   <updated>2012-02-24T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/3-ways-we-improved-our-newsletter</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At Hypenotic we are constantly testing new technologies, trending ideas and &amp;#8220;best practices.&amp;#8221; Our focus the last couple of weeks has been mobile newsletters. With the &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8423/exploding-growth-of-mobile-email-what-it-means-for-you&quot; title=&quot;Exploding Growth of Mobile Email: What it means for you.&quot;&gt;growth of mobile email&lt;/a&gt; and the discussion that surfaced based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8384/why-your-emails-suck-how-to-grab-me-by-the-eyeballs&quot; title=&quot;Why your newsletter sucks: How to grab me by the eyeballs&quot;&gt;why your newsletter sucks&lt;/a&gt;, we decided to rework our own newsletter to see what would happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By focusing on the subject line, the email content preview, the design and actions we were able to get a 3.2% increase in our open rate and a 1.1% increase in our click-throughs.  According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mailchimp.com&quot; title=&quot;Mailchimp&quot;&gt;Mailchimp&lt;/a&gt;, who is our newsletter service provider, we were ahead of the industry standard (&amp;#8220;creative services/agency&amp;#8221;) open rate by 1.3% and click-throughs by 2%. These stats really depend on what kind of email list you have. If it&amp;#8217;s a list of all your friends then you&amp;#8217;d probably have rates close to 100%, but if it&amp;#8217;s a large list of subscribers you may or may not know, the average click through rate is&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lyris.com/email-marketing/85-Average-Email-Click-Through-Rate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; 2% &amp;#8211; 15%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-8611&quot; title=&quot;opens-click-throughs&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/opens-click-throughs.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Newsletter click-throughs&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;186&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the changes we made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Subject line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subject lines are critical in newsletters. It can influence whether someone opens the message, hits delete or ends up in your spam folder. It&amp;#8217;s a fine balance of being business like and peaking interest.  We changed our subject line from &amp;#8220;Latest News for 02/12/2012&amp;#8243; to &amp;#8220;Latest News: Weekly Roundup.&amp;#8221; Granted, not a huge change but one that moved from a computer generated date to proper language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Email preview content&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The email content preview of the email is the one or two lines that you see before you open the message. It depends on your email client and setup. In my case I get about 30 -40 words of content preview. We moved from what I can only describe as a mishmash of content (see before image ) to one that consisted of a summary of what was in the email. We still have some tailoring to do with this but you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-8613&quot; title=&quot;newsletter-before&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/newsletter-before.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;578&quot; height=&quot;88&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-8614&quot; title=&quot;newsletter-after&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/newsletter-after.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;578&quot; height=&quot;88&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Design and Actions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made some major changes here that really drove click throughs. Your newsletter is really like a website landing page and you should incorporate the same practices. Clear, concise with one or two actions. We made the &amp;#8220;read more&amp;#8221; button shiny and big. We took out the date, the author name and all the share and &amp;#8220;send to a friend&amp;#8221; buttons. After all, are they really that useful? I don&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;ve ever used a &amp;#8220;send to a friend&amp;#8221; button from my iPhone and I usually &amp;#8220;Tweet&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;Like&amp;#8221; from an article webpage not from a newsletter. We also made the text larger with more breathing room and white space.  The result was less &amp;#8220;stuff&amp;#8221;, clean and with a single action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;****&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-8615&quot; title=&quot;newsletterdesign1&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/newsletterdesign1.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;218&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-8616&quot; title=&quot;newletterdesign2&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/newletterdesign2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;256&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what&amp;#8217;s next on our list. Well, next week we are going responsive. What does that mean? Basically, we are going to tailor the newsletter to the device. If you&amp;#8217;re viewing the newsletter on a desktop you will see one design and content flow and if you&amp;#8217;re seeing it on your mobile you&amp;#8217;ll see something that suits the mobile experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us know what you are doing with your newsletter and stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Sorry, blatant call to action here, if you want to sign up for our newsletter it&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/newsletter-subscription&quot;&gt;pretty easy to do&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Is Pinterest the next big thing?</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/is-pinterest-the-next-big-thing/"/>
   <updated>2012-02-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/is-pinterest-the-next-big-thing</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8580/is-pinterest-the-next-big-thing/attachment/pinterest-2&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-8581&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8581&quot; title=&quot;pinterest&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/pinterest-580x442.png&quot; alt=&quot;the next big thing&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;442&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are already a Pinterest user I bet your email has been recently flooded by notifications of pins, repinns and follows. I have been a user for about a year and I had never seen such action until now. It seems like this social media site has finally gone mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned Pinterest in a blogpost some months ago, as one place you could go to &lt;a title=&quot;where to find inspiration online&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/6823/where-to-find-inspiration-online&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;find inspiration online&lt;/a&gt;. Back then I was using it to collect material that could serve as reference for my &lt;a href=&quot;http://angelykke.tumblr.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;album cover project&lt;/a&gt;, I had basically two boards: one about &lt;a title=&quot;album covers&quot; href=&quot;https://pinterest.com/angelykke/album-covers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;album covers&lt;/a&gt; and the other one about &lt;a title=&quot;rock stars&quot; href=&quot;https://pinterest.com/angelykke/rockstars/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rock stars&lt;/a&gt;. I was also following the boards of some designer friends (all women) who would post cool designs and cute pictures, that was all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday my coworker Lionel asked me how could he follow me on Pinterest and then it hit me… I realized that I had an audience, that I should start pinning more and that I should upload my own content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a better understanding on the whole phenomenon I decided to ask google:  Is pinterest the next big thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the things google told me and that you should probably take into consideration if you are not a Pinterest user yet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Pinterest is a virtual pinborard that lets you organize and share things you find on the web in an online community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Last month, Pinterest suddenly jumped from 1 million unique monthly visitors to 11 million.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Marketing companies have discovered that Pinterest redirects more traffic back to their websites than Google + and other social networks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Pinterest is not meant for self-promotion directly, however you can use it creatively to showcase the lifestyle or culture your brand promotes and share it with likeminded people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Pinterest has the option to connect to Twitter and Facebook so you can post new pins ubiquitously in all your accounts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  To join Pinterest you need to request an invitation. The easiest way to do it is to ask a friend who already has an account to invite you. (If else fails, let me know and I can invite you.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The majority of the users, up to now, are women and for this reason, there are lots of images about fashion, decoration, cooking and such. However, you are the one curating your boards so just like in twitter, you are the only one responsible for Justin Beaver pictures appearing in your board/timeline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  To prove that not everything in Pinterest are pictures of wedding invitations and kittens, there’s the “&lt;a href=&quot;http://pinterest.com/drewhawkins/board-of-man/&quot;&gt;The Board of Man&lt;/a&gt;” With 195,733 followers, this board is dedicated to “bring balance to the force”  with images of Star Wars, whiskey, Chuck Norris and lots of bacon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to read more about how to use Pinterest for business, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hubspot.com/how-to-use-pinterest-for-business/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;HubSpot&lt;/a&gt; has an awesome manual that explains why should you join, if not now, at least very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ontario Lakes Project: Big Rideau Lake</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/ontario-lakes-project-big-rideau-lake/"/>
   <updated>2012-02-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/ontario-lakes-project-big-rideau-lake</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/ontario-lakes-project/8509/ontario-lakes-project-big-rideau-lake/attachment/big-rideau&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-8551&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8551&quot; title=&quot;big-rideau&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/big-rideau-580x543.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;543&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Clear a Lake and They Will Come.&amp;#8221; Rick Mercer had it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big Rideau Lake is home to Skate the Lake, an annual speed skating marathon on a 1k outdoor oval rink in Portland Ontario. Skaters from around the world take part in the 25 km, 50 km, and various other races. It&amp;#8217;s also home to a curling competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event is so quintessentially Canadian that it&amp;#8217;s even been covered by Rick Mercer on the Rick Mercer Report. Watch Rick hitch himself to a Zamboni to get to the finish line.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Yoga and Work</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/yoga-and-work/"/>
   <updated>2012-02-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/yoga-and-work</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8513/yoga-and-work/attachment/yoga-angelica&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-8515&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-8515  aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;yoga-angelica&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/yoga-angelica-580x704.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; width=&quot;464&quot; height=&quot;563&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two or three times a week during lunchtime I go to yoga at a studio near my office. I have discovered that these days I come back to my computer feeling happier, refreshed and more motivated to be productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very hard to spend 8 straight hours producing work every day. And while not everyone may be able to take time in the middle of the day to workout, there are simple things you can do to help improve your experience in the workplace. Here are 4 things I learned from going to yoga and that I try to apply every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Change environment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Just to get out of the office is already a triumph. Try to schedule time outside to have some fresh air, walk around the block, or get a coffee or lunch somewhere new. I find that most of the time, stepping out brings new perspectives and inspiration to solve a problem faster than when I just stay inside . Getting out of the office for a while is well-invested time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Breathe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When was the last time you took one conscious breath? Lets try it now, one deep breath. Ready? Ok, start by inhaling slowly through your nose, feel all the air filling your lungs and expanding your diaphragm, hold for a second, now exhale as you try to empty all the air and let go of some of the tension in your shoulders. Feels good doesn’t it? Try it again. Like meditation, yoga helps to shift your focus from the constant dialogue happening in your head to what’s actually happening in your body through conscious breathing. After all, breathing correctly means getting more oxygen to your blood stream and oxygen gets you high (doesn’t it?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Move your body.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Think about how many hours have you been sitting down. Stand up, stretch your legs, put your arms up to liberate some of the tension in your column. Move your neck gently in circles a couple of times to each side. Do circles with all your joints: wrists, knees, ankles, and elbows. If you think it is awkward to do this in front of your coworkers go back to point number 1 and step out of the office to walk and stretch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Listen to your body.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sometimes I find myself sitting in very uncomfortable postures and only realize it once it starts hurting. Make a quick posture check once every hour or so bringing consciousnesses back to your body. Are you shrugging your shoulders? Are you carrying more weight on one side of your body? Try to distribute your weight equally on your sitting bones, try unclenching the jaw and relax your face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoga, as well as these simple exercises, tries to balance the attention between mind and body. Most of the time we give priority to the mind because it is the most practical tool we have to solve problems, especially at work. However the body thinks too, its thoughts are made of conscious movement and breath. Imagine what we could accomplish both inside and outside the workplace if we learn to think using our mind and body as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Later, Hypenotigators.</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/8482/"/>
   <updated>2012-02-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/8482</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It seems like forever ago that I first set foot in Hypenotic, a little third year student looking for a three-week internship. That short internship was extended into a part-time and then full-time job, and what I found was an amazing place to work and learn, with people who really love what they’re doing. But it’s time to spread my wings, hop out of the Hypenotic nest, and head out into the big scary world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-8483&quot; title=&quot;Bye Hypenotic!&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ByeHypenotic.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bye Hypenotic!&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to share a few tidbits on what it’s like to work at Hypenotic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;You know you work at Hypenotic when&amp;#8230;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  You’ve napped on the green couch, and had your picture taken while sleeping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The topic of coffee (cutting down on coffee/quitting coffee/coming back to coffee/how to make the best coffee) comes up often.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Your day is ruined by the words, “there’s no milk”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  You encourage each other to be healthy. Everyone is involved in some form of physical activity, be it yoga, biking, dog-walking, or afternoon dance parties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  You&amp;#8217;ve learned about some exciting new dance/exercise routines via live demonstrations from Jodi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  You know more about local sustainable food than you ever did before, and make much more of an effort to eat well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  It is almost expected that when you announce you are going for a walk, you should come back with some kind of treat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  You’re always too hot or too cold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  You find strange and mysterious objects in your desk&amp;#8230; like a surplus of flip-flops.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  You’ve worn the office hoodie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  You know what “B5” means. You may have ordered it many, many times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  “What’s everyone doing for lunch?” is something you hear a lot, as well as, “Can you just get me a B5?”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  You buy cupcakes for yourself on someone else’s birthday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  You get home and find a doggy poop bag in your pocket.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve learned so much here, and have enjoyed working with such wonderful people, but the time has come for me to move on to new adventures. I’ll miss you guys. I’ll miss the beautiful sunny office. I’ll miss the coffee. And Blue, I think I’ll miss you most of all. You stay cute, office puppy. Thanks for everything guys, I hope to see you all soon!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Exploding Growth of Mobile Email: What it means for you.</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/exploding-growth-of-mobile-email-what-it-means-for-you/"/>
   <updated>2012-02-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/exploding-growth-of-mobile-email-what-it-means-for-you</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Does anyone read email on their desktop anymore? According to the report by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.returnpath.net/blog/intheknow/2011/05/mobile-email-study-finds-81-growth-in-email-activity-on-mobile-ipad-tablet-viewership-increasing/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Return Path&lt;/a&gt;, there was an 81% growth in folks viewing email on their mobile device during a 6-month period last year. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://litmus.com/blog/email-client-market-share-infograph&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Litmus report&lt;/a&gt; released in September 2011 was even higher at 150% growth. Whatever the number, viewing email on mobile is rocketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;background-color: #eee1b2; border: 1px dotted #ccc;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p style=&quot;padding: 20px;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;UPDATE: February 11, 2012&lt;/strong&gt; ComScore released its annual &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Presentations_Whitepapers/2012/2012_US_Digital_Future_in_Focus&quot;&gt;US Digital Future in Focus&lt;/a&gt; report this week, offering a year-end wrap of  trends its tracked throughout the past year.  According to the report, web-based email use among 12-17 year olds dropped 31% in the past year, while use among those 18 to 24 saw an even bigger drop of 34%. Some of that can no doubt be attributed to Facebook and other email alternatives, but a big factor is the growth of email use on mobile devices; both of those age groups saw double-digit growth in that respect, with &lt;strong&gt;mobile email use jumping 32% among 18 to 24 year olds&lt;/strong&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this mean? Well, for marketers and content producers, if you aren&amp;#8217;t thinking about how your content is being viewed on a small screen then you&amp;#8217;re missing the boat. Don&amp;#8217;t worry, it&amp;#8217;s a pretty big boat. It&amp;#8217;s going to be holding a lot of people in 2012 and beyond. Justine Jordan, Marketing Director from Litmus writes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Email remains the strongest online activity around the globe. In fact, email users are expected to reach 3.8 billion by 2014. That is nearly half of the world&amp;#8217;s current population, and a significant climb from 2.9 billion reported users in 2010. Now that most are equipped with smartphones and ipads, is anyone still logging on to view their messages on a monitor?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The popular email marketing service, Campaign Monitor, released their 2011 report which saw an increase in mobile email usage on iPhone, iPad and Android from &amp;#8220;4% of the market to almost 20% in just two years.&amp;#8221; Using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/post/3495/the-rise-of-mobile-email/&quot;&gt;chart from Campaign Monitor&lt;/a&gt; and extending the time frame and general trend,  it could be around Spring 2013 when viewing email on mobile devices out numbers desktop and webmail clients.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/mobile-newsletters-chart.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-8432 &quot; title=&quot;mobile-newsletters-chart&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/mobile-newsletters-chart-580x316.jpg&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;316&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    Author&amp;#8217;s prediction based on Campaign Monitor Chart
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jarrod, a commenter on the article &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/post/3495/the-rise-of-mobile-email/&quot;&gt;The prolific rise of mobile email&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; nails it with this point:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I’m hoping to implement a mobile design later this month, or early July which is based on no data at all &amp;#8211; only industry statistics. If even a fraction of the above is true for our customer base, that can mean thousands of people are viewing our email in their mobile when it is not optimised for it.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For &lt;strong&gt;marketing and content producers&lt;/strong&gt; who are developing their email newsletters in-house or hiring an agency for the management, design or delivery it means:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Having a general understanding of how the user experience on each device is different and how it may influence the content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Being aware of where your enewsletter links click to? If they go to a non-optimized website that is not mobile friendly, what&amp;#8217;s the point. The user will not only move on but might even unsubscribe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Not marketing or producing in a bubble. Talk to the designer and developer and learn about what works and what doesn&amp;#8217;t in terms of email newsletter best practices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;strong&gt;web designer and/or developer&lt;/strong&gt; it means:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Learning about responsive design, media queries, best practices and how it impacts the user experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Knowing about device ergonomics and realizing some areas of the screen are easier to get to than others. This can really influence design and where you put action buttons or links.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Educate. This often gets overlooked by developers, but if you can educate your clients and the people around you in designing for mobile then half your job is done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to get in deeper there are a ton of resources but you can start with &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/08/18/from-monitor-to-mobile-optimizing-email-newsletters-with-css/&quot;&gt;From Monitor to Mobile: Optimizing Email Newsletters with CCS&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;http://stylecampaign.com/blog/2011/07/finger-snafu/&quot;&gt;Finger Snafu &amp;#8211; 10 frequent misfires when designing emails for touch&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are you doing to optimize your email newsletter for mobile?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ontario Lakes Project: Big Hawk Lake</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/ontario-lakes-project-big-hawk-lake/"/>
   <updated>2012-02-09T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/ontario-lakes-project-big-hawk-lake</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8414/ontario-lakes-project-big-hawk-lake/attachment/big-hawk&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-8418&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8418&quot; title=&quot;big-hawk&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/big-hawk-580x355.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;355&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;At Big Hawk Lake in the Haliburton Highlands you&amp;#8217;ll find the province&amp;#8217;s only remaining log chute. What is a log chute you ask? It&amp;#8217;s basically a huge waterslide made to carry logs over river landscapes and into lakes for delivery to a sawmill. At one time there were thousands of these log chutes, but alas, this last remaining from 1861 was rebuilt in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The log chute is a testament to the long history of logging in Ontario. Throughout the 1800s, thousands of men carried logs over turbulent river waters to be delivered to the sawmill via log chutes. Blogger &lt;a href=&quot;http://gracie-senseandsimplicity.blogspot.com/2011/10/log-chutes-and-family-links.html&quot;&gt;Grace and Simplicity&lt;/a&gt; gave an account of the log chute&amp;#8217;s use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In the 19th century logs were hewn into square timbers and then joined to make cribs, which were then attached together to make large rafts.   The lumbermen lived and worked on these rafts navigating them down the river to Quebec City and then by ship to Europe.  When they came to a rapids or falls, the rafts would be broken apart and sent down the log chutes in separate cribs.  The log chutes prevented the logs from being damaged while going over the falls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a way of life for a generation of Ontario men. And remaining evidence of this history lives on in the Haliburton Highlands. When you visit, be sure to check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stanhopemuseum.on.ca/&quot;&gt;Stanhope Museum&lt;/a&gt; which tells the chute&amp;#8217;s history in greater detail.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why your newsletter sucks: How to grab me by the eyeballs</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/why-your-emails-suck-how-to-grab-me-by-the-eyeballs/"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;div style=&quot;width: 250px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/41894177347@N01/3150724610&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;zemanta-img-inserted&quot; title=&quot;Hi everybody, headline goes here please&quot; alt=&quot;Hi everybody, headline goes here please&quot; src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3108/3150724610_e2b0f585e3_m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    Hi everybody, headline goes here please (Photo credit: reinvented)
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marketing&amp;#8217;s hard work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make it pay off, you need to make it worth paying attention to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take your email newsletter, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I get another email called &amp;#8220;XYZ Newsletter: February 2012&amp;#8243; I think I&amp;#8217;ll scream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, likely just hit &lt;em&gt;unsubscribe&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Point is, if you want me to read your emails, you&amp;#8217;ve gotta grab me by the eyeballs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare the headline below to the one above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rick, is this what you&amp;#8217;re looking for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See what I did there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using my favorite word (my name, natch), I got my attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I asked a question that shows I care about what matters to me. And one that&amp;#8217;s just begging for an answer, which I&amp;#8217;m sure I&amp;#8217;ll learn if I open the email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is just an example. The right headline to use will depend on the subject, what your audience cares about, and what you want them to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it should come in your own voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &amp;#8220;e-newsletter&amp;#8221; doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be all stiff and formal and official. It can just be a conversation between people. You&amp;#8217;re trying to build a relationship here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And please remember that your marketing isn&amp;#8217;t set in stone. It&amp;#8217;s a laboratory. Test and measure and you&amp;#8217;ll begin to see what people respond to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an upcoming email, I&amp;#8217;ll show you how to do that. It&amp;#8217;s easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, check out Copyblogger&amp;#8217;s reference on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.copyblogger.com/email-subject-lines/&quot; title=&quot;The Three Key Elements of Irresistible  Email Subject Lines&quot;&gt;writing irresistible email headlines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And tell me: What compelling headline has come into your inbox lately that grabbed you by the peepers (and got you to open the email)?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Rescue Dogs: A Trend Unleashed</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/rescue-dogs-a-trend-unleashed/"/>
   <updated>2012-02-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/rescue-dogs-a-trend-unleashed</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been meeting a lot of dogs lately. No surprise there (have you &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8112/welcome-to-the-team-blue&quot;&gt;met my new dog Blue?&lt;/a&gt;) But what is surprising is the number of people who I meet who tell me their dogs are &amp;#8220;rescues.&amp;#8221; Not familiar with the term rescue? Wikipedia defines a rescue dog as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;A dog that has been rescued from possible euthanasia after being found as a stray, a dog that has been saved from an abusive or neglectful home by an animal rescue organization&amp;#8230;.or a dog that is simply no longer wanted or can no longer be cared for by its owner&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a huge trend. So big in fact last night&amp;#8217;s Superbowl had a Bud Light ad featuring a rescue dog named &amp;#8220;weego.&amp;#8221; As the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/BudLight&quot;&gt;Bud Light facebook page &lt;/a&gt;explains, for every &amp;#8216;like&amp;#8217; Weego receives $1 will be donated to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/pages/Tony-La-Russas-Animal-Rescue-Foundation/47924244850&quot;&gt;Tony La Russa&amp;#8217;s Dog Rescue Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.  Listen, an issue doesn&amp;#8217;t get much mainstream than that!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out for a walk with my pooch this morning I met a woman who said her Basset Hound was a rescue. When pressed, she said she got him at the pound, but he was* about* to be sent to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bassetrescue.ca/&quot;&gt;Basset Hound Rescue.&lt;/a&gt; There seems to be some caché in claiming your pup&amp;#8217;s a rescue. So, I&amp;#8217;m wondering, what&amp;#8217;s behind it? Here are my thoughts;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Trend Toward Social Causes:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://dogslifemagazine.com/adoptionisthenewblack/&quot;&gt;Dog Life Magazine &lt;/a&gt;sees the rescue dog trend as part of a &amp;#8220;greater trend toward philanthropy and social causes.&amp;#8221; In fact, the Executive Director of one pet adoption website sees it as akin to recycling: “People go out of their way to recycle a can. Why wouldn’t you go to recycle a life out of a shelter?” Not sure I&amp;#8217;m feeling the recycling metaphor. But anyhoo&amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Pets Seen as Self Indulgent:&lt;/strong&gt; In this context buying a dog from a breeder is seen as self-indulgent and possibly even unethical.  When Vice President Joe Biden bought a German Sheppard from a breeder he received intense push back. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/unleashed/2008/12/joe-bidens-pupp.html&quot;&gt;LA times did a survey&lt;/a&gt; and among respondents &amp;#8220;42% say that Biden made the right choice in purchasing from a breeder, while 31% say he should have adopted a rescued dog&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; *&lt;em&gt;Two Words, &amp;#8220;Cesar Millan&amp;#8221;: *&lt;/em&gt;Dog training celebrity Cesar Millan has thrust rescue dogs into the spotlight. On his website &lt;a href=&quot;http://cesarsway.com&quot;&gt;Cesarsway&lt;/a&gt; Cesar regularly promotes rescues and the joy of rehabilitating dogs to give them a full and happy life. He also dramatizes harrowing dog rescues. Please note the music in the background in this video&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.** The rise of Dog Psychology:** There&amp;#8217;s a current fascination about getting inside a dog&amp;#8217;s mind (Or really any animal&amp;#8217;s mind &amp;#8211;think Temple Grandin)  The thinking goes that with the right kind of human understanding any dog can be rehabilitated&amp;#8211;even a rescue. Central to this trend are people like&lt;a href=&quot;http://erikaritter.com/page.htm&quot;&gt; Erica Ritter who has written novels from a dog&amp;#8217;s perspective&lt;/a&gt;,  but also The Monks of Skeete who meticulously train German Sheppards in a Monestary in New Skeete New York. Check out this video below called What is a Dog?  where they say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;you try and understand the dog as it really is and along with that you try to bring an intuitive element to your relationship with the dog that allows you to meet it on a new level, a deeper level&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**&lt;br&gt;
**So, what do you think is behind the whole rescue dog phenomenon? Has it been around and I&amp;#8217;m just now noticing because I got a dog (did I tell you, &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8112/welcome-to-the-team-blue&quot;&gt;I got a dog?&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have a rescue dog? If so, tell me what it&amp;#8217;s all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huffington Post Canada wrote a great article about Canadian B Corps which features great Canadian companies like &lt;a href=&quot;http://ianmartin.com/&quot;&gt;Ian Martin Group&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ethicalbean.com/&quot;&gt;Ethical Bean Coffee.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The owner of Vancouver Investment Fund &lt;a href=&quot;http://renewal2.ca/&quot;&gt;Renewal 2&lt;/a&gt; put it best by saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B Corp certifications add a layer of confidence and are a signal of a level of commitment and values by an entrepreneur or company&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  We&amp;#8217;re loving our B Corp status and the cred it brings. If you&amp;#8217;re interested in becoming B Corp just ask us and we&amp;#8217;ll tell you why we&amp;#8217;re so keen on it.
&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ontario Lakes Project: Lake Bernard</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/ontario-lakes-project-lake-bernard/"/>

&lt;p&gt;According to the&lt;a href=&quot;ttp://www.worldrecordsacademy.org/&quot;&gt; World Records Academy &lt;/a&gt;, Lake Bernard is the world&amp;#8217;s largest fresh water lake without any islands in it. Kind of a neat statistic don&amp;#8217;t cha think? Especially when you consider how many islands populate the lakes surrounding Lake Bernard throughout the Muscoka region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s even cooler is that many believe that Lake Bernard is so unique because it was created by an ancient meteor strike. That&amp;#8217;s right, a large piece of debris from our solar system hit the earth and made this lake where people now sit in Adirondack chairs, wearing flip flops and and sipping bloody Ceasars all summer long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to bike through winter in Toronto</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/how-to-bike-through-winter-in-toronto/"/>
   <updated>2012-01-31T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/how-to-bike-through-winter-in-toronto</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Guide to winter cycling &quot; src=&quot;http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lxntdwlk7d1ql0mrko1_500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cycling through the city is a very popular activity during the summer, however lots of people in Toronto decide to leave their bike in storage for the winter season. Personally, I find that the benefits of biking every day are bigger than the obstacles, so I try to keep going year round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some the things I find helpful to overcome many of the inconveniences of biking in cold weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Personal gear: You really don’t need a lot more than what you normally use for winter. Your body gets warm fairly quickly so you just need to focus on covering your head: tuk and helmet or hoodie*; face: glasses and bandana; hands: good pair of mittens and feet: snow boots or rubber boots plus some heavy socks. *Be careful when using a hoodie because it blocks peripheral vision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Bike gear: Obviously lights are key, fenders will save you from most of the splattering water ponds, slush or whatever’s on the ground, but the thing that changed my life was getting a rearview mirror. This may apply always when riding your bike in the city, but the rearview mirror is especially helpful in winter when you’re wearing your parka hoodie and you can’t turn back very easily. You can get one at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mec.ca/AST/ShopMEC/Cycling/BellsMirrorsReflectors/PRD~4011-495/mec-mountain-cycling-mirror.jsp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MEC&lt;/a&gt; for only 5 dollars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Choosing your route. If it snowed recently it is better to stay on main streets because cars and traffic clear the snow faster so you don’t have to deal with it.  For the same reason, bike lanes accumulate ice and slush and it is better to avoid them. I also prefer to stick with the most direct route so I don’t spend more time outside than necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Change of clothes. There are some days of continuous light rain when biking will save you lots of streetcar waiting time and crowded subways, you just have to be willing to get wet. I wear a long raincoat and rubber boots so I only have to change my tights when I get to the office. I suggest you try it; after all it is only water falling from the sky not sulfuric acid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Know your limits. There’s a balance between pushing yourself to overcome a challenge and putting yourself in danger. Not everyday is a cycling day, I can tell you from experience that riding your bike through a blizzard or heavy rain is a bad idea mainly because you can’t really see and neither can cars around you. I would also not ride if the streets were not clear. I guess it all comes down to common sense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Enjoy all the benefits. You save money and time. You keep yourself fit and fight any possible winter blues with physical activity. You don’t get stuck in traffic jams and you get exactly where you want to go without depending on anything other that yourself and your bike, that is what I call freedom.&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; src=&quot;http://4000more.org/4000more.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/screen-shot-2011-01-05-at-12-34-39-amaf90.png?w=600&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;397&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as I was about to finish this blog post, my boss Barry sent me this invitation from the &lt;a title=&quot;Toronto Cyclists Union&quot; href=&quot;http://bikeunion.to/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Toronto Cyclists Union&lt;/a&gt; for an event called &lt;a title=&quot;365 Days of Cycling&quot; href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/events/upcoming#!/events/254874251252725/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;365 Days of Biking&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; An Evening of art and Cycling&lt;/a&gt;  happening this next Thursday February 2nd at the Centre for Social Innovation. I might go and check it out, take a look.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ferris Bueller Part 2 &#8211; The Letdown</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/ferris-bueller-part-2-the-letdown/"/>
   <updated>2012-01-31T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/ferris-bueller-part-2-the-letdown</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Or alternatively &amp;#8220;How to damage 4 brands in 2 minutes&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;#8217;m beginning to understand the outrage my parents felt when Bank of Montreal launched its re-branding as BMO using a Bob Dylan song.  The new Honda CRV commercial, which is a tribute to Ferris Bueller&amp;#8217;s Day Off is debuting this weekend at the Super Bowl. It&amp;#8217;s been leaked, and I couldn&amp;#8217;t resist watching it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first saw Ferris, I was 11, the movie had just come out in theaters and I was in love with it. It was funny, and rebellious, and poignant.  Most importantly though it was clever. This commercial is the exact opposite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the synopsis on the YouTube page the marketing copy is enthusiastic, and a bit disingenuous:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relive movie history with Honda&amp;#8217;s fresh twist and wonderful homage to this &amp;#8217;80s classic. Think you&amp;#8217;re a true fan of Ferris Bueller&amp;#8217;s Day Off? We hid over two dozen references to the movie throughout the commercial. Some are obvious, some are VERY subtle. See how many you can find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fresh twist? Not to nitpick but you&amp;#8217;re copying a movie that&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091042/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;25 years old&lt;/a&gt;, and your fresh spin on it is to put the now 50 year old star in a 2 minute remake (sorry tribute) minus the other cast, the well written dialogue, and the cool sports car? Your fresh twist is a bit of a let down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real risk might have been to show us Ferris Bueller at 50, did he marry Sloane? How&amp;#8217;s Cameron doing? If the goal is to connect with your audience you&amp;#8217;ve got to make them feel something, and sadly with all of the potential here, all I felt was bored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would you have done instead? Should we start a write-in campaign to Honda?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8319/five-career-myths-worth-busting-from-doors-wide-open/attachment/screen-shot-2012-01-30-at-1-57-27-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-8322&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-8322&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2012-01-30 at 1.57.27 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-shot-2012-01-30-at-1.57.27-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;335&quot; height=&quot;513&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I was invited to participate in the inaugural &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.doorswideopen.ca/&quot;&gt;Doors Wide Open&lt;/a&gt;, an event that was all about getting young up and comers out to interview mentors who have turned their passions into careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The organizers called  it: &amp;#8220;speed dating meets career fair.&amp;#8221;  I call it &amp;#8220;career day on speed.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat down with six different folks throughout the night. While each of them had different questions and experiences I walked away with a very clear sense of some of the myths/perceptions about how careers work that might be holding some of them back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the key take-aways I hope I left them with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Please (please) do not send your resume by email (and expect anyone to care.)&lt;/strong&gt; As the person on the other side of the computer I can tell you that all resumes start to look alike. You gotta work it girlfriend. Network your ass off to find people to talk to, take to coffee or lunch to meet who you need to meet to get the job you want. If I meet someone great, I&amp;#8217;ll figure out how to help them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Accept that the beginning is meant to be confusing.&lt;/strong&gt; People beat themselves up feeling like they should have it all &amp;#8220;figured out by now&amp;#8221;. The fact is there&amp;#8217;s a decade called your 20&amp;#8242;s that is custom made for trying some stuff out. Go have some fun and release the pressure valve and you&amp;#8217;ll learn what you need to know (I feel like a Jedi Warrior right now). If you trust me your life will be much better. Trust me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; *&lt;em&gt;Love Your Networks: *&lt;/em&gt; If you want to meet someone in the advertising field, start by going to facebook and typing &amp;#8220;does anyone know someone in advertising? If so, can you connect me? I&amp;#8217;m looking for a job.&amp;#8221; See what happens. If someone asks you to lend them a hand, do the same (it&amp;#8217;s called Karma.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Give it Away Now.&lt;/strong&gt; If you can find a way to afford it, I suggest working for free. We&amp;#8217;ve hired three people who were former interns, and all have been amazing. None had to wait too long before they got some kind of remuneration. If you&amp;#8217;re working hard and remuneration&amp;#8217;s not forthcoming move on, but it&amp;#8217;s worth a shot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; *&lt;em&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t Wait. Do Something. *&lt;/em&gt;I met a lovely woman who is interested in revitalizing community spaces. She was looking for a job in the field and having a bit of a struggle. My advice?  Go revitalize some community spaces! There are parks, community gardens, seniors&amp;#8217; centres all around her community that could use her passion, skills and expertise. Then she&amp;#8217;d have something to show for her work. A blog is nice, but a garden&amp;#8211; better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Photoshop; Does it make every photo a lie?</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/photoshop-is-it-too-much/"/>
   <updated>2012-01-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/photoshop-is-it-too-much</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This video was in my Facebook news feed yesterday:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/34813864&quot;&gt;Fotoshop by Adobé&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/jesserosten&quot;&gt;Jesse Rosten&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com&quot;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost every image we look at has had some kind of tweek. (Hypenotic&amp;#8217;s own Graphic Designer Sonja photoshops most of her Facebook profile pictures. Don&amp;#8217;t tell her I told you.) From basic colour correction to a complete metamorphosis; it&amp;#8217;s a given that every beauty industry marketing image we look at is false. Every single one. And we have no idea to what extent. As consumers we rely on these ads to show us how a beauty product will perform. I can&amp;#8217;t take lipstick back to Shopper&amp;#8217;s if it isn&amp;#8217;t plumping my lips as promised on the packaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a however a growing backlash. Recently L&amp;#8217;Oreal ads were &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pcworld.com/article/236808/julia_roberts_ad_banned_in_the_uk_for_abuse_of_photoshop.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;banned in the UK&lt;/a&gt; for being too photoshopped. And in the US, there is now a push to pass the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jezebel.com/5848194/concerned-parents-look-to-pass-the-self+esteem-act&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Self Esteem Act&lt;/a&gt;, which would label all photos that had been airbrushed or photoshopped in any significant way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8161/photoshop-is-it-too-much/attachment/realjodi_vs_photoshopjodi-4&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-8214&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft  wp-image-8214&quot; title=&quot;RealJodi_vs_PhotoshopJodi&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/RealJodi_vs_PhotoshopJodi3-580x387.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;348&quot; height=&quot;232&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;At this point though as savvy (and cynical) consumers of marketing aren&amp;#8217;t we aware we&amp;#8217;re being lied to? We all still have pores, blemishes, age spots and wrinkles despite all of the promises cosmetic companies have made to us. I know my mac foundation isn&amp;#8217;t going to make my nose smaller and my wrinkles disappear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it speaks to a greater problem though. And that is:  How do we make beauty marketing meaningful? Right now as consumers we know it&amp;#8217;s currently all about figuring out the lie. Do we legislate it? Can companies be counted on for self-regulation and transparency? (I think there&amp;#8217;s a significantly greater chance of this in an age of social marketing, and  with the rapid dissemination of information on-line. But I also think I&amp;#8217;m a bit naive.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think? Can we move to honesty in cosmetics and beauty advertising? Are we ready as a culture to accept natural bodies and faces on magazine covers and in advertising? Is this a slow shift or something we should jump into? And is this part of a greater shift of self acceptance and rejection of current unattainable standards of beauty?&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2012-01-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/ontario-lakes-project-lake-belwood</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/ontario-lakes-project/8238/ontario-lakes-project-lake-belwood/attachment/bellwoods-3&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-8278&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8278&quot; title=&quot;BELLWOODS&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/BELLWOODS2-580x750.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;750&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/ontario-lakes-project/8238/ontario-lakes-project-lake-belwood/attachment/bellwoods-2&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-8274&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/ontario-lakes-project/8238/ontario-lakes-project-lake-belwood/attachment/bellwoods&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-8271&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;Lake Belwood is home to one of the events in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trisportcanada.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;World&amp;#8217;s Largest Triathlon&lt;/a&gt; series.  This event is internationally known and has been important to the careers of several famous Canadian triathletes including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jasperblake.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jasper Blake&lt;/a&gt; and Canadian Olympic medalist &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Whitfield&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Simon Whitfield&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s very cool but there&amp;#8217;s not a lot of concrete information about the race. That was until I stumbled upon race reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a whole culture of amateur triathletes reporting their races. They talk about their times, how the temperature of the water affected their stroke, where they stopped for Gatorade vs. water, and if their electrolyte levels caused them to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marshmallowman2ironman.com/2009/07/race-report-belwood-sprint-triathlon.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cramp&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s really quite detailed, right down to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marshmallowman2ironman.com/2009/07/race-report-belwood-sprint-triathlon.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;muddiness of the water&lt;/a&gt; during the swim, and how they &lt;a href=&quot;http://snail-male.blogspot.com/2009/08/my-first-triathlon-longer-to-read-than.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;changed out of their wetsuits&lt;/a&gt; without falling over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next hurdle for me was the whole dignity-exiting-the-water thing, and I knew I had to nail this one or else make the sort of spectacle that&amp;#8217;s painfully retold for ages at family gatherings. Discretion being the better part of valour, I chose to not break into a heroic sprint as soon as possible and risk falling, and instead staggered up to the transition zone with the measured purpose of a bar patron zig-zagging to the john after several hours of drinking. &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;http://snail-male.blogspot.com/2009/08/my-first-triathlon-longer-to-read-than.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Stephen B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#8217;re very human stories and as a person who isn&amp;#8217;t particularly athletic I found them quite compelling. And almost inspirational enough to consider taking up biking again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny how triathlon works sometimes. You know that old saying that you can&amp;#8217;t win the race in the swim but you can lose it&amp;#8230;well its true. In a 90 minute endurance event my race was essentially over in the first three seconds. &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;http://ryanpower-tri.blogspot.com/2009/07/belwood-race-report.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ryan Power&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a race report from Get Out There magazine, who was at last year&amp;#8217;s triathlon.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Building Relationships Through Content: It&#8217;s the Little Things</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/building-relationships-through-content-its-the-little-things/"/>
   <updated>2012-01-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/building-relationships-through-content-its-the-little-things</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just bought pet insurance. Of course like all kinds of insurance there&amp;#8217;s a mental leap you have to take while your puppy is full of vim and vigor. But, I&amp;#8217;ve spoken to enough people to believe it&amp;#8217;s a wise investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know what the best part was? This little note I got when I confirmed purchase of my monthly pet insurance plan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We know that if your pet could speak they&amp;#8217;d thank you for being a responsible pet parent and ensuring that when the unexpected occurs they will be&amp;#8230; All taken care of.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a little corny, but it takes the sting out of the monthly draw that will be suddenly coming out of my bank account along with a whole lot of other unexpected purchases that go along with being a dog owner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kind of messages could you be sending&amp;#8211;for free&amp;#8211;when you communicate with your customers? Here are a bunch of free online exchanges that you could make the most of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;404 or error pages&lt;/strong&gt;: When people take a wrong turn on your website, take the opportunity to feel a little less lost and ease their frustration and impatience so they stick around longer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Email address confirmation&lt;/strong&gt;: When people sign up for your newsletter, what kind of information are you sending them when you  confirm their email  address. Why not let people assure people they&amp;#8217;ve made a good decision and that you&amp;#8217;ll treat their email carefully.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Friend requests:&lt;/strong&gt; When you send out an invitation to a friend or contact to join your social network use the message box to make them feel good about joining you. It&amp;#8217;s just lazy to click the box without taking a moment to make it personal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any other ideas for free opportunities to make customers, clients and friends feel good?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ontario Lakes Project: Beech Lake</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/ontario-lakes-project-beech-lake/"/>
   <updated>2012-01-19T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/ontario-lakes-project-beech-lake</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/ontario-lakes-project/8191/ontario-lakes-project-beech-lake/attachment/beech-lake&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-8230&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8230&quot; title=&quot;beech-lake&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/beech-lake-580x522.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;522&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post about Beech Lake and Sasquatch comes from a blog post on &lt;a href=&quot;http://cfz-canada.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;The Centre for Fortean Zoology Canada&amp;#8217;s website.&lt;/a&gt; In case you&amp;#8217;re wondering, Fortean Zoology occupies itself with the mysteries underlying species that have not yet been proven to exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have included excerpts from the post, but you can find &lt;a href=&quot;http://cfz-canada.blogspot.com/2011/12/my-name-is-matthew-and-i-blame-minden.html&quot;&gt;the (much longer) post here. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My name is Matthew, and I blame Minden, Ontario for my fear of Sasquatch.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;by Guest Blogger Matthew J. Didier, PSICAN&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I became fascinated with Sasquatch because he smelled bad&amp;#8230; and I have always had an odd fear of extremely bad smells&amp;#8230; This said, I would not have thought about, considered, or even known about Sasquatch&amp;#8217;s odour had it not been for a particularly bad&amp;#8230;documentary that was once shown at the old Beaver Theatre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents would often travel to the little island we owned on Beech Lake for entire summers&amp;#8230; often leading to extremely bored kids, and a movie &amp;#8220;in the big town&amp;#8221; was often a cure for what is most properly called &amp;#8220;cabin fever&amp;#8221; in these cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw most of my first James Bond films at both The Beaver in Minden and the Molou in Haliburton Village&amp;#8230; but&amp;#8230;it was Bigfoot&amp;#8217;s stink that held me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember bothering my mother and father consistently&amp;#8230; about sightings and evidence of Sasquatch in and around the Minden &amp;#8211; Carnarvon &amp;#8211; Haliburton corridor&amp;#8230; although their re-assurance was little help for my insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only relief that summer came from the ride back into the Sasquatch-Free land of the big city, with it&amp;#8217;s constant noise and lights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  I honestly don&amp;#8217;t know why I feel that this entry is &amp;#8220;worthy&amp;#8221; of posting&amp;#8230; perhaps to say that there&amp;#8217;s a myriad of ways and times in one&amp;#8217;s life that an interest in the paranormal comes to them&amp;#8230; and that not all of us &amp;#8220;outgrow&amp;#8221; it because we &amp;#8220;know better.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/div&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8167/bushy-eyebrows-make-meaningful-marketing/attachment/screen-shot-2012-01-16-at-1-19-55-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-8168&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-8168&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2012-01-16 at 1.19.55 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-shot-2012-01-16-at-1.19.55-PM-e1326739855525.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;373&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  These posters are stapled to poles up and down Queen West&amp;#8211;one of the most cluttered places in all of Toronto. Ads for cleaning ladies are literally layered with ads for club nights and promotions for films about the perils of climate change. Hard to get eyeballs.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  Or better yet, eyebrows. These ads for a shop specializing in eyebrow design are arresting and funny. The image works by  juxtaposing fashion photography with a scary, bushy unibrow.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  The business behind the ads is &lt;a href=&quot;http://eyelovebeautybar.com&quot;&gt;Eye Love &lt;/a&gt;a &amp;#8220;brow and beauty bar&amp;#8221; owned by Mary Dang. Mary was looking for a cost effective way to stand out, and she found it with the help of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hermannaudrey.com/&quot;&gt;Herman and Audrey&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  When our brows are unkempt we know we aren&amp;#8217;t looking our best. The ad uses hyperbole to remind us what we might be looking like when things get a little Groucho Marx up there.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  Reminds me of this Schick ad encouraging women to &amp;#8220;mow the lawn&amp;#8221; so all that&amp;#8217;s left are &amp;#8220;tulips on the mound.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  Enjoy, and go tidy up!  Unless you find this stuff offensive, in which case, tell me why.
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/fun-stuff/8177/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-winter/attachment/tumblr_lxx62wts851qierano1_1280&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-8478&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8478&quot; title=&quot;tumblr_lxx62wTs851qierano1_1280&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/tumblr_lxx62wTs851qierano1_1280-580x750.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;It is 4 degrees&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;750&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Canadians love to talk about the weather and I don’t blame them. Weather affects how we dress, how we transport and how we feel every day. Especially during winter, it is impossible to forget the fact that it is ten degrees below zero or to ignore that the wind-chill can make it feel even worse.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
    I am Mexican, so this is only the third real winter I’ve experience in my life. For me every aspect of winter is a novelty. Whenever I go back home I find myself trying to explain to people how cold feels like up here. I end up using analogies and saying things like:
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Sometimes the cold air is very aggressive and feels like it punches you in the face as soon as you get out of your house. When it gets really bad I feel like my life is actually in danger. After some months of winter I start doubting that that trees will be green again and that flowers will grow underneath the piles of snow, I feel hopeless. When winter is finally over I wonder if I could ever go through it again, then I go out to enjoy every minute of sun and heat I can get and promise never to complain if it feels too hot.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
    Lots of feelings get stirred up during winter so instead of suffering them I decided to observe them and express them in a project. I’m calling this project &lt;a href=&quot;http://angelykke.tumblr.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;100+ Days of Winter&lt;/a&gt;; my intention is to create a visual diary of the winter using graphic design. I’m interested in watching the weather change little by little and documenting it for a hundred days by showing its numbers and the feelings associated with them. It is also revealing how our perspective changes depending on the context, for example a day of -6 after a day of -26 feels like such a relief it brings positive feelings, it feels &lt;a href=&quot;http://angelykke.tumblr.com/post/15325909138/january4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;like a picnic&lt;/a&gt;!
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
    Many times ideas come flowing form random conversations, with people I ran into in the elevator or at the office, transforming the so-called “small talk” into fuel for creativity.
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
    I&amp;#8217;m only at day 11 so far, so please &lt;a href=&quot;http://angelykke.tumblr.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;take a look&lt;/a&gt;, tell me what you think and more importantly, how does it feel today?
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
    &amp;nbsp;
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canoeing on a secluded lake is the quintessential Ontario lake experience. This sense of serenity is beautifully captured by Peter Bowers&amp;#8217; series of Basshaunt Lake photographs. The photos of Halliburton&amp;#8217;s Basshaunt Lake featured the photographer&amp;#8217;s friend and have been reposted all over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The image below even made it to one &lt;a href=&quot;http://pinterest.com/kristinaburkley/my-bucket-list/&quot;&gt;pinterest &lt;/a&gt;sharing page called &lt;a href=&quot;http://pinterest.com/kristinaburkley/my-bucket-list/&quot;&gt;My Bucket List.  &lt;/a&gt;Here are a few of the photographers&amp;#8217; best.

   <title>Learn what Moms and Puppy Owners Already Know</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/8144/"/>
   <updated>2012-01-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/8144</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8144/8144/attachment/screen-shot-2012-01-11-at-12-35-52-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-8147&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-8147&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2012-01-11 at 12.35.52 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-shot-2012-01-11-at-12.35.52-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;380&quot; height=&quot;290&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New moms often claim &amp;#8220;nobody told me&amp;#8221; about the many unappealing parts of motherhood. However,  I&amp;#8217;m starting think that the &amp;#8220;nobody told me&amp;#8221; claim is a slice of pure Oscar Meyer&amp;#8217;s bologna. Before you try to strangle me (especially you who, exhausted looking mom foaming at the mouth), hear me out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I get that no one told you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Breastfeeding would be so hard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Being a parent is fucking exhausting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  You will likely have moments where you want to  throw the kid out the window or politely return her to the hospital murmuring &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m sorry I think I&amp;#8217;ve made a terrible mistake&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why would you know this stuff before it was relevant to you? Face it, even if someone told you, you wouldn&amp;#8217;t have been the least bit interested when you were busy living* t&lt;em&gt;he free and easy&lt;/em&gt; vida loca*. Sure if we grew up in multi-generational families you may have had an inkling of how breastfeeding actually worked, but that&amp;#8217;s not the world most of us live in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we are all living on a need to know basis. And with the internet at hand, it&amp;#8217;s not so bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have a new Australian Sheppard puppy named Blue I find myself feeling the &amp;#8220;nobody told me&amp;#8221; feeling coming on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Nobody told me toilet training takes so long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Nobody told me how you have to teach a dog to walk on a leash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Nobody told me how mentally exhausting it is watching your dog trying to decide if you need to go outside (yet again) only to have him shit the moment you bring him back inside&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, now I need to know, and so I do (well, starting to anyway).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Puppy ownership has thrust me into an entirely new community of interest. In this new community (where you have to watch where you step)  I can access all kinds of information I never needed to know before.  I can lock eyes with other dog owners and share a moment of shared identification; My google and youtube searches have taken a new turn; will make dog friends, write annoying puppy-centric facebook posts and call my male dog &amp;#8216;buddy&amp;#8217; (which even I find annoying).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My identity profile has changed. I&amp;#8217;ve joined a new specialized group. Hear me bark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s my latest favorite video on how to walk a dog&amp;#8211;walk a dog? Nobody told me. Hey Buddy, how &amp;#8217;bout you just &lt;em&gt;walk&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I&amp;#8217;m a member of a whole new community of interest&amp;#8211;Aussie puppy owner. If you see me walking Blue down the street, waiting patiently for him to decide to start walking again  (as I look over my right shoulder without saying a word or making a noise) feel free to say hello, or better yet, offer us a ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  Blue is our charming new office dog. He&amp;#8217;s a 10 week old Australian Shepherd and the reason I probably won&amp;#8217;t be getting much work done today. You should come by and meet him!

   <title>Skip ROI. Try ROE (Experience).</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/skip-roi-try-roe-experience/"/>
   <updated>2012-01-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/skip-roi-try-roe-experience</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/making-pizza-dough-in-my-kitchen.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-14264&quot; alt=&quot;Public domain image, royalty free stock photo from www.public-domain-image.com&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/making-pizza-dough-in-my-kitchen.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, a pizza-maker at a chain (re)taught me one of marketing&amp;#8217;s most important lessons: the value of a good story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was at a place called &lt;a href=&quot;http://anthonyscoalfiredpizza.com/&quot; title=&quot;Anthony&amp;#39;s Coal Fired Pizza&quot;&gt;Anthony&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt;, where they make coal-fired pizza. We were there because the food is good, which is enough, but for Anthony&amp;#8217;s, apparently good food is the bar for entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My 4 year old daughter wanted to see the pizzas being made so I brought her around the side of the bar they were using and stood her on a chair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the flurry of 6 people hopping around the two ovens, one asked if she&amp;#8217;d like some dough. We&amp;#8217;ve had the offer of a piece of dough to play with before at Mother&amp;#8217;s Dumplings in Toronto for years, so that&amp;#8217;s what we were expecting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A minute later, another fellow yanked a full flattened pie of raw dough onto a plate, put it in front of us, and before I could ask what we were supposed to do with it, gave Pip a handful of cheese. He told her to spread it around. She asked for sauce, and he dipped a ladle in their pizza sauce and poured it on. Then he asked her what she liked on her pizza. She replied, he supplied, we decorated together, and he got someone to put the pie in the oven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went back to our table, told my delighted in-laws and Pippa&amp;#8217;s jealous sister what happened, and Pippa alternated between gloating and being thrilled for the next 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it came, she nearly exploded with excitement, but she let us all taste it. Naturally, to her, nothing was going to taste as good for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was in Boca, where people spend most of each day deciding what they&amp;#8217;re going to do for dinner. At Xmas, so their relatives were visiting. at 6:30pm, with a line-up out the door. In the grand scheme of things, it didn&amp;#8217;t take him much effort or cost him much. But the payoff includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Guaranteed future visits from us&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Likely visits from my family (2 brothers and 2 sisters, each with spouses and 2 kids, plus my parents)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Likely visits from people each of us tell about the story, and the people they tell, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  This blog post, which gets read by enough people when I post, but will be indexed by search engines and served up in perpetuity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to matter how many times you hear it from hallowed, New York Times best-selling marketing gurus, people just don&amp;#8217;t seem to clue in to the power of good stories. Long story short:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Stories travel in ways traditional communications can&amp;#8217;t hold a candle to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  They last (sometimes getting more interesting over time!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  We hear them from trusted peers, not brands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  If they&amp;#8217;re good enough, people will write about them, increasing their chance of being seen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me leave you with 3 questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Have you been witness to the creation of any good stories?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Any thoughts on stories you can create for your organization?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Can surprising and delighting people be part of your content strategy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Ontario Lakes Project: Bass Lake</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/ontario-lakes-project-bass-lake/"/>
   <updated>2012-01-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/ontario-lakes-project-bass-lake</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8076/ontario-lakes-project-bass-lake/attachment/bass&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-8085&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-8085&quot; title=&quot;bass&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/bass-580x347.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;347&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While searching out content for this week&amp;#8217;s Ontario Lake, I stumbled on this sweet &amp;amp; charming video of a family picking apples at Bass Lake. But that&amp;#8217;s just where the story begins&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video features a woman named Ada Grexton and was posted by Jason Merling. I reached out to Jason on Facebook and Twitter and finally got his number through a mutual Facebook friend. What a world we live in where I can get the phone number of someone I only know through YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lake featured in the video is not actually called Bass Lake, it&amp;#8217;s called Lake Aberdine, but folks who live around the lake named it for the amount of Bass you find there.It&amp;#8217;s just south of Sault Ste. Marie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truth be told, it&amp;#8217;s not the Bass Lake we intended to write about, but finding Jason and hearing his story made this the Bass Lake worth writing about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The property was cleared (and therefore owned) by Jason&amp;#8217;s great grandparents and became a family compound. It was a farm with many apple trees like the ones you see in the video. Today, all of the Apple Trees are gone, having succumbed to disease over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But much of the property&amp;#8217;s charm has been preserved. To this day there is no power or electricity on the property. Jason&amp;#8217;s grandfather was an early &amp;#8220;back to the land&amp;#8221; thinker, and he would have wanted it that way. Another way the family acknowledges the significance of the property is by having a family reunion on the compound every July 1st. The highlight of the reunion is the &amp;#8220;walk&amp;#8221;&amp;#8211;a 3-4 mile walk between the compound and the town of Leeburn. Some years as many as 100 family members take the walk that was taken by Ada Grexton featured n the video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to Jason Merling for taking the time to talk about Bass Lake.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Real Men Get Real Mental  Illness</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/does-focusing-on-sport-and-military-related-mental-illness-help-men/"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8054/does-focusing-on-sport-and-military-related-mental-illness-help-men/attachment/screen-shot-2012-01-02-at-1-08-57-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-8069&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-8069&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2012-01-02 at 1.08.57 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-shot-2012-01-02-at-1.08.57-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;485&quot; height=&quot;362&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mental health consequence of sport-inflicted head injuries is making headlines. Hockey players like Derek Boogaard have died as a result of multiple head injuries and they have the autopsied &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/06/sports/hockey/derek-boogaard-a-brain-going-bad.html?pagewanted=1&quot;&gt;damaged brains &lt;/a&gt;to prove it. NFL players are launching &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/sports_nut/2011/02/the_nfls_next_big_headache.html&quot;&gt;a class action suit&lt;/a&gt; against the League for failing to protect them from the brain injuries they currently suffer from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly returning soldiers suffering from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/02/us/acting-helps-soldier-cope-with-post-traumatic-stress-disorder.html?scp=2&amp;amp;sq=ptsd%20military&amp;amp;st=cse&quot;&gt;Post Traumatic Stress&lt;/a&gt; have been the subject of much attention and governments are&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8634277.stm&quot;&gt; currently dedicating significant resources &lt;/a&gt;to raise awareness so that soldiers can get the treatment they need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as awareness about male mental illness is of great social value, the hyper-masculinization of mental illness may not do much for the majority of men who suffer for much less grandiose reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s an ad from UK&amp;#8217;s leading Veteran&amp;#8217;s Mental Health Charity, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.combatstress.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Combat Stress&lt;/a&gt; powerfully depicting PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should say, I have a personal investment in promoting men&amp;#8217;s mental health. Ten years ago my brother Tracy died in a car crash. He had spent most of his life suffering from mental illness that significantly diminished his quality of life. It wasn&amp;#8217;t the result of hockey or war. It was more likely the cause of some bad wiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I consider all of the progress being made in the area of male mental illness, I ask myself whether the current climate of awareness around men&amp;#8217;s mental health would have made a difference in his life. Frankly, as much as he was a huge (huge, huge) hockey fan, I&amp;#8217;m not convinced that depression and disorders caused by head-injuries would have relieved him of the shame he felt as a result of suffering from mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the focus on male mental illness does help bring it out of the closet,  the way in which it is currently being addressed doesn&amp;#8217;t help with the mental health issues faced by most men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s face it. For most men mental illness is not a result of some grand heroic gesture. It&amp;#8217;s not because their brains have been shaken loose or because they have witnessed horrible atrocities. It&amp;#8217;s a much more mundane part of their daily lives which comes with a daily dose of shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the mental health movement really needs is a way to address the stigma associated with the most common forms of mental illness in men. Consider the findings from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mind.org.uk/help/people_groups_and_communities/mens_mental_health&quot;&gt;a Mental Health NGO in the UK&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Depression occurs as often in men as in women, but women are twice as likely to be diagnosed and treated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  One in nine adult men is dependent on alcohol; men are three times more likely than women to be alcohol dependent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Men who meet a diagnosis of a personality disorder are heavily represented in the prison population&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes alot of bravery for men to stand up and say they are suffering. But maybe this bravery business is overrated.  A great campaign out of Australia taking a different tact by telling men to &lt;a href=&quot;http://softenthefckup.com.au/&quot;&gt;Soften the Fck Up&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s not a magic bullet solution (there&amp;#8217;s no such thing), but it is an interesting way to think about how we can begin to address it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So do men need to Soften Up, Buck Up, Stand Up, Shut Up? How do you think mainstream male mental illness should be addressed? Do you think focusing on sports celebrities and military heroes helps the issue?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I predict you&amp;#8217;ll see alot more on this issue in 2012. Let&amp;#8217;s get the conversation going.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Jews get it right again &#8211; Technology Shabbat</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/the-jews-get-it-right-again/"/>
   <updated>2011-12-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/the-jews-get-it-right-again</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;*Full Disclosure, I am a Jew but I&amp;#8217;m more -ish*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent most of last week really sick. I slept the most I have in years, 12-14 hours every night, plus naps. There may have been some homemade chicken soup involved. And I spent almost no time on my iPhone. My laptop didn&amp;#8217;t get very much love either. As a person who quite frequently is actively using her phone, laptop, and an iPad at the same time it was a huge shift for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/fun-stuff/7951/the-jews-get-it-right-again/attachment/sick-cat&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-7984&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-7984&quot; title=&quot;sick-cat&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/sick-cat.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;When you&amp;#8217;re couch bound and sleeping solidly you get a glimpse of a different life. Your regular day to day routine and stressors are replaced by a fairly simple existence.  I don&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;ve been that relaxed in a really long time. Instead of my usual litany of rolling to-do&amp;#8217;s, multiple in-boxes to check, and the weight of deadlines I simply pondered which soup I wanted and would I have apple sauce or jell-o? I knit. I read from an actual hardcover book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than one of my friends has related the same thing to me. The only real time off they&amp;#8217;ve had lately comes from being incredibly sick. And I think it comes from our in-ability to unplug. It&amp;#8217;s more and more difficult to stop constantly searching for information to share or want to know what&amp;#8217;s going on all the time. I have six email accounts, four Twitter accounts and one for work, monitor five Facebook accounts; two of which are mine, three Tumblrs, LinkedIn, Foursquare, G+, Path, and two google reader accounts. And I love it. I find it all incredibly interesting and stimulating. But I am losing sleep and downtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jews have had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/fun-stuff/7951/the-jews-get-it-right-again/attachment/unplugged&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-7987&quot;&gt;sabbath&lt;/a&gt; for thousands of years. From Friday at sundown to Saturday at sundown Orthodox Jews (and otherwise) take a day of rest. &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/fun-stuff/7951/the-jews-get-it-right-again/attachment/unplugged-2&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-7996&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-7996&quot; title=&quot;unplugged&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/unplugged1-250x250.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The idea is that you take that time to get closer to God, celebrate your time together and your family.  You can read and talk and study and eat (yum!) but you can&amp;#8217;t use any technology.  And this day of rest is now being adopted as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://switchofftunein.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;screen free&lt;/a&gt; day by a growing number of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#8217;s a brilliant idea, and something I&amp;#8217;m hoping to introduce into my own life but without a landline I&amp;#8217;m not sure how I could go a whole day without using my smartphone. Have you gone screen free yet? Did you make it a whole day? How did it work for you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  Nestled in the Kawartha highlands, Bark Lake is home to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.barklake.com/&quot;&gt;Bark Lake Leadership Centre&lt;/a&gt; which starting in 1969, trained young folks who worked at summer camps or volunteered with outdoor clubs or youth groups.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  You could say they were an early adopter of, now trendy, environmental education training.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  The world has caught up to Bark Lake. Today the centre offers environmental leadership training to kids and adults year round. Here&amp;#8217;s a taste of what they offer in their W.I.L.D training program which instructs educators on how to provide outdoor education.

&lt;p&gt;Of course I&amp;#8217;m responsible for putting plenty of it out there over the years, but now I&amp;#8217;m 40, I need reading glasses, and I empathize with everyone who has been peering down their nose through bifocals at our website.&lt;br&gt;
In 2012, I&amp;#8217;m going to set type bigger. Then I&amp;#8217;m going to look at our metrics and see what impact it has on our readership. I&amp;#8217;ll let you know.

   <title>What an economist can teach you about Social Media</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/what-an-economist-can-teach-you-about-social-media/"/>
   <updated>2011-12-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/what-an-economist-can-teach-you-about-social-media</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last October in Turin, Italy,  I was one of about 100 people captivated by economist Manfred Max Neef&amp;#8217;s ability to communicate critical and complex concepts through simple, sometimes passionate, sometimes funny anecdotes. Because they were conveyed so compellingly, several have stuck with me. One in particular might explain why so many people (still) don&amp;#8217;t get Social Media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Max Neef told a story about his interest in  defining the single attribute that distinguishes humans from all other animals. He asked a teacher, who suggested it was the &amp;#8216;soul&amp;#8217;, but he wasn&amp;#8217;t convinced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next teacher he asked explained that humans have intelligence, but animals only have their instincts. But his experience with his own cat wouldn&amp;#8217;t let him accept this answer either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Max Neef forgot abut the question after that until an &amp;#8216;a-ha&amp;#8217; moment years later, when he realized that it must be &amp;#8216;humour&amp;#8217;. Two weeks later, he came across a paper by a Japanese expert in animal behaviour citing a species of birds who tell each other jokes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In University, over breakfast with his father–a brilliant scientist, it occurred to Max Neef that he&amp;#8217;d never put the question to him. So he did. His father said, &amp;#8220;try stupidity&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defining himself as a &amp;#8216;stupidologist&amp;#8217; (having studied the affliction for some time) he explained that stupidity describes not the lack of faculties, but having all the information you need and still making bad decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He went on to explain that we have created more information in the last 100 years than in all of history prior, and that decision-makers were still making the wrong decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#8217;s a big difference between having information and understanding it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He used love as an example to make the point, explaining that no matter how much empirical data we collect on the subject–social, chemical, etc–without ever being in love, you just won&amp;#8217;t &amp;#8220;get it&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the challenge facing organizations trying to leverage social networking platforms in their communications strategies today: You have to get bitten by the bug to use it effectively. But of course the irony is that when you do, your priorities change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week I&amp;#8217;ll list some tips for easing into it, even with your hectic schedule. In spite of your preconceived ideas about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: In case you don&amp;#8217;t know, today is Slow Food&amp;#8217;s Terra Madre Day. &lt;a href=&quot;http://slowfood.to/events/terra-madre-day-2011/&quot; title=&quot;Terra Madre Day 2011 with Slow Food Toronto&quot;&gt;Slow Food Toronto&lt;/a&gt; has put together an amazing list of producers, artisans and chefs for you and the family to meet and eat with (free) between 2 and 6 pm at Harbourfront.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/7918/ontario-lakes-project-lake-baptiste-lets-crash-the-party-ill-crash-the-plane/attachment/baptist&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-7926&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-7926&quot; title=&quot;baptist&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/baptist-580x356.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;356&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Ed Robertson, one of the Barenaked Ladies, crashed his float-plane Cessna 206 into Bancroft&amp;#8217;s Lake Baptiste way back in 2008 it turned out to be a pivotal moment for the band. The crash, coupled with other unfortunate events helped bring the band together. Speaking about the band&amp;#8217;s album &lt;a href=&quot;http://barenakedladies.com/music/all-good-time&quot;&gt;All in Good Time&lt;/a&gt; Robertson said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writing was cathartic for me in a way that writing hadn&amp;#8217;t been since the early nineties. It had been a huge and often dark year: an arrest, a plane crash and the death of my mother. All of these things took a heavy toll on my psyche, and spurred a lot of serious exploring.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  In fact, the Lake Baptiste crash inspired Robertson to write the following lyrics from the song &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkDv3MLHuyo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Love We&amp;#8217;re In &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  Less heart to heart, and more brain to brain&lt;br /&gt; If you&amp;#8217;re feeling tender, I&amp;#8217;m Novacain&lt;br /&gt; Lets crash the party, I&amp;#8217;ll crash the plane
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  We&amp;#8217;re certainly glad the Cessna passengers emerged unscathed, and that one of our favorite Canadian Bands emerged better than ever.
&lt;/div&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Desperate for a hit of caffeine this morning I stumbled into Starbucks. The red cups are out, and with them come the eggnog, gingerbread, and peppermint lattes. The holiday snacks, which are a million times better than the usual menu, gingerbread loaves, peppermint brownie cake pops, and my dearest friend the cranberry bliss bar. (I like to support indie coffee shops as much as I can but I will cut you for the last cranberry bliss bar.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/7825/the-most-wonderful-time-of-the-year/attachment/368e4259f85e467a928bd649d4d9f693&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-7896&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-7896 alignright&quot; title=&quot;368e4259f85e467a928bd649d4d9f693&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/368e4259f85e467a928bd649d4d9f693.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;146&quot; height=&quot;156&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;My favourite &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortheloveofcake.ca/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cupcake place&lt;/a&gt; has come up with a bunch of fantastic holiday related cupcakes. In less than a week my Dad will start his holiday baking, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/1160/simmerandstir-christmas-cake&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Christmas cake&lt;/a&gt; which is actually yummy; rich, crumbly golden &lt;a href=&quot;http://smittenkitchen.com/2008/10/twice-baked-shortbread-other-lost-recipes/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;shortbread&lt;/a&gt;; and a plum pudding with buttery hard sauce (butter, sugar, brown booze what isn&amp;#8217;t good about that?). I have two cookie baking party invites so far. Plates full of home made goodies are starting to appear in all kinds of unexpected places; even my hair salon has sugar dusted irresistible baked goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of all the yummy Christmas treats, there are also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.canadianliving.com/food/baking_and_desserts/hanukkah_treats__5_doughnut_delights.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hanukkah goodies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foiledagainchocolate.com/buy_coins&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chocolate coins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sweetcitycandy.com/Chanukah-Candy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dreidels&lt;/a&gt; full of smarties (so retro!), deep fried sweets, and the incredible &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.epicurious.com/articlesguides/holidays/hanukkah/todd-aarons-cocktail-party?intcid=epi_hptile2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gourmet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.epicurious.com/articlesguides/holidays/hanukkah/todd-aarons-cocktail-party?intcid=epi_hptile2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;variations&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/menus/hanukkah/2008/12/hanukkah_menu_guide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;potato latkes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

(Dear Body, I&amp;#8217;m sorry to try to obfuscate  your efforts to put on your winter weight, something the human body has been doing for thousands of years in this climate.) And the dire warning that the average person gains between 5-10 pounds over the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a fat kid, I snuck all the holiday treats I could smuggle back to my room, along with a crushing sense of guilt for wanting it and an incredible sense of glee for enjoying all of my bounty in a way that the adults in my life could never seem to let themselves. As an adult I still have that same sense of glee around the holidays (surprisingly 7 years in retail didn&amp;#8217;t kill it, I just have a moratorium on Christmas songs until December 20th.) And I&amp;#8217;m no longer going to feel bad around holiday food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on that note I&amp;#8217;m giving you the best holiday gift I can think of this year. The average person gains &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200003233421206&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;one pound&lt;/a&gt; over the holidays.  That&amp;#8217;s it. So stop worrying and feeling guilty around your special delicious food and enjoy it instead.  Happy Holidays!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;ve got a thing for Walleye, then Bamaji Lake in Sioux Lookout is where you want to be. Swimming in those waters are trophy walleye, measuring up to 32&amp;#8243;&amp;#8211;People, 32&amp;#8243; is the size of a a good sized flat screen TV. That&amp;#8217;s some fish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the name &amp;#8216;walleye&amp;#8217; has nothing to do with the positioning of the fishes&amp;#8217; eyes (even though the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Walleye&quot;&gt;urban dictionary&lt;/a&gt; uses it that way.) The name actually comes from the fact that, like lions, walleye&amp;#8217;s eyes reflect white light. This means they have a layer of pigment around their eyes which make them extra sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you want to catch a walleye as big as a big ol&amp;#8217; flatscreen TV, here&amp;#8217;s (according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.walleyecentral.com/articles/?a=208&quot;&gt;Walleye Central&lt;/a&gt;) what you need to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Because of their sensitivity to light, walleye bite best at dusk or at night&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Fall is the best time to catch walleye because they move more slowly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Use the lightest jig possible, yet one that is heavy enough to maintain contact with the bottom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Big minnows and big baits work best for bigger fall walleye&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re looking for a place to stay, Bamaji&amp;#8217;s fishing resort &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.knobbys.on.ca/&quot;&gt;Knobby&amp;#8217;s Fly In Fishing Camp&lt;/a&gt; is hands-down the place to be. In fact, as they say on their website &amp;#8220;If you haven&amp;#8217;t fished Knobby&amp;#8217;s you haven&amp;#8217;t fished!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What are you thankful for today? The gratitude app</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/what-are-you-thankful-for-today-the-gratitude-app/"/>
   <updated>2011-11-30T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/what-are-you-thankful-for-today-the-gratitude-app</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/7852/what-are-you-thankful-for-today-the-gratitude-app/attachment/1thing_1&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-7872&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-7872&quot; title=&quot;1thing_1&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/1thing_1-580x229.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;229&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://aylanewhouse.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ayla&lt;/a&gt; has been keeping a journal for more than 2 years to keep a record of things that she’s grateful for each day. She&amp;#8217;s noticed that this exercise has helped her maintain more positive attitude even in times of trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day she was talking about her daily exercise with Andrés, a friend of hers who works at a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theworkinggroup.ca/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;development shop&lt;/a&gt; here in Toronto. He thought this was a great idea and that it would be great as a portable app, so they decided to explore the possibility of taking the journal into the digital world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First it was a question of whether  people would actually be committed to write things they’re thankful for every day. They made a test group in which I participated; and started with a simple email reminder and a form in which we were asked to write six things each day for 21 days. At the end of each week they would send us statistics about the top things we were thankful for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me it felt like collecting stamps, I would not want to miss a day without filling that page with 6 things. At the end of the 21 days it definitely made me more conscious of the things I value the most in my life. Most of the people in the test group felt the same and decided to continue doing it. That’s when Ayla and Andrés decided to take it seriously and move forward developing 1 Thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/7852/what-are-you-thankful-for-today-the-gratitude-app/attachment/1thing_2&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-7873&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-7873&quot; title=&quot;1thing_2&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/1thing_2-580x225.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After being a witness to the whole process that it took to develop the app, I am happy to announce that 1 Thing launched last Thursday, strategically on American Thanksgiving Day, and is now available online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://1thingapp.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1THINGapp.com&lt;/a&gt;. There is nothing to download, and you can use it on a desktop or mobile phone with one account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you sign up you get a private “gratitude notebook” where you can start posting the things you’re thankful for. The app also features a public feed where users can share or look at other peoples’ postings. And it gives you the option of looking at your old postings by date so it becomes like a real online diary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have gotten used to being constantly bombarded with bad news.  What I find the most appealing about the 1 Thing app is that it takes our focus back to the positive things happening in our lives every day. I’m thankful for that.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Jane Austen on Smartphones</title>

   <id>http://getpoole.com/jane-austen-on-smartphones</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/social-media-category/7832/jane-austen-on-smartphones/attachment/screen-shot-2011-11-29-at-11-40-43-am&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-7834&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-7834&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-11-29 at 11.40.43 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-shot-2011-11-29-at-11.40.43-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;530&quot; height=&quot;330&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do people feel compelled to respond to the little messages coming through their phones *immediately *as if driven by compulsion?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIT Professor Sherry Turkle delivers the best description I&amp;#8217;ve ever heard when asked about this phenomenon in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/1716844/alone-together-an-mit-professors-new-book-urges-us-to-unplug&quot;&gt;Fast Company&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reminds me of how in Jane Austen, carriages are always coming, you&amp;#8217;re waiting, it could be Mr. Bingley&amp;#8217;s invitation to a ball. There&amp;#8217;s some sense that the post is always arriving in Jane Austen. There&amp;#8217;s something about email that carries the sense that &lt;em&gt;that&amp;#8217;s&lt;/em&gt; where the good news will come&amp;#8230;. I try to figure out what it is that this little red light means to people. I think it&amp;#8217;s that place for hope and change and the new, and what can be different, and how things can be what they&amp;#8217;re not now. And I think we all want that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can understand butterflies and excitement awaiting the prospect of an invitation where this might go down:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But face it, an Evite to a party you don&amp;#8217;t want to go to is not deserving of your undivided attention. The constant feeling of disappointment is much like the feelings Elizabeth Bennet expresses in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice&quot;&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/a&gt; upon George Wickhams&amp;#8217; departure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon the whole, therefore, she found what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire, did not, in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anticipation contained within the simple gesture of a vibrating phone can be so profound.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2011-11-25T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/state-of-emergency-at-attawapiskat-lake</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week as part of our Ontario Lakes Project series we created a blog post on &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/ontario-lakes-project/7645/watch-natives-do-their-thing-at-attawapiskat-lake&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Attawapiskat Lake&lt;/a&gt;.

   <title>Fur Trappings: Are you Buying the Green Fur Campaign?</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/is-wearing-fur-really-green-or-just-great-green-washing/"/>
   <updated>2011-11-25T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/is-wearing-fur-really-green-or-just-great-green-washing</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/7783/is-wearing-fur-really-green-or-just-great-green-washing/attachment/screen-shot-2011-11-25-at-1-19-59-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-7786&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-7786 aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-11-25 at 1.19.59 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-shot-2011-11-25-at-1.19.59-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;435&quot; height=&quot;634&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big sign on the QEW announced &amp;#8220;Fur Is Green.&amp;#8221; I don&amp;#8217;t often fall for &amp;#8216;teaser&amp;#8217; campaigns, but this one had my curiosity piqued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;ttp://www.furisgreen.com/&quot;&gt;The campaign&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.furcouncil.com/home.aspx&quot;&gt;Fur Council of Canada&lt;/a&gt; makes the case that fur is a sound environmental choice. The claim may or may not be true. But that&amp;#8217;s not why I&amp;#8217;m choosing to spend time thinking about it. I&amp;#8217;m more interested in pulling apart some of the rhetorical devices the Fur Council is using to make its case:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apples to Apples: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The campaign depends on measuring environmental impact of real animal Fur by comparing it to Faux Fur products made from petroleum:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real fur is an organic material. « Faux fur » (fake fur) and most synthetics are made from petrochemicals. Like other plastics, these materials do not break down easily and will remain in landfills for centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first it sounds compelling, but let&amp;#8217;s remember, not every person who opts out of wearing real fur goes out to get a faux fur coat in its place. There are may choices along the spectrum&amp;#8211;some more green then others, many more green than petroleum based faux fur. But this little rhetorical device does it&amp;#8217;s job rather well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/7783/is-wearing-fur-really-green-or-just-great-green-washing/attachment/screen-shot-2011-11-25-at-3-18-42-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-7811&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-7811 aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-11-25 at 3.18.42 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-shot-2011-11-25-at-3.18.42-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;271&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hudson&amp;#8217;s Bay Fur Outpost, Manitoba&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Historical Smoke and Mirrors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harkening back to a better, simpler time, the site talks about trappers, artisans and family farms as if not a minute has rolled by since Hudson&amp;#8217;s Bay set up shop:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fur trade also maintains centuries-old craft traditions: each fur garment is individually cut and sewn by skilled artisans. The men and women of the North American fur trade are proud of the skills and traditions they maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fur industry is an $800 million dollar industry in Canada and much has changed over the last 300 years. Getting an industry up to that scale requires streamlining and modernization methods that are generally not in the best interests of the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we all know that just something has been done for a long time does not mean it&amp;#8217;s something we want to continue doing today. Hello, anyone heard of slavery?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/7783/is-wearing-fur-really-green-or-just-great-green-washing/attachment/screen-shot-2011-11-25-at-1-25-56-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-7789&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-7789 aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-11-25 at 1.25.56 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-shot-2011-11-25-at-1.25.56-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;459&quot; height=&quot;293&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greedwashing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fur Council spends a lot of time letting you know that* other* organizations (namely non-profits like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.peta.org/&quot;&gt;Peta&lt;/a&gt;) are greedy, thereby positioning themselves as the insider/informant who by extension is not greedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their FAQ section they respond to the question &amp;#8220;are those videos I&amp;#8217;ve seen real?&amp;#8221; referring to videos of animal cruelty likely circulating on the internet. The answer is quite telling:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately there are many documented incidents of activist groups &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.furcommission.com/news/newsC7.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“staging” horrible videos to fuel their fund-raising drives&lt;/a&gt;. They do this because the stakes are high! Animal activist groups now rake in millions of dollars with sensationalized, media-driven campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmmm&amp;#8230;.I&amp;#8217;m willing to believe that there are unscrupulous non-profit organizations out there, but let&amp;#8217;s face it, the fur industry has a huge stake in convincing the public that fur is a &amp;#8220;good&amp;#8221; option. After all, even &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/26/business/fur-industry-shrinking-with-no-end-in-sight.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;src=pm&quot;&gt;Hudson&amp;#8217;s Bay &lt;/a&gt;closed its fur department in 1991. The New York Times said the choice was based on &amp;#8220;the relentless campaigning of animal rights advocates and plunging demand that began with the 1987 stock market crash.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today there are fur departments in selected Bay stores. To put it mildly,  let&amp;#8217;s just say the fur industry would like to keep it that way. In other words, if the stakes are high for PETA, they&amp;#8217;re even higher for the Fur Association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Infantilizing Anti-Fur Activists: *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;****In response to a FAQ question &amp;#8220;How can the use of animal to make a luxury product ever be ethical?&amp;#8221; the site provides this, rather humorous response:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us grew up with wonderful stories of Mama Bear and Baby Bear and we all love Bambi. But Nature is not Disneyland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow. I think it&amp;#8217;s fair to assume that Anti-Fur activists are concerned about much more than the loss of &lt;em&gt;cartoon-species&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are real concerns about the chemicals used to skin, produce and maintain fur once it&amp;#8217;s hit the store shelves. This is what PETA refers to as &amp;#8220;a soup of toxic chemicals.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, many of the concerns are about the treatment of animals, but of course it&amp;#8217;s not romanticized ideas about Bambi that are on the minds of animal activists. It&amp;#8217;s much more serious issues like factory farming, cruelty, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, it&amp;#8217;s hard to take animals out of the equation when thinking about fur. That&amp;#8217;s why the very line &amp;#8220;Fur is green&amp;#8221; is so provocative. But would it be worth evaluating fur on it&amp;#8217;s environmental merit&amp;#8211;as divorced from environmental issues? Is there any way you could be convinced that fur is green? I&amp;#8217;m (clearly) having a hard time being objective on this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ontario Lakes Project: Balsam Lake</title>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balsam Lake is Canada&amp;#8217;s Fresh Water Summit&amp;#8211;meaning it is the highest fresh water point in Canada from which you can circumnavigate the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thats right, from Balsam&amp;#8217;s humble shores a skipper with a seaworthy vessel could head east to the Atlantic Ocean, west to the Pacific, north to the Arctic Ocean or south to the Caribbean — without ever touching land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not clear whether anyone has actually sailed from Balsam to any ocean (never mind circumventing the globe), but the fact that you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; if you wanted to is still pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Fat. It&amp;#8217;s one of the last acceptable frontiers of &lt;a href=&quot;http://unboundstate.blogspot.com/2011/10/funny-fat-people-pictures.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hilarious&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://fupahunter.blogspot.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mockery&lt;/a&gt; (just take a look at how Rob Ford is often ridiculed, not for his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/andrew-reeves/rob-ford-budget-cuts_b_961330.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;terrible decisions and bad leadership&lt;/a&gt; but for his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shamelessmag.com/blog/2011/07/fatness-and-rob-ford/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;weight&lt;/a&gt;.) We&amp;#8217;re spending millions of dollars on fighting the so-called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/ResearchPublications/prb0511-e.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;obesity epidemic&lt;/a&gt;. The CBC declared it was aiding &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbc.ca/liverightnow/million-pound-challenge.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Canadians across the country&lt;/a&gt; in their battle against the bulge. They even had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbc.ca/liverightnow/village/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reality show&lt;/a&gt; about a whole town on a diet (and all of those people will have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weightymatters.ca/2011/01/cbcs-village-on-diet-episode-1-recap.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gained back all of that weight&lt;/a&gt; and potentially more in a mere 3-5 years because and feel free to say this with me because &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/08/110802125546.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Diets don&amp;#8217;t work&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2010 Americans (now the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/life/archive/2011/11/the-richest-fattest-nation-on-earth-its-not-the-united-states/248366/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;second fattest nation&lt;/a&gt; on earth) spent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessweek.com/debateroom/archives/2008/03/the_diet_industry_a_big_fat_lie.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;40 BILLION dollars&lt;/a&gt; on the diet industry. With their economy crumbling around them and unemployment the highest it&amp;#8217;s been in years, they still found a way to spend billions of dollars on weight loss and they&amp;#8217;re still the second fattest nation on earth. Cognitive dissonance anyone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a massive &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_desert&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;food desert&lt;/a&gt; in many places in North America. Many &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.studentsuccess.ca/theNeed.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;children go hungry&lt;/a&gt; in this &lt;a href=&quot;http://martinprosperity.org/insights/insight/food-deserts-and-priority-neighbourhoods-in-toronto&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;city &lt;/a&gt;and across this country every day and yet we&amp;#8217;re taught to find fat so &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/dating-blog/overweight-couples-on-television&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;repulsive&lt;/a&gt; we&amp;#8217;d rather spend money on making people skinny than feeding those hungry kids. We&amp;#8217;re starving our future. Does this make any sense to anyone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure, I&amp;#8217;m fat and not just a little. I&amp;#8217;m morbidly obese, (according the the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BMI&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;#8217;m death fat wheee! But has anyone updated &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2011/11/17/defining-fat/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+SociologicalImagesSeeingIsBelieving+(Sociological+Images:+Seeing+Is+Believing)&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the BMI &lt;/a&gt;since the 19th century, or figured out if it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106268439&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;really works&lt;/a&gt;? Hint: nope!) And for a long time doctors have been threatening me with all of the terrible things that are going to go wrong with me because of it. Everything from sprained ankles and knee problems to diabetes, and anything that did go wrong was easily solved if only I was willing to lose &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xojane.com/healthy/standing-your-doctor-about-fat-shaming&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;t&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xojane.com/healthy/standing-your-doctor-about-fat-shaming&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;he weight&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;.Because skinny people are always &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.naturallyintense.net/blog/fitness/being-skinny-does-not-mean-being-healthy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;completely and uniformly healthy&lt;/a&gt; all the time, they never have joint problems or any health related problems at all ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;But we&amp;#8217;re worried about your health&amp;#8221; is something I hear all the time. (This kind of behavior is know as &lt;a href=&quot;http://concerntroll.tumblr.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;concern trolling&lt;/a&gt; and it makes me a little bit crazy.) There are many fat people who are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haescommunity.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;in-shape and healthy&lt;/a&gt;.  If you were actually worried &lt;a href=&quot;http://jezebel.com/5561337/gym-deems-woman-too-fat-to-exercise?tag=fatshaming&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;about my health&lt;/a&gt;;  you&amp;#8217;d stop trying to &lt;a href=&quot;http://feministing.com/2010/09/09/fatslut-acceptance-and-the-meritocracy-myth/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;shame me&lt;/a&gt;, you&amp;#8217;re actually worried about my &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jezebel.com/5857466/desperate-for-attention-ashley-madison-releases-new-stupid-ad?tag=fatshaming&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;unattractive&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; &lt;a href=&quot;http://cypheroftyr.wordpress.com/2010/06/14/fat-shaming-and-concern-trolling-in-why-are-black-women-so-big/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fat&lt;/a&gt;. (If &lt;a href=&quot;http://danceswithfat.wordpress.com/2010/03/07/386170-unhelpful-things/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;shame worked as an&lt;/a&gt; incentive to be thinner I&amp;#8217;d weight about -300000 lbs)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me let you in on a little secret, humans have been &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.google.com/hosted/life/l?imgurl=a2d5cba460124b2e&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fat&lt;/a&gt; since &lt;a href=&quot;http://fuckyeaholdtimefatties.tumblr.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;forever&lt;/a&gt;, not just since the introduction of corn syrup into any all pre-packaged and processed food. Human bodies come in all kinds of wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;http://fatheffalump.wordpress.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;shapes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://http://danceswithfat.wordpress.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sizes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://globalcomment.com/2010/fat-and-disability-what-few-of-you-want-to-hear/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s one of the most beautiful things about the human body, our ability to be so incredibly different and yet so achingly similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we&amp;#8217;re doing right now isn&amp;#8217;t working. We  need to take a very close look at what we&amp;#8217;re doing to our&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fooddemocracy.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; food system&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fdu.edu/newspubs/magazine/99su/stress.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fdu.edu/newspubs/magazine/99su/stress.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;utomation of work&lt;/a&gt;, how &lt;a href=&quot;http://io9.com/388136/fast-food-joints-add-hormone-to-food-that-makes-you-want-to-eat-more&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;drugs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://envirocancer.cornell.edu/factsheet/diet/fs37.hormones.cfm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hormones&lt;/a&gt; in our food are affecting our metabolisms. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GMO&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GMOs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.helium.com/items/1317612-corporate-farming-enviromental-effects&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;corporate farming&lt;/a&gt;, and how our food has become much less &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rebuild-from-depression.com/blog/2007/05/nutrient_loss_in_the_food_supp.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nutritious&lt;/a&gt;. And we need stop celebrating a person&amp;#8217;s size and instead celebrate their work towards health no matter what their size or ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/7643/riots-not-diets/attachment/tumblr_ldf0o5gocr1qfybwpo1_400&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-7714&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-7714&quot; title=&quot;from www.concerntroll.tumblr.com&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/tumblr_ldf0o5GOcr1qfybwpo1_400.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Slavery Footprint &#8211; Made In A Free World</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/slavery-footprint-made-in-a-free-world/"/>
   <updated>2011-11-20T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/slavery-footprint-made-in-a-free-world</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slaveryfootprint.org/#&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/what.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Most of the folks we work with are conscious consumers to the degree that they&amp;#8217;re comfortable with. Food is an area that I&amp;#8217;ve been able to make major changes to my consumption habits in. In fact it was the account of the fast food industry&amp;#8217;s labour practices in Eric Schlosser&amp;#8217;s &lt;a class=&quot;zem_slink&quot; title=&quot;Fast Food Nation&quot; href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Fast-Food-Nation-Eric-Schlosser/dp/0395977894%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dhypenoticcom-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0395977894&quot; rel=&quot;amazon&quot;&gt;Fast Food Nation&lt;/a&gt; that made it easy to drop them off my menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Slavery Footprint (beautifully and) disarmingly helps you get your head around how many of your comforts, conveniences and distractions make you complicit in slavery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accuracy aside, one thing was clear from the well illustrated walk-through. The degree of learning we all have to do is only dwarfed by the changes we need to make. The entities that make their margins on the backs of slaves count on our dependence on maintaining the status quo. Inertia is dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slaveryfootprint.org/#&quot;&gt;Slavery Footprint &amp;#8211; Made In A Free World&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: There&amp;#8217;s an app for it too.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ontario Lakes Project: Watch natives do their thing at Attawapiskat Lake</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;mceTemp&quot;&gt;

    &lt;dt class=&quot;wp-caption-dt&quot;&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/ontario-lakes-project/7645/watch-natives-do-their-thing-at-attawapiskat-lake/attachment/attawapiskat&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-7669&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-7669&quot; title=&quot;attawapiskat lake&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/attawapiskat-580x361.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;361&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1991 &lt;a href=&quot;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-07-21/sports/9103210612_1_pickle-lake-outpost-thunder-bay&quot;&gt;The Chicago Tribune&lt;/a&gt;  called the sandy beaches of Attawapiskat Lake &amp;#8220;The Ultimate Getaway.&amp;#8221; A concept that the local Native population found downright absurd:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They shake their heads at the idea that their town -reachable chiefly by plane from Pickle Lake and Fort Hope 300 miles north of Thunder Bay- represents perfect isolation, the* ultimate getaway*, an ideal jumping-off place for a burgeoning Indian-based tourism industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8216;People would come here just to rent boats, read books, lay on the beach and walk around watching natives do their thing,&amp;#8217; a meeting of bemused Ojibway leaders is told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently Aboriginal Tourism is a growing field. A recently released report called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linkbc.ca/torc/downs1/AT_Development_NorthernOntario.pdf&quot;&gt;Aboriginal Tourism Development Strategic Plan for Northern Ontario&lt;/a&gt; concluded that &amp;#8220;more Aboriginal themed more demand-generating attactions are needed.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And apparently, laying around watching Natives do their thing counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The irony of calling Attawapiskat Lake the Ultimate Getaway was intensified when @susana066 from Charlottetown PEI shared shocking video about horrible state of living conditions the Attawapiskat peoples are currently experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please watch the video and sign &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thepetitionsite.com/takeaction/633/264/546/&quot;&gt;the petition &lt;/a&gt;asking the Minister of Indian Affairs to provide emergency funding for housing which is desperately needed as winter approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>It&#8217;s Lonely in a Self-Serve World</title>

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; grocery shopping, but I absolutely detest doing my own self-serve check out. It&amp;#8217;s not (just) that I&amp;#8217;m lazy, it&amp;#8217;s that it feels like such an empty experience. I&amp;#8217;ve never quite understood why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today on my way to get groceries at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fiestafarms.ca&quot;&gt;Fiesta Farms &lt;/a&gt;(our client) the sadness I feel when bagging my own started to make sense. CBC&amp;#8217;s Q featured New York Times columnist Craig Lambert who was talking about his article &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/opinion/sunday/our-unpaid-extra-shadow-work.html?pagewanted=all&quot;&gt;Our Unpaid Extra Shadow Work&lt;/a&gt;.  In it Lambert talked about all of the unpaid jobs we now do that someone else did ten years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider how self-serve gas stations, airports and grocery stores have off-loaded  tasks onto the consumer. Lambert focuses on fatigue as a consequence of all of the many extra tasks we now have to perform. But I think there&amp;#8217;s something much bigger at stake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, I&amp;#8217;m frustrated by the lack of service people I encounter when I&amp;#8217;m in a store and need to ask a question. No one works in these stores anymore. They&amp;#8217;re just there to take your money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why do I care? Am I looking to be pampered? Am I just spoiled?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to this question was clear to me as I chatted with Sara, Lucy and Vito at the Fiesta Farms checkout counter. We were talking about Fiesta&amp;#8217;s involvement in Movember and which male employees were and were not participating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/7648/its-lonely-in-a-self-serve-world/attachment/screen-shot-2011-11-16-at-2-48-30-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-7656&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-7656&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-11-16 at 2.48.30 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-shot-2011-11-16-at-2.48.30-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;418&quot; height=&quot;340&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fiesta Farm&amp;#8217;s Vito (who will help you get your bags to your car)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The banter may seem insignificant, but the human engagement and a sense of community I felt is not. In fact, it&amp;#8217;s core to the experience of shopping at Fiesta.  As Lambert states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing things for one another is, in fact, an essential characteristic of a human community. Various mundane jobs were once spread around among us, and performing such small services for one another was even an aspect of civility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without the chit-chat and human engagement life is quite lonely. What used to be social tasks are now performed with nothing but the voices in your head to keep you engaged. We&amp;#8217;re living a more and more isolated existence. Of course it&amp;#8217;s ironic given the proliferation of social media like Facebook and Twitter, but in self-serve moments it&amp;#8217;s palpable. &amp;lt;!--more--&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we were doing our background research on Fiesta Farms we did a review of the kinds of blog posts people wrote about the store. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.precisionnutrition.com/expert-profile-fiesta-farms&quot;&gt;One, by Krista Scott Dixon&lt;/a&gt; stood out. In her post she refers to small town grocery stores as &amp;#8220;community hubs&amp;#8221; and  says &amp;#8220;fifteen years later, I am immersed in that world again, every time I step into Fiesta Farms. &amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiesta has established a competitive advantage by *not *being self-serve (what Lambert calls a synonym for &amp;#8220;no service.&amp;#8221;) Other indie shops like my local hardware store make a point of circling the aisles asking &amp;#8220;can I help you with something?&amp;#8221;  I find that tremendously valuable. So valuable that I&amp;#8217;m willing to pay for it. And I bet I&amp;#8217;m not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But does service have to be relegated to high-end shops like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/opinion/sunday/our-unpaid-extra-shadow-work.html?pagewanted=all&quot;&gt;Holt Renfrew&lt;/a&gt; where you&amp;#8217;ll be bombarded by salespeople falling over themselves to serve you? Or is there a market for run of the mill experiences that refuse to cave into the cost-cutting self-serve trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you willing to pay for service, or are you just fine going about your own business? Do you notice the sense of isolation that comes with a self-serve world or am I just high maintenance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Marketing Genius: Fruit Label Dissolves into Organic Fruit Soap</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/marketing-genius-fruit-label-dissolves-into-organic-fruit-soap/"/>
   <updated>2011-11-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/marketing-genius-fruit-label-dissolves-into-organic-fruit-soap</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/7582/marketing-genius-fruit-label-dissolves-into-organic-fruit-soap/attachment/screen-shot-2011-11-11-at-10-22-23-am&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-7583&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-7583&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-11-11 at 10.22.23 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-shot-2011-11-11-at-10.22.23-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;392&quot; height=&quot;343&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Hypenotic we often talk about making sure what you create is useful and relevant. This boils down to the fact that it solves a problem for somebody and addresses their pain points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need a brilliant example? Enter &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.discovery.com/tech/fruit-label-dissolves-soap-111108.html&quot;&gt;Fruitwash stickers&lt;/a&gt;. This is so genius I can hardly stand it. Those stickers are a necessity for the checkout process, but oh-so annoying to the customer. I&amp;#8217;ll admit, I&amp;#8217;ve eaten my share of stickers only to discover the mishap later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast Fruitwash stickers dissolve into organic soap to remove pesticides from fruit and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re looking for inspiration about how to create meaningful marketing look no further then inventor Scott Amron who says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ve always been discontent with fruit labels and felt they could do more than just display product info and be difficult to peel off,&amp;#8221; Amron &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gizmag.com/dissolving-food-stickers-wash-fruit/20392/?utm_source=Gizmag+Subscribers&amp;utm_campaign=6039729856-UA-2235360-4&amp;utm_medium=email&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Gizmag. &amp;#8220;We buy, wash and eat fruit. So, the wash step was the next thing the label should help with.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How could you turn your &amp;#8216;must have&amp;#8217; communications into something that will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Meaningfully engage people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Help them do what they need to do anyway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Make sure a touch point takes away customer&amp;#8217;s pain points?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  In this regard, this little invention is pure genius. To read more, check out the article in&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.discovery.com/tech/fruit-label-dissolves-soap-111108.html&quot;&gt; Discovery News&lt;/a&gt;.

   <title>App-itize your Colour Inspiration</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/app-for-colour-inspiration/"/>
   <updated>2011-11-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/app-for-colour-inspiration</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When it comes time to choose a colour palette for a project, sometimes it&amp;#8217;s hard to get started. But as I discovered last weekend, you can find colour inspiration all around you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a sunny Sunday morning I became obsessed with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cliqcliq-colors/id291725775?mt=8&quot;&gt;Cliqcliq Colors app&lt;/a&gt;, which I downloaded ages ago and then forgot about. The app allows you to create colour palettes from scratch, from new photos, from photos in your library, or photos on flickr. I started taking pictures and testing it out, and I had so much fun seeing how each photo could be captured in palette form within seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-7592&quot; title=&quot;Cliqcliq_maple&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Cliqcliq_maple.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cliqcliq maple&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This app isn’t perfect by any  means. Sometimes the colours it draws from a photo don’t really seem to work together, and that’s when it might help to zoom in on specific areas. You can also edit each colour within the palette. Sometimes the chosen photo doesn&amp;#8217;t make a good colour scheme at all. But it’s so quick and easy you can always choose another photo and try again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-7593&quot; title=&quot;Cliqcliq_leaf&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Cliqcliq_leaf.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cliqcliq leaf&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are of course many sources for colour palettes online, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://kuler.adobe.com/#themes/mostpopular?time=30&quot;&gt;Kuler&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.colourlovers.com/&quot;&gt;Colourlovers&lt;/a&gt;, where you can create your own or browse through millions created by others. What I like about Cliqcliq, however, is that you can instantly create colour combinations from things in your surrounding environment, at the very moment you are inspired by them. Now every time I go for a walk I see the potential for colour palettes all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other well-known colour palette apps are &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/color-expert/id292243338?mt=8&quot;&gt;Color Expert&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://maddysoft.com/iphone/palettes/&quot;&gt;Palettes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have fun.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Astrolabe Lake</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/astrolabe-lake/"/>
   <updated>2011-11-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/astrolabe-lake</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/7552/astrolabe-lake/attachment/astrolabe2&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-7571&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-7571&quot; title=&quot;astrolabe2&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/astrolabe2-580x386.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Astrolabe Lake&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;386&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Astolabe Lake is where in 1867 a 14 year old Cobden, Ontario farmboy named Edward George Lee found Samuel de Champlain&amp;#8217;s long lost &lt;a href=&quot;http://astrolabes.org/&quot;&gt;Astrolabe&lt;/a&gt; presumably lost 254 years earlier.  At least that&amp;#8217;s what we&amp;#8217;ve been lead to believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The famed astrolabe is now in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.civilization.ca/home&quot;&gt;Canadian Museum of Civilization&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s permanent collection. It was acquired by The Department of Communications in 1989 from a New Yorker for $250,000. But poor Edward Lee never saw a cent of its value. Charles Overman, the captain of a local steamboat paid the boy 1 dollar, which Lee&amp;#8217;s father kept all to himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the astrolabe&amp;#8217;s monetary value, the veracity of the astrolabe&amp;#8217;s origins is important to a lot of folks. The lake (previously named Green Lake) was renamed for the famous find and there&amp;#8217;s a big &amp;#8216;ol plaque commemorating the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given all this, we seriously hope the fact-checkers knew what they were doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, apparently, the facts surrounding the providence of the astrolabe are not clear cut. In fact, there&amp;#8217;s good reason to believe that the object in question was never used by Mr. Champlain at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.mac.com/dwh5/Site/readings/Entries/2006/12/2_The_mystery_of_Champlain%E2%80%99s_Astrolabe.html&quot;&gt;detailed exploration of the matter&lt;/a&gt;, journalist and historian Douglas Hunter says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wondering if Champlain employed the Cobden astrolabe on the Upper Ottawa is like wondering if Mike Weir could drain a twenty-foot putt with a sand wedge during the Master’s. It might be doable with an awful lot of practice and some luck, but why on earth would Weir not just use a putter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words that particular astrolabe wouldn&amp;#8217;t be the right instrument for Champlain to use to navigate his canoe to the new world. This leads Hunter to conclude:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Flesh-and-blood Champlain may not have dropped the Cobden astrolabe, but a historic Champlain, a creature of modern imagination, deftly picked it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given all that he&amp;#8217;s contributed to Canadian history&amp;#8211;real and imagined&amp;#8211;we think it&amp;#8217;s only appropriate to pay homage to Edward George Lee, the young Cobden boy who found the astrolabe and who has been overshadowed by Champlain, who as far as we can tell, never even touched the thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a video produced by the Museum of Civilization about the Astrolabe when it was acquired in 1989&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why G+ is going to matter soon enough</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/why-g-is-going-to-matter-soon-enough/"/>
   <updated>2011-11-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/why-g-is-going-to-matter-soon-enough</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The eagerly anticipated launch of Google+ Business pages has so far been met with  resounding &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/social-media-category/7523/google-pages-launches-another-social-media-space-to-look-after&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;So what?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; And right now I&amp;#8217;d have to agree with that. The page set up is frustrating, the concept isn&amp;#8217;t new or innovative and frankly it&amp;#8217;s just another space for your community manager to post the same info as Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and Linked-In and Tumblr and Quora and possibly Storify, not to mention your blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As community managers we&amp;#8217;re going to need to come up with another twist on posting in yet another conversational space without recycling the same old thing. And this is essentially, what the protesting is about. We don&amp;#8217;t want to grow again because growth is hard especially in a space that is constantly asking for more. More information, more customer interaction, more transparency, deeper conversations, better ROI and we have to be funny, and we have to be topical and we have to be fast.  Faster than we&amp;#8217;ve ever been, not to mention keeping up with the changes that being in all of those spaces forces on us every two to three months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the reason for all of those changes? New social media networking platforms, or changes to the relevant player platforms. Evolution of one causes the whole group to change. Evolve or become irrelevant (my_space, friendster, hi-5).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so this is what leads me back to Google+ and how in a year from now (or even less) we&amp;#8217;ll all be using it and working on more innovative and creative ways to utilize it.  Because I am sure by then that Google will have found a way change it and grow it into a fabulous tool in the social marketing space.  (See Google reader, Gmail, Google docs, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wordstream.com/articles/google-failures-google-flops&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ignore Google wave, Google buzz&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we all appreciate good tools to get in on the conversation our customers are already having, don&amp;#8217;t we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/7539/why-g-is-going-to-matter-soon-enough/attachment/evolution-of-social-networking&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-7543&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-7543&quot; title=&quot;Evolution of Social Networking&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Evolution-of-Social-Networking-580x386.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;386&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Google Pages launches. Another social media space to look after.</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/google-pages-launches-another-social-media-space-to-look-after/"/>
   <updated>2011-11-07T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/google-pages-launches-another-social-media-space-to-look-after</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Google Pages launched today and I&amp;#8217;m already feeling a little tired.  A little social media saturated shall we say.  I mean how many social media properties do you really need?   How many can you properly curate at one time? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually I would be excited by this and be the first to jump in with both feet, but isn&amp;#8217;t it getting out of hand? If Google had come out with a completely new re-imaged, mind-blowing way of connecting people to businesses that is one thing, but it&amp;#8217;s the same old stuff. It&amp;#8217;s just another flavour of ice-cream. But that&amp;#8217;s the thing. Regardless of the flavour it is still just ice-cream. Facebook, Google+, Twitter, Linkedin and the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-7530&quot; title=&quot;social-network-similarities&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/social-network-similarities-580x295.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;295&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;So far Google+ has focused on connecting people with other people. But we want to make sure you can build relationships with all the things you care about—from local businesses to global brands—so today we’re rolling out Google+ Pages worldwide. For businesses and brands, Google+ pages help you connect with the customers and fans who love you. Not only can they recommend you with a +1, or add you to a circle to listen long-term. They can actually spend time with your team, face-to-face-to-face. All you need to do is start sharing, and you&amp;#8217;ll soon find the super fans and loyal customers that want to say hello.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmmm&amp;#8230;kinda sounds familiar, doesn&amp;#8217;t it? With a little copy editing this description could work for Facebook Pages or for Linkedin&amp;#8217;s Company Profiles or for the other 200 or so major social media spaces out there that offer branded pages for businesses.  I feel like we should pull a Steve Jobs on the social media landscape.  When Apple was only a couple of months away from bankrupcy, Jobs was brought back in to resuscitate the company. One of the first things he did was slash the 350 products that Apple was selling at the time down to 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quality not quantity was the answer. Instead of selling everything to everybody, cut the field down to a few, but make the few really, really great. And while we do that why not also take a page from what &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/technology/7267/prismatic-identity-social-networkings-next-challenge&quot;&gt;Chris Poole said at the Web 2.0 summit last month&lt;/a&gt; and re-imagine how social media works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair, I will probably play around with Google Pages and there will be a Pages company profile created. But today I think I&amp;#8217;ll stick with Louis C.K and get my head out of the screen and pick up the phone and talk to a client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Arrowhead Lake: a Foot Forager&#8217;s Fantasy!</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/arrowhead-lake/"/>
   <updated>2011-11-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/arrowhead-lake</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/7483/arrowhead-lake/attachment/arrowhead&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-7498&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-7498&quot; title=&quot;arrowhead&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/arrowhead-580x419.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;419&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arrowhead lake near lake Muskoka got its name from the aquatic plant that grows in its shallows. The Arrowhead plant (Sagittaria latifolia) also known as the &amp;#8220;indian potato.&amp;#8221;  This tuber was common in the native Canadian diet. In 1890 parts of Portland were said to provide at least 31,000 people with 20 per cent of the calories they needed for the year. An inexperienced person could harvest an estimated 350 tubers (about six pounds) in an hour. That&amp;#8217;s pretty impressive&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, the best way to harvest the aquatic tubers is to dig through the shallow water with your toes until the roots come floating to the top. This is how native women typically foraged for them in frigid waters in fall and winter&amp;#8211;when they&amp;#8217;re in harvest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out &amp;#8220;Wild Girl&amp;#8221; Becky Learner who in 2009 lived off of food foraged around Portland for a week. Here she is foraging for Arrowhead roots&amp;#8211;doing what she calls &amp;#8220;a joyous dance&amp;#8221; with some of her pals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wapatos were a major staple food of native Canadians and Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>DIY iSock</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/diy-isock/"/>
   <updated>2011-10-28T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/diy-isock</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    I was eating brunch with a friend the other day when she pulled out her iPhone, covered in a cute little iPod sock. It almost looked like a toque (very fitting for the chilly weather we’ve been having); it was pretty adorable. So I decided my iPhone should look equally cute.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    I keep putting off buying a case or any kind of screen protector, so why not a sock? Off I went to the Apple online store to check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.apple.com/ca/product/M9720G/B&quot;&gt;iPod socks&lt;/a&gt;. I discovered that they come in packs of six, for $39 ($45 with shipping). This seems like a bit much when you consider, they’re just socks. And they’re not even full socks. Really, each one is like half a sock. Would you pay $45 for three socks? So then I thought: &amp;#8220;I could make that.&amp;#8221; So I did.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    I found a stripey sock with the heel worn out (which I would’ve thrown out soon anyway) and transformed it into my very own iSock.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-7453&quot; title=&quot;DIY iSock&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0289.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;DIY iSock&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &amp;nbsp;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    How to make an iSock:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    1. Find a sock (when in doubt, look at your feet, and you may very well find one there).&lt;br /&gt; 2. Cut off the top 4.5” or so (depending on the size of your iPhone or iPod, and just leave enough for a seam).&lt;br /&gt; 3. Turn inside out.&lt;br /&gt; 4. Sew the cut edge together.&lt;br /&gt; 5. Sew in the side of the sock so that it’s tight enough to hold onto your iPod or  phone without slipping off.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Et voilà, you have an iPod sock! It’s ridiculously simple, right? And definitely not worth $45. Sure, it doesn’t have a fancy little Apple tag on it, but it does the trick, and if you recycle an old sock it will cost you a grand total of $0.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &amp;nbsp;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>&#8220;All Access&#8221; Triple Threat: McD&#8217;s, Cityline and Mom Bloggers</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/the-triple-threat-of-mcdonalds-cityline-and-mommy-bloggers/"/>
   <updated>2011-10-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/the-triple-threat-of-mcdonalds-cityline-and-mommy-bloggers</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t want to be* that person;  *That person who picks on the most obvious multinational for being greedy. That person who picks on moms who are entitled to their own values and just want to make a buck. So, I&amp;#8217;m going to try my hardest not to be that person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may be familiar with an initiative called &lt;a href=&quot;http://allaccessmoms.cityline.ca/mcdonalds-all-access-moms/&quot;&gt;McDonald&amp;#8217;s All-Access Moms&lt;/a&gt;, a partnership between &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.citytv.com/cityline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cityline&lt;/a&gt;, McDonalds and three Canadian &amp;#8220;Mom bloggers&amp;#8221; who won the chance to get a behind-the scenes look at McDonalds&amp;#8217; business practices. Here&amp;#8217;s what it says on the site:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selected as representatives of busy Canadian moms who eat on-the-go with their families and are curious to know how McDonald’s food is made and where it actually comes from, the three McDonald’s All-Access Moms will travel across the country armed with tough questions and a network of parents behind them looking forward to learning about their journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far the group has gone on three McDonald&amp;#8217;s excursions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  A trip to Chicago to meet &amp;#8220;Chef Dan&amp;#8221; who creates all of McD&amp;#8217;s recipes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  A potato farm in New Brunswick (where McD&amp;#8217;s french fries come from)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Cargill, a cattle farm in Alberta (where McD&amp;#8217;s beef comes from and one of the world&amp;#8217;s largest agribusiness players)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;#8220;All Access Tour&amp;#8221; is hosted b&lt;a href=&quot;http://allaccessmoms.cityline.ca/about-nanny-robina/&quot;&gt;y Nanny Robina, &lt;/a&gt;a Cityline parenting expert, and airs on Cityline. The findings from the tour are also featured on the McD&amp;#8217;s hosted All Access site. The mom bloggers also post about their McD adventures on their Twitter, facebook and blogs, sharing their findings with their mom communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#8217;t provide you with a listing of some of the insights the mommy bloggers have gleaned from the tour so far&amp;#8211;I&amp;#8217;ll let you read the blogs and tweets for yourself on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://allaccessmoms.cityline.ca/all-access-moms-blog/&quot;&gt;All Access Blog&lt;/a&gt; (I will admit I&amp;#8217;m using all my powers of self control here).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, let me just point out that the &amp;#8220;All Access Tour&amp;#8221; is built on a foundation of false transparency. The idea is &amp;#8220;we&amp;#8217;ll pull back the veil and give you a no holds barred view of McDonald&amp;#8217;s&amp;#8221;,  but of course there&amp;#8217;s nothing transparent about it. Yes, the some of the food comes from farms but that doesn&amp;#8217;t make it good.  The truth is that what McDonald&amp;#8217;s calls Grilled Chicken is actually this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boneless chicken breast meat, water, seasoning (salt, potassium chloride, trehalose, sugar, rice starch, hydrolyzed corn protein, flavour (autolyzed yeast extract, salt, disodium inosinate and disodium guanylate), spices, dextrose, garlic powder, autolyzed yeast extract, carrageenan, chicken fat, dehydrated cooked chicken powder, silicon dioxide, caramel, onion powder, corn maltodextrin), modified rice starch, sodium phosphates. Cooked on a grill lightly seasoned with trans fat free cooking spray (Canola oil, water, salt, hydrogenated cottonseed oil, soy lecithin, monoglycerides, potassium sorbate, artificial flavour and colour (annatto, turmeric), citric acid, vitamin A, vitamin D3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#8217;s just the tip of the iceberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not one of the All Access Moms will tell you this. This is because the deal between Cityline, McDonald&amp;#8217;s and Mommy bloggers is of course a &lt;em&gt;business&lt;/em&gt; arrangement. As one Toronto Star article featuring All Access mommy blogger Maureen Dennis (who in the interests of full transparency I know and have worked with) puts it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maureen Dennis, founder of seven-year-old Wee Welcome says it’s a matter of business. She has built a network of 40,000 members and has four staff to pay. Yet she’s frequently asked to share her insights and access for nothing, or in exchange for products. “I can’t pay my phone bill with free stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because this is a business relationship it cannot be considered free from business interests. There are terms to this employment relationship and those terms render the term &amp;#8220;All Access&amp;#8221; meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is to be done?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we blame Mommy bloggers for paying their bills&amp;#8211;even in an unscrupulous manner?  If their networks don&amp;#8217;t like how they behave, they can show their distain by leaving the community or making their opinions known. Can we blame McDonald&amp;#8217;s for being greedy and wanting to clean up their image, even in a way I think is repulsive? I wouldn&amp;#8217;t expect much more.  Can we blame Cityline for&amp;#8230;.??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After much consideration I actually believe that Cityline is the most culpable party in this whole arrangement. Cityline is complicit in creating a false sense of transparency&amp;#8211;the illusion of reality to that gives McDonald&amp;#8217;s promise &amp;#8220;All Access&amp;#8221; the edge it needs. After all, Cityline is a trusted media program with a responsibility to be an honest broker of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cityline is a key partner in the &amp;#8220;All Access&amp;#8221; triumvirate&amp;#8221;  because they  lend an air of  &amp;#8220;journalistic&amp;#8221; credibility to the entire endeavour. I find this shameful and beyond reproach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think about &amp;#8220;All Access Moms?&amp;#8221; If you were to write a petition or go after someone on a platform like&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.change.org/&quot;&gt; Change.org&lt;/a&gt; how would you  position the issue to direct action at the right party in all of this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d really appreciate your input on this because I&amp;#8217;d like to do something. I&amp;#8217;m just not sure what&amp;#8230;.yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    Allumette Lake isn&amp;#8217;t just any lake along the Ottawa River. This little body of water was the site of a &amp;#8216;majah&amp;#8217; scandal in 1613 where people were drowning in a sea of lies.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  Explorer &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_de_Vignau&quot;&gt;Nicholas de Vignau&lt;/a&gt; travelled with an Algonquin chief named&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessouat&quot;&gt; Tessouat.&lt;/a&gt; The two stopped at Allumet Lake where Tessouat told Vignau not to travel any further north because the tribes who resided there were &amp;#8220;evil sorcerers.&amp;#8221; Tessouat lied to Vignau (which he was in the habit of doing) to block travel north so he and his tribe could maintain control over trade with Quebec.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  Vignau went back to New France (Quebec) falsely boasting that he&amp;#8217;d travelled north and found the Northwest Passage (Hudson&amp;#8217;s Bay). In 1613 &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_de_Champlain&quot;&gt;Samuel de Champlain &lt;/a&gt;followed Vignau back to the site and discovered that Vignau was a boldfaced lier.  Champlain and Vignau encountered Algonquin chief Tessouat at Allumet Island where Champlain told Tessouat of Vignau&amp;#8217;s claim.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  Tessouat outed Vignau saying “If you visited those tribes, it was in your sleep.” In other words, in your dreams baby.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  Vignau was never heard from again. Tessouat  apparently told Champlain: &amp;#8220;Give him to us, and we promise you he will tell no more lies.&amp;#8221; All that Champlain wrote in his diary was: &amp;#8220;We left him in God’s keeping.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  Champlain gave up on finding the passage north and returned downstream.
&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>Lytro Takes a Bite from Apple</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/lytro-takes-a-bite-from-apple/"/>
   <updated>2011-10-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/lytro-takes-a-bite-from-apple</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-7335&quot; title=&quot;Lytro Red Camera&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Lytro-red-camera.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lytro Red Camera&quot; width=&quot;576&quot; height=&quot;368&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a sexy piece of technology and if you haven&amp;#8217;t already heard of the game changing Lytro cameras you will soon. Lytro just unveiled a line of &amp;#8220;light field&amp;#8221; cameras that capture more colour, intensity and light per shot than traditional cameras. That makes for more vibrant photos, but most importantly, it allows users to change the focus within an image after it&amp;#8217;s been taken. That&amp;#8217;s right, you focus &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; you&amp;#8217;ve taken the shot. (You can play around with how it all works on&lt;a title=&quot;Lytro Demo&quot; href=&quot;https://www.lytro.com/living-pictures/282&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Lytro&amp;#8217;s site&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The camera is elongated with a rectangular shape. The lens is on one end and a LCD touch-screen display on the other. Power and shutter buttons, a USB port, and a touch-sensitive strip to move through its 8X zoom range are arranged along the sides. It boasts 8 gigs of storage and comes in 3 colours. Oh yeah, one more thing, they&amp;#8217;ve included a social feature so that you can instantly share to Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-7341&quot; title=&quot;Lytro sticks out from the crowd&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/cm-capture-13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lytro sticks out from the crowd&quot; width=&quot;576&quot; height=&quot;366&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the revolutionary technology inside the camera, what is really striking is the design of the camera itself. The device looks nothing like a traditional point-and-shoot. It&amp;#8217;s simple, clean, user-friendly and well, Apple-esque. If it had a metallic casing and the Apple icon you might even think that is was part of the Apple product lineup. Even browsing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lytro.com/&quot;&gt;Lytro&amp;#8217;s site&lt;/a&gt;, you can see elements of Apple in the sites use of colours, whitespace, gradients and simple actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aesthetically pleasing objects appear to the user to be more effective, by virtue of their sensual appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like Apple, you can see the thought that went into the design and how we might want/need to interact with it. It&amp;#8217;s not only a product based on the principles of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_Design&quot;&gt;emotional design&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s also a company that seems to have adopted and pushed Apple&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Think Different&amp;#8221; mantra into the photography space. And like the iPad, a product we didn&amp;#8217;t know we needed until we held it in our hands, Lytro seems to have achieved the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To capture the complexity of &amp;#8220;light field&amp;#8221; technology and place it within a simple design is a pretty amazing thing. And as Steve Jobs said, &amp;#8220;simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Ontario Lakes Project: Ahmic Lake</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/the-ontario-lakes-project-ahmic-lake/"/>
   <updated>2011-10-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/the-ontario-lakes-project-ahmic-lake</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/7291/the-ontario-lakes-project-ahmic-lake/attachment/ahmik&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-7292&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-7292 aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;ahmic lake&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/ahmik-580x753.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;753&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahmic Lake&amp;#8217;s is a swimmer&amp;#8217;s lake. And the most famous swimmer to emerge from those waters was a brainy, beautiful and eccentric distance swimmer named Marty Sinn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  Marty learned her chops at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.campakomak.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Camp Ak-O-Mak&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8211;a girls only competitive sports camp on Ahmik Lake. Ak-O-Mak&amp;#8217;s unofficial camp motto was &amp;#8220;Lady, if you want your daughter to sew beads on a belt, send her somewhere else.&amp;#8221; And Marty wasn&amp;#8217;t your average &amp;#8216;lady.&amp;#8217;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  A &lt;a href=&quot;http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1076274/index.htm&quot;&gt;1964 edition of Sports Illustrated &lt;/a&gt; pointed out Sinn&amp;#8217;s eccentricity: &amp;#8220;At Ak-O-Mak she is forever wandering about like Hamlet with her nose in a book. Two days before the race she was lounging on the sun deck with a copy of &lt;em&gt;Mad&lt;/em&gt; magazine and a well-chewed paperback edition of &lt;em&gt;The Brothers Karamazov&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  In fact, Marty went on to say:
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m suspicious of people who are terribly gung-ho about all phases of athletics—diet, sleep. I eat chocolate ice cream before a race, blueberry pancakes and chocolate cake&amp;#8230;I&amp;#8217;m a little critical of people who train so intensely—they become machines instead of people, they become masochists. I just don&amp;#8217;t believe in it. It&amp;#8217;s detrimental to your character later, naturally, and to the sport, too. Obsessions can become vicious. You get so wrapped up, you lose perspective. I think parties are important, for instance. Sometimes I won&amp;#8217;t have anything to drink, but sometimes I really get in the bag.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  Parties didn&amp;#8217;t stop Marty from finishing second in the 24K CNE Lake Ontario Swim in 1963 and from being the first woman to complete the 36K &amp;#8220;Around the Island Swim&amp;#8221; in Atlantic city in 1964.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    Camp Ak-O-Mak is still alive and well on Ahmic Lake. Together with its boy&amp;#8217;s camp (also on Ahmic) it has trained over 60 men and women to be Olympians.
  &lt;/div&gt;

   <title>Prismatic Identity: Social networking&#8217;s next challenge</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Chris Poole knows a thing or two about how people behave online. He founded free-form free for all net sensation &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4chan.org/&quot; title=&quot;4chan&quot;&gt;4chan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://canv.as/&quot; title=&quot;Canvas&quot;&gt;Canvas&lt;/a&gt;. Don&amp;#8217;t click the links if you don&amp;#8217;t want to get stuck somewhere or question your sanity/sense of humour/values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this video from the&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.web2expo.com/webexsf2011&quot;&gt; web 2.0&lt;/a&gt; summit in San Francisco that social networks that let us choose which facet of our personalities and/or interests we want to share will get online identity right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree. I have friends who have 5 twitter accounts on which they interact with different audiences around often wildly different subject matter. Twitter makes it easier to disassociate your interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I have clients still wrapping their heads around ways to use Facebook personally without overly influencing the way their brand is perceived on their Fan Page. Not that they&amp;#8217;d do anything horrible online. But politics, religion, stances on or interests in specific social issues, they feel, can be inappropriate associations for their brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris suggests that Google Plus and Facebook both need to give users more control over context. The video is 8 minutes, but worth watching. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>5 Lessons to Savour from Foodstock</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/5-lessons-learned-from-foodstock/"/>
   <updated>2011-10-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/5-lessons-learned-from-foodstock</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/7283/5-lessons-learned-from-foodstock/attachment/screen-shot-2011-10-19-at-4-28-57-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-7288&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-7288&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-10-19 at 4.28.57 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Screen-shot-2011-10-19-at-4.28.57-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;569&quot; height=&quot;539&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s no doubt about it. Foodstock was a rip-roaring success. By various accounts anywhere between 20 and 30,000 people were in attendance&amp;#8211;eating, drinking and raising much needed funds to fight &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.highlandcompanies.ca/&quot;&gt;Highland Companies&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216; proposed quarry. The event also brought an unbelievable amount of awareness to the proposed quarry and the risk it poses to the environment, agriculture, water and health of communities across Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chefdb.com/nm/143/&quot;&gt;Michael Stadtlander&lt;/a&gt; set an attendance goal of 20,000, and up to a week before the event organizers were secretly saying they hoped that 5-10,000 people would attend. No one could have anticipated the number of&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/barrymartin/6254183958/in/set-72157627915040850&quot;&gt; muddy wellies&lt;/a&gt; trudging through the forest last weekend.  But once you consider the strategic steps employed around stopping the megaquarry, the results are no surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the 5 most important lessons to be learned from Foodstock&amp;#8217;s success:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt; A Staged Process:&lt;/strong&gt; In the months leading up to Foodstock, awareness events were built around specific thoughtfully articulated issues. &lt;a href=&quot;http://goodfoodrevolution.wordpress.com/2011/07/07/chefs-join-fight-against-melanchton-mega-quarry/&quot;&gt;The first event at Marben&lt;/a&gt;, was focused on food and the implications the quarry would have on our local food supply. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://nomegaquarry.ca/downstream-downtown-part-ii/&quot;&gt;second event at Patagonia was about the potential impacts on our water.  &lt;/a&gt; Rather than throwing out all the issues at once (and seeing what stuck) each issue was given its due and as a result those who participated walked away with a deeper understanding of what&amp;#8217;s at stake and the urgency of getting involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; *&lt;em&gt;Engage Communities of Interest: *&lt;/em&gt;At each of the gatherings there was a healthy mix of non-profit leaders, intellectuals, members of the media, bloggers, community advocates, representing a range of issues. Heck, Barry and I were even invited. The organizers thought about all of the groups who could possibly care about the mega quarry and built relationships with them, one at a time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; *&lt;em&gt;Create Short Term, Achieveable Goals: *&lt;/em&gt;Rather than conveying the knee-jerk &amp;#8220;No Mega-Quarry&amp;#8221; message at the outset, the initial thrust of the effort was focused entirely on ensuring that Highland Companies were required to undertake an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/story/2011/09/02/quarry-ontario-enviornmental.html&quot;&gt;environmental assessment&lt;/a&gt; before moving forward with their proposed quarry. When this happened it was a clear win for the issue and created the momentum  needed to make Foodstock a real celebration and a sign that we could collectively make a difference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; *&lt;em&gt;Have Fun: *&lt;/em&gt;Imagine this was a traditional protest instead of a concert and food festival. How many people would have shown up  (in the rain) with placards in hand? The fun-factor made the event appealing to a much wider constituency who aren&amp;#8217;t the usual activist suspects. A gathering at French&amp;#8217;s Farm where chefs served up delicious local food under the forest canopy reminded everyone what&amp;#8217;s at stake. And the music of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wasteyourdaysaway.com/&quot;&gt;Hayden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jimcuddy.com/&quot;&gt;Jim Cuddy,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sarahharmer.com/&quot;&gt; Sarah Harmer &lt;/a&gt;and members of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://barenakedladies.com/&quot;&gt;Barenaked Ladies&lt;/a&gt; warmed the cold and soggy crowd and made Foodstock feel like a modern day protest. At one point Hayden reminded everyone not to &amp;#8220;Eat the brown crème brû&lt;em&gt;lé&lt;/em&gt;e.&amp;#8221; We can fight for change and have a good time at the same time, can&amp;#8217;t we?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; *&lt;em&gt;Give People the Tools they Need: *&lt;/em&gt;Upon arrival at Foodstock every person was handed a brightly coloured envelope for donations. The crowd was reminded from the stage that the fight was just beginning and that people needed to chase down their MP&amp;#8217;s and let them know that the quarry needs to be stopped. You need to give people tools. People have good intentions but the right tools help them get the job done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>The Birthday gift that changed the world</title>

    Hayden plays at Foodstock
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Jodi bought my ticket to Foodstock. It was the pay-what-you-can event to raise funds to use in efforts to stop the proposed Melancthon Mega-quarry from being built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foodstock was a whole lot more than a fundraiser though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;span style=&quot;direction: ltr;&quot;&gt;It was a massive display of citizens playing their role in society&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;span style=&quot;direction: ltr;&quot;&gt;It attracted 30,000 people&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;span style=&quot;direction: ltr;&quot;&gt;The crowd was an amazingly diverse make-up crossing culture, age, industry and political lines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;span style=&quot;direction: ltr;&quot;&gt;Many participants came from outside of the region–in many cases, from out of the province&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Local chefs, many of whom give their energy to several causes during the course of the year, trucked their gear through mud, rain and serious wind to set up in the forest, preparing treats for line-ups of chilled, hungry revelers in less than ideal conditions. They did it with smiles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Local musicians &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cufftheduke.ca/&quot; title=&quot;Cuff the Duke&quot;&gt;Cuff the Duke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lilyfrost.com/&quot; title=&quot;Lily Frost&quot;&gt;Lily Frost&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mgmtrust.ca/producers/jose-contreras/&quot;&gt;Jose Contreras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jimcuddy.com/&quot; title=&quot;Jim Cuddy&quot;&gt;Jim Cuddy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wasteyourdaysaway.com/news.html&quot; title=&quot;Hayden&quot;&gt;Hayden&lt;/a&gt;, members of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://barenakedladies.com/home&quot; title=&quot;barenaked ladies&quot;&gt;Barenaked Ladies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://viamusicprogram.com/who_we_are.html&quot;&gt;Tom Barlow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sarahharmer.com/&quot;&gt;Sarah Harmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ronsexsmith.com/&quot;&gt;Ron Sexsmith&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.loonchoir.com/main.html&quot;&gt;Loon Choir&lt;/a&gt; risked electrocution and hypothermia to electrify a crowd&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the title of the post wasn&amp;#8217;t just link-bait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.commondreams.org/view/2011/10/07-0&quot; title=&quot;Naomi Klein&amp;#39;s address to Occupy Wall Street&quot;&gt; Occupy Wall Street&lt;/a&gt; movement, Foodstock is part of an attempt to help people, politicians and industry envision alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last 60 years, increasingly short-term profit has been the guiding hand influencing our economy. That&amp;#8217;s silly. Anything worth having takes time and effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alice Walker aptly said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most common way people &lt;em&gt;give up&lt;/em&gt; their &lt;em&gt;power&lt;/em&gt; is by thinking they don&amp;#8217;t have any.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too many people put up with the status quo because they don&amp;#8217;t envision the alternative, and that they can have a hand in creating it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the movie &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bluegold-worldwaterwars.com/&quot; title=&quot;Blue Gold&quot;&gt;Blue-Gold&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; about the degree to which Water Corporations (the new Oil companies) have embedded themselves and taken over civic water supplies around the world, I learned about the uprising in Bolivia that ultimately led to the ousting of the &lt;a class=&quot;zem_slink&quot; title=&quot;Bechtel&quot; href=&quot;http://www.bechtel.com&quot; rel=&quot;homepage&quot;&gt;Bechtel Corporation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bolivians didn&amp;#8217;t even have rights to collect rain water. They were thirsty, angry and got organized. Locals in Cochabamba, led by a young machinist revolted, resulting in new consideration for rights to water in their charter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process required  the death of a 17 year old (shot in the face), people blinded by tear gas, all manner of injuries, fear mongering and homes of organizers ransacked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately however, the Bolivian Government broke a 200 million dollar contract on a public water system with foreign investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If shareholders knew that all this was required to deliver their quarterly returns, would they still want the money?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe. But I, and the 30,000 folks who participated in Foodstock this weekend have a glass-half full mentality. We figure that awareness is a critical step in designing economies that sustain instead of exploit. Countries around the world are living the lessons of privatization of soil, water and their other most valuable resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s act on these lessons while our glass is indeed half full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, here are some pics from the event: http://hypn.tc/pGPc67&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Barry &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beaus.ca/&quot;&gt;Beau&amp;#8217;s Beer &lt;/a&gt;prototype has arrived! It was &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/5121/choose-the-new-face-of-beaus-beer-caps&quot;&gt;way back in the spring&lt;/a&gt; when Barry bid on and won the brilliant Beau&amp;#8217;s auction item in support of one of our favourite organizations &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.notfarfromthetree.org/&quot;&gt;Not Far From the Tree&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we&amp;#8217;re so close we can feel it&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gorgeous prototype just hit the Beau&amp;#8217;s Brewery production line. That means we&amp;#8217;re just weeks away from being able to buy it in stores. The Barry Beau&amp;#8217;s Beer bottles will be available for purchase at the LCBO starting in early November. Barry&amp;#8217;s face will adorn bottles of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beaus.ca/beer/lug_tread&quot;&gt;Lug Tread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beaus.ca/beer/seasonals/night_marzen&quot;&gt;Night Marzen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beaus.ca/beer/seasonal/bog_water&quot;&gt;Bog Water&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will lots more fun announcements when we can get a mug of this mug, but in the meantime, have a look-see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/juliemarie1/3295577996/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Agnew Lake&lt;/a&gt; is located just outside of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudbury_Ontario&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sudbury, ON&lt;/a&gt;.  It was created completely by accident in the early 1920&amp;#8242;s when &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INCO&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;INCO&lt;/a&gt; (International Nickel Company of Canada) put a power dam into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_River_(Ontario)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Spanish River&lt;/a&gt;.  This caused the river to flood and form Agnew Lake. It is named after &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=a1ARTA0000060&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;John Lyons Agnew&lt;/a&gt; who was the President of the company at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The area around the lake supported 5 diamond mines until the mid-1980&amp;#8242;s; even though originally the area was to be mined for uranium. Uranium mining didn&amp;#8217;t start until the late 70&amp;#8242;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agnew Lake is an excellent fishing lake which supports healthy populations of Smallmouth Bass, Channel Catfish, Northern Pike, Walleye, Whitefish and Perch.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to design 100 album covers and not die trying</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/how-to-design-100-album-covers-and-not-die-trying/"/>
   <updated>2011-10-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/how-to-design-100-album-covers-and-not-die-trying</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/7109/how-to-design-100-album-covers-and-not-die-trying/attachment/archive&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-7120&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-7120&quot; title=&quot;album archive&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/archive.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;593&quot; height=&quot;769&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend I finished a personal project called &lt;a href=&quot;http://angelykke.tumblr.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;100 songs 100 designs&lt;/a&gt; which I started back in April this year. The project was inspired by a workshop taught at the Yale School of Arts in which students had to choose one design exercise and repeat it for a hundred continuous days. I decided to take on the challenge designing an album cover for a new song each day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The rules:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Never having heard the song before&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Only use songs released in 2011&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Never repeat bands or artist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Never spend more than a day on it: upload deadline 12 am&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Objectives:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To gain a deep understanding of myself as a designer identifying my habits, common places, limitations and possibilities while discovering new music. To create enough content to pump up my design portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also needed to generate some certainty for myself. When I started this I was working from home and had some freelance projects here and there but it wasn’t enough to keep me really entertained. The 100-album project became my everyday routine, the thing I would wake up in the mornings for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ever want to try a challenge like this here’s some of the things I learned and I would recommend:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Be disciplined but flexible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If the project becomes a burden to yourself or if it&amp;#8217;s unrealistic it will be harder to finish. The first week I was very disciplined and worked on the covers from Monday to Sunday but found myself running back home from a bar at 11.30 pm on a Saturday night in order to design and upload the cover before the day ended. I managed to deliver in time but realized it was a good idea to have at least a day off. This is &lt;a href=&quot;http://angelykke.tumblr.com/post/4485306358/mindkilla&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the cover&lt;/a&gt; I did in 15 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Be autobiographical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Emotions, thoughts, frustrations and every day experiences are the best creative fuel and when you add music to the mix, ideas come flowing easy. &lt;a href=&quot;http://angelykke.tumblr.com/post/4615417615/day11&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;This cover&lt;/a&gt; happened right after being completely crushed in a job interview.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt; Get inspired, reinterpret&lt;/strong&gt; A lot of times the album cover would be heavily influenced by from the song’s video, the official cover, a live performance or the lyrics. I also spent time looked at classic album covers from all eras either on the record store or in sites like &lt;a href=&quot;http://sleevage.com/&quot;&gt;http://sleevage.com/&lt;/a&gt;  But there are also external influences all the time; for example &lt;a href=&quot;http://angelykke.tumblr.com/post/4642206850/day12&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this cover&lt;/a&gt; was designed after going to the movies to watch Scream 4. I was also still upset about the job interview from the previous day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Build an archive &lt;/strong&gt;Take pictures of everything you find interesting (or lame), you never know when you’re going to use them. Most of the pictures I used for the album covers were taken by me over the past 4 years. My father also contributed considerably with an awesome photographical archive that he digitalized from family pictures from the 80s and 90s (the aesthetic is so good!). See if you can find my kindergarten picture turned album cover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Find your limits and cross them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I tried to do everything myself and to get away from the computer as much as possible so I experimented with watercolor, handwriting, crayons, collage etc. I would also write everything that crossed my mind while listening to the song before designing or sketching. Sometimes for a change of perspective I imagined stepping outside myself and pretending I was someone else, perhaps someone in another country or in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://angelykke.tumblr.com/post/5534889745/day37&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;different time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Share your work!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Don’t be afraid of being criticized, if you are creating content for yourself that’s super valuable. For me it was great to have a project that I felt passionate about because I had so much to say about it in interviews or in conversations. I opened a tumblr account, I tweeted about it every day, shared it on facebook and I’m even writing a blog about it right now!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;One project will lead you to the next one&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We’re starting a new project here at Hypenotic called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/7027/introducing-the-ontario-lake-project&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ontario Lakes Project&lt;/a&gt; in which I’ll be designing an identity for a lake every week, we’ll also be sharing some information about sustainability, travel and culture related to each lake. That will keep me going for a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the 100 songs 100 designs project I would like to continue, organize an exhibit, print a book and eventually get hired to design a real album cover. Anyone interested?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Thanks to everyone who followed the blog, sent me new great songs, great feedback, shared my work and encouraged me all through the way. You know who you are.*&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>4 Reasons Not to Waste Time with Social Media</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/4-reasons-not-to-waste-time-with-social-media/"/>
   <updated>2011-10-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/4-reasons-not-to-waste-time-with-social-media</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/7098/4-reasons-not-to-waste-time-with-social-media/attachment/screen-shot-2011-10-11-at-4-14-50-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-7102&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-7102&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-10-11 at 4.14.50 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Screen-shot-2011-10-11-at-4.14.50-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;606&quot; height=&quot;474&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing kills a caffeine-fuelled jam session about all the ways a client could be rocking the social media world more than &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; little question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;How will I ever find the time to do all of this social media stuff when I&amp;#8217;m already overextended trying to make my business a success?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That always brings things to an abrupt halt. Buzz. Kill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course it&amp;#8217;s a very fair question&amp;#8211;otherwise so many people wouldn&amp;#8217;t ask it. The good news is we have some perfectly good answers that will help keep your social media mojo alive after the caffeine wears off:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;You&amp;#8217;re either marketing or you&amp;#8217;re not&lt;/strong&gt;: Hopefully we&amp;#8217;re not in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097351/&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;if you build it they will come&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; phase of your business and &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; that you need to do &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; kind of marketing or communications to help spread your idea or brand. We all agree that you can do this in many ways&amp;#8211;flyers, networking, magnets, writing a book, running print ads&amp;#8211;or all of the above. No matter what you opt to do you&amp;#8217;ll need to spend time and/or money to spread the word. Just because the social media platforms you&amp;#8217;ll use are free don&amp;#8217;t be fooled into thinking you won&amp;#8217;t need to invest in making that real estate meaningful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; *&lt;em&gt;Be Strategic: *&lt;/em&gt;Jumping in head first and using social media tools as a way to push out messages is guaranteed waste of time, and time is something that&amp;#8217;s in short supply. MBA&amp;#8217;s learn that efficiency comes when you &amp;#8220;plan the work and work the plan.&amp;#8221; Same rules apply to social media. You need to figure out what you can be sharing that others could care about, find your communities of interest and learn how to be a useful and relevant member of the community. Building relationships takes time, learning new skills takes time. There&amp;#8217;s no way around it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; *&lt;em&gt;Realize you&amp;#8217;re on a fascinating voyage (Just slide, slide, slippity slide): *&lt;/em&gt;I&amp;#8217;m guessing you read online, you meet cool people, you see awesome stuff. The stuff that you do everyday is the stuff of social media.&lt;em&gt; That&amp;#8217;s&lt;/em&gt; what you can be sharing. I&amp;#8217;m not going to pretend it doesn&amp;#8217;t take time to edit a video, post a photo or write a blog (if you&amp;#8217;re stuck on this point please go back to step #1). But you don&amp;#8217;t have to make up content. The content will practically write itself once you know the filter you&amp;#8217;re going to apply when you look out at the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; *&lt;em&gt;It&amp;#8217;s Scalable. *&lt;/em&gt;It&amp;#8217;s easy to think you have to do everything all at once and to become overwhelmed by all of the possibilities that social media represents. But social media is an entirely different beast than traditional media where the process of going from creative brief to fully executed campaign is tantamount to blowing your wad. Social media is more a slow drip where you determine the flow. What you decide to share is ever evolving as your business and your interests evolve. How much you share can fluctuate as your business fluctuates. Communities understand that. But first you need to build community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Ontario Lakes Project: Lake Abitibi</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/water-week-1-lake-abitibi/"/>
   <updated>2011-10-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/6998/water-week-1-lake-abitibi/attachment/abitibi&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-6999&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft&quot; title=&quot;Lake Abitibi&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/abitibi.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;373&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The name Abitibi is an Algonquin word meaning &amp;#8220;middle waters&amp;#8221; (&lt;em&gt;abitah&lt;/em&gt; ‘middle’ and &lt;em&gt;nipi&lt;/em&gt; ‘water&amp;#8217;) because the lake is situated between Hudson&amp;#8217;s Bay and the Ottawa River&amp;#8211;the midway point for canoes travelling between these two key points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today Canadian wild sturgeon caught in Lake Abitibi are the source of Canada&amp;#8217;s best, sustainable alternative to caspian caviar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a video &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b71HDsGpU4s&quot;&gt;of a very determined and chilly fellow&lt;/a&gt; ice fishing and catching pike in Lake Abitibi (jump to 2:13 to witness the big catch)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Introducing the Ontario Lakes Project</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/introducing-the-ontario-lake-project/"/>
   <updated>2011-10-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/introducing-the-ontario-lake-project</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/7027/introducing-the-ontario-lake-project/attachment/ontario-lakes-project-1&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-7067&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-7067&quot; title=&quot;ontario-lakes-project-1&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/ontario-lakes-project-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;521&quot; height=&quot;471&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some time now much of Hypenotic&amp;#8217;s work and our volunteer efforts have been connected to food, sustainability, travel and culture. Over the summer an idea bubbled up; what if we made promotional gear for Ontario places that people would actually want to wear or frame on their wall?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then two critical things happened. First, we became &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/6657/were-helping-stop-the-quarry&quot;&gt;involved in working to stop the proposed Mega Quarry in Melancthon County&lt;/a&gt; and in the process developed a better understanding of the food and water issues that are at stake. Around the same time we came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.branding10000lakes.com/&quot;&gt;Nicole Meyer&amp;#8217;s 10,000 Lakes&lt;/a&gt; initiative where she is creating a logo for a different Minnesota lake every day. Along the way we heard &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.canadians.org/about/Maude_Barlow/&quot;&gt;Maude Barlowe&lt;/a&gt; speak, watched the documentary &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flowthefilm.com/&quot;&gt;Flow &lt;/a&gt; and started to think about water a little differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lakes_of_Ontario&quot;&gt;Wikipedia search&lt;/a&gt; revealed that Ontario has less than 10,000 Lakes, but we have enough of &amp;#8216;em to warrant giving them the love they deserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week we are starting with Lake Abitibi, the first lake in the alphabetical list. Every week we will work our way down the list creating a new logo for each lake to give you a new perspective on this amazing province we live in and the incredible resource that is water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;zemanta-img&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em; display: block;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;attachment_14267&quot; style=&quot;width: 347px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;
    &lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 0.3125em; line-height: 2.4em;&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/5129ZJNH7EL.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-14267 &quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/5129ZJNH7EL.jpg&quot; width=&quot;337&quot; height=&quot;475&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
      Image via Wikipedia
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I threw out my daughter&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Barbie-12-Dancing-Princesses-Colouring/dp/1405226471&quot; title=&quot;Barbie colouring book&quot;&gt;Barbie coloring book&lt;/a&gt; this morning while she wasn&amp;#8217;t looking. I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure it&amp;#8217;s recyclable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, as my wife and I leafed through the pages, we were dismayed that all the images were of what Barbie was wearing, the makeup in her purse and the parties she was going to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was all about the glamour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all can use a bit of glamour in our lives, of course. But it&amp;#8217;s supposed to be the icing on the cake, not the cake itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we really want to teach our four-year-old is to value the lives around her, to hold all people in esteem, and the importance of serving others. (Oh, and not talking back. But that&amp;#8217;s another lesson entirely.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barbie&amp;#8217;s colouring book is more than just a colouring book, of course. It&amp;#8217;s a subtle piece of interactive marketing designed to build a relationship between the Barbie brand and my daughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s genius, really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#8217;s the essence of smart marketing: Creating assets of high perceived value that build trust and grow relationships with customers and prospects. Get it right and they will enthusiastically buy from you again and again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When these assets help our prospects and clients to take action in service of the things they value, mere marketing becomes meaningful marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a timely example is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://goo.gl/MTd02&quot; title=&quot;Macbook Pro&quot;&gt;MacBook&lt;/a&gt;. For people who love their Macs, each interaction is a reminder of the power of good design to inspire, enable and embolden. It makes you believe you can do great work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, the product IS the marketing, and it quickly leads to needing an iPhone or an iPad or some other shiny Apple accessory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, sorry Barbie, you&amp;#8217;re in the trash today. My kid has more &lt;a href=&quot;/branding/7048/steve-jobs-heres-to-the-crazy-ones&quot; title=&quot;Here&amp;#39;s to the crazy ones&quot;&gt;important marketing&lt;/a&gt; to play with.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The World is a Little Less Shiny Today &#8211; Steve Jobs 1955-2011</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am a proud Apple fangirl.  From my iPhone to my Airport my electronic and computing life is completely mac.  It is a love affair that started 7 years ago when my ex gave me the first generation iPod nano for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrismukkah&quot;&gt;Christmukka&lt;/a&gt;.  Shortly after that I moved into a career with Apple retail, and that&amp;#8217;s how I discovered &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_jobs&quot;&gt;Steve Jobs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I heard he had passed away last night I &lt;a href=&quot;http://theoatmeal.com/&quot;&gt;cried&lt;/a&gt;.  And I thought as I was snuffling through yet another of his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc&quot;&gt;keynotes&lt;/a&gt; at 1 in the morning, am I crazy to be reacting this way? He was a CEO of company I worked for, and someone I admired but I&amp;#8217;d never met him. His &lt;a href=&quot;http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7945084053124129040&quot;&gt;words&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/apple-events/wwdc-2011/&quot;&gt;innovations&lt;/a&gt; though had a huge impact on my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I worked for Apple I was a technophobe.  I used to date people who were computer savvy so that they would take care of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://image.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/273049/273049,1288490721,2/stock-photo-a-computer-has-been-infected-by-an-internet-virus-a-scary-bug-is-on-the-laptop-use-it-for-a-64094755.jpg&quot;&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt; for me.  I had a palm trio and I used it to text, but the calendar was too confusing and I took only the occasional grainy photo.  When I started working at Apple they spent over a month training me  and getting me up to speed.  It opened up a whole new world to me and made me unafraid of technology.  Let me repeat that because I think that is at the heart of what made Steve so innovative, Apple made me UNAFRAID of technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After years of owning PCs and going to computer stores where I was &lt;a href=&quot;http://dumpalink.com/videos/Nick-Burns-Your-Companys-Computer-Guy-193e.html&quot;&gt;talked down to&lt;/a&gt; and treated like an idiot here was a place I could learn and ask without fear.  And as an added bonus everything was pretty. This was relatable innovate technology available to most people and I got to sell it.  It was as with most jobs not without it&amp;#8217;s flaws but I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2011/08/the-steve-jobs-formula-and-why.php&quot;&gt;learned a lot&lt;/a&gt; working for Steve.  As did my co-workers and most of our customers in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/ca/retail/eatoncentre/&quot;&gt;store&lt;/a&gt;.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://photoblog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/10/06/8181787-apple-fans-around-the-world-pay-tribute-to-steve-jobs&quot;&gt;Apple fans&lt;/a&gt; who used to come in and just rave about their laptops and iPods; People who just wanted to talk about how much better Apple products had made their lives were a testament to how Steve Jobs was much more than just a CEO of a good technology company. You just don&amp;#8217;t see that anywhere else, have you ever seen a bunch of people in Best Buy talking about how awesome their Lenovo ThinkPads are?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a person, he was far from perfect, and he did make some mistakes with Apple but he didn&amp;#8217;t let those failures stop him. He was incredibly savvy, inspirational, brilliant, influential and we&amp;#8217;ll be feeling the impact of &lt;a href=&quot;http://xkcd.com/961/&quot;&gt;his loss&lt;/a&gt; for a very long time.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/ca/stevejobs/&quot;&gt;Good bye Steve&lt;/a&gt; and thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>No strategy for Canadian Political Parties and QR Codes</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/canadian-political-parties-and-qr-codes/"/>
   <updated>2011-10-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/canadian-political-parties-and-qr-codes</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6411&quot; title=&quot;lm_qrcode&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/lm_qrcode-250x250.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; /&gt;Mashable wrote an &lt;a title=&quot;QR Codes&quot; href=&quot;http://mashable.com/2011/09/22/qr-codes-election/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;interesting article&lt;/a&gt; a couple of weeks ago about how QR codes could be one of the key pieces of technology that defines the 2012 US Presidential Election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QR codes are those square bar code looking things that can be scanned by your mobile phone to give you access to content on your mobile browser.   They act as a kind of bridge between the print world and digital realm. You can do all kinds of things with them (as you are basically embedding a URL whenever you generate a QR code), but as one of our clients said the other day,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use QR codes because everyone else uses them, but we really don&amp;#8217;t know how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a common gap in the evolution of QR codes.  The technology seems to have both suddenly appeared and drifted into the background. You may have seen them on movie posters, flyers or on wine bottles, but most of the time your eye just skips over them not realizing that those little black and white boxes actually &lt;em&gt;DO&lt;/em&gt; something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now they are popping up in political campaigns. As George Alafoginis, a digital strategist for Washington D.C.-based New Media Strategies says,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we notice in the political space is that it’s three to five years behind your normal corporate brand area. One of the exciting things is that we have the opportunity to close the loop between online activities and real-world events. We’re seeing individuals rely on their phones, and QR codes present an optimal framework for that. There’s an opportunity for campaigns to reach out to mobile-savvy individuals and transmit a message that will lead to an activation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we near the Canadian Provincial Election, I decided to see how our political parties stacked up when it came to the QR code landscape. From the outset it&amp;#8217;s pretty dismal. We don&amp;#8217;t need to analyse the NDP or the PC parties as, well, they decided to stick with the tried and true of Facebook and Twitter and skip QR codes altogether. But that may have been a smart move as it&amp;#8217;s better to not include them in any campaign materials such as lawn signs if there is no strategy to support them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Liberal and Green Party on the other hand, have included them on their lawn signage, but it would appear as though they were smacked on as an afterthought with no real strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biking to work yesterday, I scanned the QR codes of Liberal Party Sarah Thomson and Green Party Tim Grant and they both simply took me to their respective websites. Not exactly user friendly, action oriented or message driven. I have an iPhone and I do like surfing the web, but not on a street corner for 20 minutes, browsing their website on my small screen. Realistically, you&amp;#8217;ve probably got me for 1 &amp;#8211; 2 minutes tops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for all the Parties, here are 3 starter ideas for using QR codes in the next election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; QR codes could serve as an on-the-street campaign that instantly recruits supporters to speeches, visibility events and canvassing. The key is to make sure the &lt;strong&gt;QR code allows for action&lt;/strong&gt; – such as connecting with a supporter or pledging to canvass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The candidate could solicit donations via a direct mobile QR transaction. The experience would also be social: the contributor instantly shares her donation across social networks and encourages friends to match her donation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; QR codes could be a chance to get creative: Provide access to exclusive content, such as funny or moving videos, tweets or pics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above all remember that when someone scans a QR code it is scanned using their mobile device, so make sure that whatever page the QR code points to, it is optimized for a small screen. And please, please, don&amp;#8217;t just send someone to your non-optimized website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember to get out and vote October 6th.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What a Canadian Brand Can Teach You About Customer Experience</title>

   <updated>2011-09-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/what-a-canadian-brand-can-teach-you-about-customer-experience</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/6934/what-a-canadian-brand-can-teach-you-about-customer-experience/attachment/screen-shot-2011-09-30-at-4-13-43-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-6946&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-6946&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-09-30 at 4.13.43 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-shot-2011-09-30-at-4.13.43-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;519&quot; height=&quot;657&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/6934/what-a-canadian-brand-can-teach-you-about-customer-experience/attachment/screen-shot-2011-09-30-at-3-20-26-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-6935&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;This is the best customer experience idea I&amp;#8217;ve seen in a while.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maplelea.com/&quot;&gt;Maplelea Girls&lt;/a&gt;, a line of Canadian-themed dolls for girls is the (way better) Canadian version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.americangirl.com/index.php&quot;&gt;American Girl&lt;/a&gt;. Their latest doll is &lt;a href=&quot;http://dolldiaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/saila-maplelea.jpg&quot;&gt;Salia&lt;/a&gt; from Iqaluit the capital of Nunavat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the dolls, Maplelea has a customer experience program that is sheer brilliance. It&amp;#8217;s called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maplelea.com/spa.php?mSess=7abf317e928521c3e254e8cf2f6479df&quot;&gt;spa program&lt;/a&gt; and it goes like this. If misfortune befalls your Maplelea doll, you just send her to the spa:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Fill out a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maplelea.com/MapleleaSpapage.pdf&quot;&gt;spa admission form&lt;/a&gt; and undress her&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Ship her back to Maplelea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Pay a doll replacement fee (which includes shipping)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Get a brand new doll (that you paid for) sent to you dressed in a fluffy terry cloth robe and slippers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  I&amp;#8217;m guessing the reason that Maplelea adopted this clever service was to avoid parents having to tell their little girls (who dearly love their dolls) that their BFF needs to take a one way trip to the dumpster. Saying the doll&amp;#8217;s simply getting a little bit of primping at the spa is so much easier. And it works for Maplelea who makes it easier for parents to purchase another doll.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  I vividly remember when my daughter left her Elmo doll at the community centre. I couldn&amp;#8217;t get a replacement fast enough. And of course I had to be very creative in explaining where Elmo had been for the past few days (he was at a casino in Aruba).
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  Think about how Maplelea&amp;#8217;s customer service approach could be applied to other areas where people are either loathe to part with an object or hate the idea of paying a replacement fee. This spa approach would soften the blow if you needed to replace:
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Your cracked iphone
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Your broken sun glasses
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Your bike
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Just imagine how adorable your iphone would look snuggled up in a tiny bath robe?
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  On one level I&amp;#8217;m of course jesting. But I&amp;#8217;m very serious about the thinking behind this program.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  When designing customer experience initiatives, ask yourself:
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      What do you know about your customers that could help them when they most need it?
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      What could you do to ease a problem your customers are having&amp;#8211;even if it has nothing to do with the quality of your product?
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      How can you make something painful (like getting a replacement) more fun, interesting and engaging to engender greater customer  loyalty?
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>The Two Most Overrated Virtues: Greatness and Happiness</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/the-two-most-overrated-virtues-greatness-and-happiness/"/>
   <updated>2011-09-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/the-two-most-overrated-virtues-greatness-and-happiness</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/6884/the-two-most-overrated-virtues-greatness-and-happiness/attachment/screen-shot-2011-09-29-at-3-50-29-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-6907&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-6907 alignleft&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-09-29 at 3.50.29 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-shot-2011-09-29-at-3.50.29-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;230&quot; height=&quot;171&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My brother always wanted an electric guitar. He beeegggged my parents for one. He never got one most likely because they thought it&amp;#8217;d be too annoying to listen to and because they couldn&amp;#8217;t really be bothered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today if a kid expressed an interest in guitar (and the parents had the means) that kid would have a shiny electric guitar and amp faster than you could say &amp;#8220;Getty Lee.&amp;#8221; Not only that, but that kid would be registered for guitar lessons, guitar camp and invited to join in family sing-a-longs where dad would learn all the words to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/baba-o&amp;#x27;riley-lyrics-the-who/75e7055d463e94e648256977002ee262&quot;&gt;Baba O&amp;#8217;Riley.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern parents believe that having a talent is a good thing. It&amp;#8217;s not only personally fulfilling for kids but cultivates a kind of discipline that&amp;#8211;whether they become rock stars or not&amp;#8211;will serve them well throughout their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been a shift in thinking away from blind faith in natural talent to a belief that *practice, practice, practice * makes all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This notion was validated by Malcolm Gladwell who, in his book Outliers, found that it takes 10,000 hours of hard work to become an expert in a given field. But this is something parenting experts had been saying for years: that parents need to praise hard work over natural talent&amp;#8211;since talent can be transformed through effort:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-13128701&quot;&gt; one expert&lt;/a&gt; put it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligence-based praise orients the receiver towards the fixed mindset &amp;#8211; it suggests to them that intelligence is of primary importance rather than the effort through which intelligence can be transformed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let&amp;#8217;s pause for a moment and ask why we&amp;#8217;re so doggedly determined to make sure our children unlock their full potential? I believe because it&amp;#8217;s based on the basic assumption that people who have realized their full potential are happier. And we all want happier children. But is this basic assumption actually true?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowhere in Outliers does Malcolm Gladwell say that* any* of the people he profiles, from Bill Gates to Paul McCartney, are any happier than the far less accomplished computer geeks and musicians that populate the planet. Sure they have achieved fame and fortune, but so what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be surprised to know that it&amp;#8217;s happiness that breeds success, and not the other way around.&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/bul-1316803.pdf&quot;&gt; According to Sonja Lyubomirsky, Ph.D. at the University of California&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;Positive emotions produce the tendency to approach rather than to avoid and to prepare the individual to seek out and undertake new goals.&amp;#8221; Lybomirsky refers to these types as &amp;#8220;chronically happy&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although little is known at present about the genetic pre- dispositions characterizing chronically happy individuals, we can- not discount the possibility that long-term happiness may be directly linked—perhaps through inborn correlates—with particular desirable outcomes or characteristics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, just to recap what all this research tells us:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Talent isn&amp;#8217;t inborn, but is the product of hard work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Hard work is the result of a happy disposition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  A happy disposition is possibly inborn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Therefore, naturally happy people are predisposed to being talented&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  So folks, if you&amp;#8217;re got yourself a grumpy Greta or surly Steve, cancel those violin classes and save your money for therapy.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  Or, take my advice: mediocrity is an underrated virtue. Try to raise kids that are chronically mediocre and they&amp;#8217;ll get along just fine.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    People are resistant to change.  In an era of rapid paced consumption of information; constant instant contact and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.briansolis.com/2011/08/the-end-of-social-media-1-0/&quot;&gt;social media fatigue&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a class=&quot;zem_slink&quot; title=&quot;Facebook&quot; href=&quot;http://facebook.com&quot; rel=&quot;homepage&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; has once again made some major changes to its layout, functionality, and &lt;a class=&quot;zem_slink&quot; title=&quot;privacy settings&quot; href=&quot;http://www.allfacebook.com/2009/02/facebook-privacy/&quot; rel=&quot;homepage&quot;&gt;privacy settings&lt;/a&gt;.   Judging from the reaction on &lt;a class=&quot;zem_slink&quot; title=&quot;Twitter&quot; href=&quot;http://twitter.com&quot; rel=&quot;homepage&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; it&amp;#8217;s the Facebook apocalypse.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Mashable has conducted a survey and posted the results on &lt;a class=&quot;zem_slink&quot; title=&quot;Google&quot; href=&quot;http://google.com&quot; rel=&quot;homepage&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;+:

  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    The predictions range from the end of Facebook to the integration of it so totally that it&amp;#8217;ll become like credit. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbc.ca/metromorning/columnists/technology/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jesse Hirsh&lt;/a&gt;, the technology columnist on CBC&amp;#8217;s &lt;a class=&quot;zem_slink&quot; title=&quot;Metro Morning&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Morning&quot; rel=&quot;wikipedia&quot;&gt;Metro Morning&lt;/a&gt; suggests that those who eschew Facebook will eventually end up as untrustworthy social pariahs.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    I&amp;#8217;m waiting to see how it all shakes out.  I&amp;#8217;m a big fan of new things, and feature changes.  I think what&amp;#8217;s going on in social media can only grow the possibilities of meaningful and innovative ways to connect with the world around us and the people in it.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    What do you think; will you stay with Facebook?  WIll you turn off any or all of the new features?  Have you opened a Google+ account yet?  Will you even remember any of this a week or two from now as you&amp;#8217;re updating your timeline?
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &amp;nbsp;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>Where to find inspiration online</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/where-to-find-inspiration-online/"/>
   <updated>2011-09-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/where-to-find-inspiration-online</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; white-space: normal;&quot;&gt;Inspiration can be found anywhere. We’re always immersed in a designed environment and everything from a sign in the in the street, a magazine or a package of cookies becomes, both consciously and subconsciously, part of a visual archive in our brain. Same thing happens online, only there’s so much out there that sometimes it’s hard to find the good stuff. These are the top 5 websites I use to find creative inspiration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; white-space: normal;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ffffound.com/&quot;&gt;http://ffffound.com/&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-6827 aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;ffffound&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ffffound-580x477.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;477&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FFFFound! is a web service that allows users to post and share their favorite images found on the web. One of the things I like the most about their website’s functionality is that once you select an image, you start getting recommendations for similar postings which eventually lead you to that magical image that inspires you. It also allows you to track everything back to its original source which can result in getting to all sorts of interesting blogs and websites that otherwise would be difficult to find. FFFFound is very refreshing when you’re stuck and when you want to know about current design trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pinterest.com&quot;&gt;http://pinterest.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6829&quot; title=&quot;pinterest&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/pinterest-580x357.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;357&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pinterest is a virtual pin board where you can categorize images of things you like and share them with other people. Even though its purpose is similar to FFFFound, Pinterest has a completely different interface and layout, which feels like a happy, and cozy place online. You can take a look at my favourite things &lt;a href=&quot;http://pinterest.com/angelykke/pins/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/6823/where-to-find-inspiration-online/attachment/pentagram&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-6828&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pentagram.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.pentagram.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6828&quot; title=&quot;pentagram&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/pentagram-580x449.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;449&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pentagram is one of the most famous design firms in the world featuring super-star graphic designers like Paula Scher and Michael Bierut. They have designed hundreds of identities you could recognize like the one for MoMa or Saks Fifth Avenue. Their website is efficient and beautiful and acts like a huge bookshelf where you can pick and choose what project you want to see in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sagmeister.com&quot;&gt;http://www.sagmeister.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6830&quot; title=&quot;sagmeister&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sagmeister-580x353.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;353&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking about rock star designers, this website is by my personal hero and all-time favourite designer, Stefan Sagmeister. When I want to look at things differently and push creativity I often ask myself, what would Sagmeister do? This guy has designed album covers for the Rolling Stones, David Byrne and Lou Reed but you probably remember him for carving a poster for AIGA on his own torso (maybe that was a bit extreme). His website may not be the most functional but it conveys the concept of creative freedom and outside the box thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aiga.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.aiga.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6826&quot; title=&quot;aiga&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/aiga-580x351.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;351&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AIGA stands for the American Institute of Graphic Arts, and they offer everything a designer could ever need, from job postings, interesting articles and projects, events and competitions and great sources of inspiration. Their website is just so good I don’t even know where to start… visually gorgeous, with a grid system that makes it structurally interesting and categorized up to date information. Just take a look at it yourself, you’ll see I’m not exaggerating.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Kill the Happy Talk.</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/kill-the-happy-talk/"/>
   <updated>2011-09-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/kill-the-happy-talk</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/6794/kill-the-happy-talk/attachment/screen-shot-2011-09-21-at-11-53-18-am&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-6797&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-6797&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-09-21 at 11.53.18 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-shot-2011-09-21-at-11.53.18-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;291&quot; height=&quot;394&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night I was reading the first issue of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.momofuku.com/news-and-events/lucky-peach/&quot;&gt;Lucky Peach&lt;/a&gt;, a quarterly publication from Momofuku&amp;#8217;s chef and owner &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.momofuku.com/people/david-chang/&quot;&gt;David Chang&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across a thought-provoking exchange between Celebrity Chef &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.anthonybourdain.net/&quot;&gt;Anthony Bourdain&lt;/a&gt;, McSweeney&amp;#8217;s Publisher &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcsweeneys.net/pages/about-dave-eggers&quot;&gt;Dave Eggers &lt;/a&gt;and Chef &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wd-50.com/bios.html&quot;&gt;Wylie Dufresne&lt;/a&gt;. The subject was mediocrity in American restaurants. This exchange was about the proliferation of Italian food in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anthony:&lt;/strong&gt; (defending Italian cooking) &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s ingredient driven food&amp;#8230;.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wylie:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8220;Ingredient driven food. What the fuck does that mean?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anthony:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8220;Okay, it means taking three or four pretty good ingredients or very good ingredients or superb ingredients and doing as little as possible&amp;#8211;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wylie:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s called cooking&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230;.Get good ingredients and cook it. It&amp;#8217;s called cooking. Are you crazy?&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230;Who&amp;#8217;s like &amp;#8216;I&amp;#8217;ve got some shitty stuff, let&amp;#8217;s cook it?&amp;#8217; Everybody wants good ingredients. &lt;em&gt;Ingredient-driven&lt;/em&gt; doesn&amp;#8217;t mean anything. That&amp;#8217;s what good cooking &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love this exchange because Wylie&amp;#8217;s basic point is that cooking with good ingredients is the bar for entry when serving food in a restaurant. If the ingredients aren&amp;#8217;t good you can&amp;#8217;t call yourself a restaurant, so good ingredients aren&amp;#8217;t worth talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his web usability book &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758&quot;&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t Make Me Think,&lt;/a&gt; Steve Krug calls this &amp;#8220;happy talk&amp;#8221; and you usually find it in the About Us blurb on any given site or perhaps in your organization&amp;#8217;s mission statement. He aptly says &amp;#8221; if you listen very closely while you&amp;#8217;re reading it, you can actually hear a tiny voice in the back of your head saying &amp;#8220;Blah blah blah blah blah&amp;#8230;.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He goes on to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy talk is like small talk – content free, basically just a way to be sociable. But most Web users don’t have time for small talk; they want to get right to the beef. You can – and should – eliminate as much happy talk as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of Happy Talk consider what makes you great. And instead of saying how great you are, &lt;em&gt;demonstrate&lt;/em&gt; your greatness. It&amp;#8217;s the classic show me don&amp;#8217;t tell me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you talk about your organization&amp;#8217;s offering are you trying to sell what should be the basic bar for entry? One good way to test this is to replace your offering with the good ingredients one Wylie uses in chatting with Bourdain. Here, let&amp;#8217;s give the Wylie test a run-through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  If you run a theatre company, saying you make &amp;#8220;great art&amp;#8221; will not help distinguish you from other theatre companies. No one sets out to make &amp;#8220;bad art.&amp;#8221; Let&amp;#8217;s put it through the Wylie test: &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ve got some shitty play. Let&amp;#8217;s put it on the stage!&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  If you&amp;#8217;re a travel agency, saying you offer &amp;#8216;personalized service&amp;#8217; isn&amp;#8217;t really noteworthy, is it.&amp;#8221; Here, let&amp;#8217;s try it on: &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t really like dealing with people. Let me book your trip for you!&amp;#8221; Personalized service is what a travel agent can offer. If you can&amp;#8217;t offer that you&amp;#8217;re in the wrong business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Ok, one more&amp;#8230;.(I&amp;#8217;m having too much fun) If you sell your clothes on the basis of &amp;#8220;quality&amp;#8221; claims you&amp;#8217;re missing the mark &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ve got this shitty fabric. Let&amp;#8217;s make some clothes.&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember my blog post about that great &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/5668/brush-the-movie&quot;&gt;Scandinavian bath brush&lt;/a&gt; I bought? The video about that brush is set to music&amp;#8211;not a single word is spoken (good thing &amp;#8217;cause I don&amp;#8217;t speak Scandinavian).  The point is this: that video demonstrates what makes that damned bath brush so great. It&amp;#8217;s  a hand crafted piece. That&amp;#8217;s why I bought it, and that&amp;#8217;s why I love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    So please, go to the &amp;#8220;About Us&amp;#8221; section of your website and put yourself through the Wylie test. If you&amp;#8217;re claiming something obvious, kill it. If you&amp;#8217;re claiming something great, shut up and instead back it up with something (anything) other than platitudes.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Oh yeah, and while you&amp;#8217;re at it stay away from &amp;#8220;ingredient-driven&amp;#8221; restaurants.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>Find Your Medicine and Use It</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/find-your-medicine-and-use-it/"/>
   <updated>2011-09-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/find-your-medicine-and-use-it</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite Kathleen the crossing guard (&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/5855/the-dancing-crossing-guard&quot;&gt;who we recently blogged about)&lt;/a&gt; sent me an email with this music video in it. Like Kathleen, this song is about  authenticity, happiness and how to live a good life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It made my day so I&amp;#8217;m sharing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myspace.com/nahko/blog&quot;&gt;Nahko and Medicine for the People&lt;/a&gt; with you. Who couldn&amp;#8217;t love a song with the lyric &amp;#8220;There is no medicine on the television. So turn it off and turn yourself around.&amp;#8221; Or, &amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t waste your hate. Rather gather and create.&amp;#8221; Wise words indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, in case you haven&amp;#8217;t seen it yet, the little video we made about Kathleen (over 8000 views on Youtube) is also embedded here. Kathleen recently got a call from The Ellen Show (which &lt;a href=&quot;http://ellen.warnerbros.com/2011/06/dance_across_the_street_with_this_crossing_guard_0614.php&quot;&gt;featured the video &lt;/a&gt;when we first shared it). We&amp;#8217;ll keep you posted on whether Kathleen gets to meet Ellen. Hopefully she&amp;#8217;ll take me along with her since I&amp;#8217;m a pretty good dancer too.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Just launched: VoteONFood.ca</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/just-launched-voteon-food/"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/6753/just-launched-voteon-food/attachment/voteonfood&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-6759&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6759&quot; title=&quot;voteonfood&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/voteonfood-580x131.png&quot; alt=&quot;VoteON Food &amp; Farming&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;131&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been absent from this blog lately. My nose has been to the grindstone, helping &lt;a href=&quot;http://sustainontario.ca&quot; title=&quot;Sustain Ontario&quot;&gt;Sustain Ontario&lt;/a&gt; launch their new initiative, &lt;a href=&quot;http://voteon.ca&quot; title=&quot;Vote ON Food &amp;amp; Farming&quot;&gt;VoteON Food &amp;amp; Farming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a rallying call to Ontarians to make sure their candidates in the upcoming October 6th &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elections.on.ca/en-CA/&quot; title=&quot;Elections Ontario&quot;&gt;provincial election&lt;/a&gt; get the message: Food matters to voters and we must take food policy seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s also also a place for Sustain Ontario to share their &lt;a href=&quot;http://voteonfood.ca/why-in-ontario&quot; title=&quot;Good food ideas in Ontario&quot;&gt;Good Food Ideas&lt;/a&gt; and give you a platform to share &lt;a href=&quot;http://voteonfood.ca/why-food-farming/good-food-ideas&quot; title=&quot;share your good food ideas&quot;&gt;your own good food ideas.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And VoteOn makes it easy for you to &lt;a href=&quot;http://voteonfood.ca/take-action&quot; title=&quot;Write to your candidates&quot;&gt;write your candidates&lt;/a&gt; to tell them why food matters to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last year and a half, I&amp;#8217;ve found myself exposed to a lot of new (to me) ideas about food. Having clients like Sustain Ontario, &lt;a href=&quot;http://fiestafarms.ca&quot; title=&quot;Fiesta Farms&quot;&gt;Fiesta Farms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;zem_slink&quot; title=&quot;Local Food Plus&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Food_Plus&quot; rel=&quot;wikipedia&quot;&gt;Local Food Plus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://ontarioculinary.com&quot; title=&quot;OCTA&quot;&gt;OCTA&lt;/a&gt; doesn&amp;#8217;t hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor does working for &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/6679/barrys-face-makes-it-to-press-ready-artwork&quot; title=&quot;Barry on beer&quot;&gt;someone&lt;/a&gt; whose passion for food is only matched by his passion for helping people doing good things in the food space tell their stories well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;zemanta-pixie&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Mostly what I&amp;#8217;ve learned is the impact our food choices have on the world around us.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    As &lt;a title=&quot;VoteON: why food and farming?&quot; href=&quot;http://voteonfood.ca/why-food-farming&quot;&gt;VoteOn explains&lt;/a&gt;, food directly effects the economy, our health, the environment, our kids,  our experience of community and our farmers.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    That won&amp;#8217;t be news to many of our regular readers, but for many Ontarians, it&amp;#8217;s food for thought.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    If you&amp;#8217;re passionate about the food you eat and share, be sure to engage your candidates on these issues this election. &lt;a title=&quot;VoteONfood.ca&quot; href=&quot;http://voteonfood.ca&quot;&gt;VoteONfood.ca&lt;/a&gt; is a good place to start.&lt;img class=&quot;zemanta-pixie-img&quot; style=&quot;border: none; float: right;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=a7201da0-9326-489d-a077-1901dff91cf6&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s my attempt to pull together support for the White Ribbon Campaign&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://walkamiletoronto.org&quot; title=&quot;Walk a Mile in Her Shoes&quot;&gt;Walk a Mile in Her Shoes&lt;/a&gt; fundraiser, coming up on September 29th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://whiteribbon.ca&quot; title=&quot;The White Ribbon Campaign&quot;&gt;White Ribbon Campaign&lt;/a&gt; was started by, among others, the late Jack Layton to end gender-based violence against women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each year men literally walk a mile wearing women&amp;#8217;s shoes to help White Ribbon in their efforts to educate young men and boys on the issues of gender equality, respect and healthy relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Google+ or how I learned to stop worrying and love a new social network.</title>

   <id>http://getpoole.com/google-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-a-new-social-network</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure:  And now that I&amp;#8217;ve spent a lot more time with Google+ and I&amp;#8217;m digging a little deeper I do love it! Dang it Google, you got me again.  I think my iPhone looks a little nervous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like Google, I have four Gmail accounts.  I&amp;#8217;ve played around with Google docs, and Google reader.  I love love love Google analytics. I find their tools useful, easy to understand and I like how clean their interfaces are. Playing with Android on my friend&amp;#8217;s HTC phone gave me small pangs about iOS even though I am a rabid Apple fangirl. So where&amp;#8217;s the but for me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google+&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve had an account for over a month now.  It should be something I love.  From people I know and trust to social superstars the buzz is extremely positive.  I have been regaled about the amazing hangouts friends have had.  How great it is having different circles (no more inappropriate over shares with family or bosses). It was invite only and I&amp;#8217;m a sucker for an invite. There is easy access to the stars of tech and social.  I read at least two articles a day on how to get started, how to become a power user, all of the amazing chrome extensions  and why I need to be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I have some concerns that keep me from falling in love:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; They want you to sign up with your real name and assign yourself a gender.  This isn&amp;#8217;t a problem for me but it is for many people in my community.   Google&amp;#8217;s response to the complaint? Tough pants.  Which leads me to the conclusion Google takes itself a little too seriously and isn&amp;#8217;t listening to it&amp;#8217;s potential user base.  Not a good start.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Most of my favourite people aren&amp;#8217;t there (yet).  I have several friends who don&amp;#8217;t want to bother learning a whole new social network. I may be able to talk my Dad into it if he can do it on his iPad.  I&amp;#8217;ve had debates with friends around making the leap, does it mean giving up Facebook and/or Twitter? (No and no, for the foreseeable future.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; I keep being told how cool it is.  If you have to tell me this many times are you over selling it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what are your thoughts?  Are you using Google+ yet?  Have you fallen head over heels for the next great social network?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure:  And now that I&amp;#8217;ve spent a lot more time with Google+ and I&amp;#8217;m digging a little deeper I do love it! Dang it Google, you got me again.  I think my iPhone looks a little nervous.  Next post &amp;#8211; why I love Google+ and it&amp;#8217;s 5 simple features&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How did I get here?</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/how-did-i-get-here/"/>
   <updated>2011-09-14T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/how-did-i-get-here</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I had been waiting for quite a long time for this moment and finally here it is, I’m starting a new full-time job. It has been a long journey, literally! Here’s the story of how I got here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/6722/how-did-i-get-here/attachment/blogpost-graphic&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-6723&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-6723&quot; title=&quot;life&#39;s a journey!&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/blogpost-graphic-580x392.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;392&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time in Mexico, there was a graphic designer called Angelica who worked at a web design company in the city. For a while everything seemed to fit into place, she learned what she had to learn and after two years moved on looking for new challenges, but where to? She wanted to work somewhere where she could find further relevance in her practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her brother Alex, trying to give some existential/professional guidance recommended some books and authors, among them, Life Style by Bruce Mau and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.massivechange.com/&quot;&gt;Massive Change&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.institutewithoutboundaries.com/&quot;&gt;The Institute without Boundaries&lt;/a&gt;. “It&amp;#8217;s not about the world of design. It&amp;#8217;s about the design of the world.&amp;#8221;  That totally resonated with her so she did some research about the Institute without Boundaries and discovered it was a one-year post-graduate program in Toronto. The idea of eventually being part of the program stuck in the back of her mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time passed and Angelica became a freelance designer working from home and getting some contract work from time to time with architecture and design firms in Mexico City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She liked projects where she could communicate significant messages through beautiful mediums. She also enjoyed working in creative multidisciplinary teams and she was lucky enough to work with very talented architects, illustrators, musicians, filmmakers, photographers, programmers and even a poet. On the other hand she didn’t like tedious technical work because she felt that sometimes it devaluated her profession. She also didn’t like working in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point Angelica felt she had a fair bit of experience to take it to the next level and decided to apply the Institute without Boundaries. She got in and moved to Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year as an IwB student passed very fast and was very intense. She and her classmates worked hard to develop a proposal for a low-income housing neighbourhood in Toronto called Flemingdon Park. She got to overcome challenging situations that would seem totally scary for her before, like facilitating architecture charrettes, giving client presentations, speaking English every day… but most importantly she learned about using design methods to solve complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon the school year was over a new generation of students was ready to get into IwB. This time the assignment was in Lota, a small town in Chile and there was an opportunity for Angelica to stick around at the IwB and work as a facilitator, translator and graphic communicator. So she stayed another year with a part time job at the Institute without Boundaries supporting the new students. She even had the opportunity to travel to Lota as supporting faculty. That was one cool experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angelica knew that she couldn’t stay at the IwB forever and started looking for a full time job in order to keep growing and keep gaining experiences in Canada. She went to many interviews and sent many résumés and cover letters. There were moments when Angelica was losing hope in finding the right job. She even considered going back to Mexico, she was homesick, she was cold and she had probably a bit of a vitamin D deficiency. She just wanted to find the right fit in a place that was creative but also cared about strategy, somewhere where she could contribute but also be enriched, she knew there had to be a place out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then suddenly, it happened. The stars aligned. Coincidently, on the same week, two totally unrelated people referred Angelica to a small company called Hypenotic. They told her that their art director was about to leave and they were looking for someone. She decided to introduce herself and send an email to Barry who invited her to the office to have coffee and discuss mutual interests and goals. It turned out to be the right fit, right place and right time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The End.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you liked this story, (I happen to love happy endings). However I think this is just the beginning of a new story that is starting here at Hypenotic. I’ll do my best to share the most interesting chapters along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The 35 year old intern</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/the-35-year-old-intern/"/>
   <updated>2011-09-08T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/the-35-year-old-intern</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Nobody likes writing about themselves.  I took an informal poll this afternoon when I ran into a friend on the streetcar (that way I wouldn&amp;#8217;t have to do the math on the margin of error.)   It can easily come across as dry or as a #humblebrag  (or just bragging) and for those of us who are big into the self-deprecating it feels a little naked. (Both my Twitter feed and Facebook accounts are anonymous.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had more than one career; I&amp;#8217;ve actually had several since I started working at 12 (I was a babysitter, and certified too).  I&amp;#8217;ve worked in film, personal shopping, and retail and now I&amp;#8217;m making another jump into marketing.  I&amp;#8217;m not one of those people who has known their whole life what they were destined to do.  Except I have always had a passion for strange products and well done marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time I was in an American supermarket I was compelled to take home a bottle of Mr. Sprinkles.  Wouldn&amp;#8217;t you have loved to be in on that meeting?  I&amp;#8217;m sure it happened sometime in the 60&amp;#8242;s or 70&amp;#8242;s ; it has to be some of my favorite packaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-6705&quot; title=&quot;Mr. Sprinkles!&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/2686662609_78b0fdde381.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also come from good union stock.  I was on my first picket line at 9 months; my Dad still has my picket card.  I&amp;#8217;ve never been to Canada&amp;#8217;s Wonderland because they kicked IATSE out in the 80&amp;#8242;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a huge shoe collection (shopping problem) but I vote NDP and try not to support businesses that don&amp;#8217;t share my values.  And when a friend (thanks Andreas!) recommended me to Hypenotic I thought it would be an excellent place to gain some solid marketing chops. And that is how I became the 35 year old intern, now let’s just hope no one tries the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Now I&#8217;m Really Not Far From the Tree</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/now-im-really-not-far-from-the-tree/"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.notfarfromthetree.org/&quot;&gt;Not Far From the Tree&lt;/a&gt; sits right at the critical intersection of healthy food, climate change and social justice. &lt;em&gt;That&amp;#8217;s&lt;/em&gt; what makes them so unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/6689/now-im-really-not-far-from-the-tree/attachment/screen-shot-2011-09-07-at-4-28-36-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-6690&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-6690&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-09-07 at 4.28.36 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-shot-2011-09-07-at-4.28.36-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;570&quot; height=&quot;497&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The organization has a mission to harvest fruit trees from across Toronto. When volunteers pick fruit or tap trees for syrup they connect with their urban environment and their food in a whole new way. With 1/3 of the pick going to food banks and other hunger organizations volunteers also participate in helping  feed Toronto&amp;#8217;s hungry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wonder why I&amp;#8217;m gushing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m particularly proud to let you know that I&amp;#8217;m now a member on Not Far From the Tree&amp;#8217;s new steering committee. What that means is not entirely clear yet. But, I&amp;#8217;m delighted to be involved with this organization as it continues to do evolve and spread across Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NFFTT has accomplished an incredible amount in three short years. Here are some figures to give you a sense (of which there are many more in their &lt;a href=&quot;http://issuu.com/notfarfromthetree/docs/not_far_from_the_tree__yearbook__08-_10_&quot;&gt;newly released yearbook&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  30,0000 lbs of fruit picked by volunteers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  700 volunteer fruit pickers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Donated fruit and syrup to 25 foodbanks, shelters and soup kitchens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Founder and Director Laura Reinsborough knows that NFFTT is just scratching the surface. There are estimated to be 1.5 million lbs of food tucked away in homes and properties across Toronto. That&amp;#8217;s a whole lot of potential&amp;#8211;and alot of work&amp;#8211;for one small but mighty  organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough chitter chatter. Let&amp;#8217;s get to work!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Barry&#8217;s Face Makes it to Press Ready Artwork!</title>

   <updated>2011-09-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/barrys-face-makes-it-to-press-ready-artwork</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Check out what was embedded in my email from Beau&amp;#8217;s Jordan Bamforth. It&amp;#8217;s a real life mock-up ( think that&amp;#8217;s an oxymoron) of our Hypenotic mascot in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/5121/choose-the-new-face-of-beaus-beer-caps&quot;&gt;pose selected by you&lt;/a&gt;, our faithful readers way back in May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/6679/barrys-face-makes-it-to-press-ready-artwork/attachment/screen-shot-2011-09-02-at-2-45-14-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-6680&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-09-02 at 2.45.14 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-shot-2011-09-02-at-2.45.14-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;572&quot; height=&quot;537&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that Beaus has put a significant enough dent in their palatte of caps to get the press ready artwork ready to produce the next batch. Here&amp;#8217;s a preview of the magic behind the cap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/6679/barrys-face-makes-it-to-press-ready-artwork/attachment/screen-shot-2011-09-02-at-3-26-57-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-6684&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-6684&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-09-02 at 3.26.57 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-shot-2011-09-02-at-3.26.57-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;538&quot; height=&quot;279&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;re still about 6-8 weeks away from being able to purchase one of the 100,000 Barry Brew Beaus Beers at your local LCBO.  But if you&amp;#8217;re looking for your fix of Beaus before that, I suggest you head to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beaus.ca/oktoberfest&quot;&gt;Beaus&amp;#8217; Oktoberfest&lt;/a&gt; from September 30th to October 2nd. Obviously ones for creative thinking, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beaus.ca/oktoberfest/events&quot;&gt;Beau&amp;#8217;s events &lt;/a&gt;will include&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Keg toss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Spouse carrying race (we&amp;#8217;re in training for that one)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  100 pounds of playdough and Doo-Doo the clown for the kiddies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  We&amp;#8217;ll keep you posted on the beer caps and some fun opportunities to get involved once they&amp;#8217;re on store shelves.
&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>Hypenotic Helps Stop the Mega Quarry&#8211;You Can Too!</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/were-helping-stop-the-quarry/"/>
   <updated>2011-08-31T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/were-helping-stop-the-quarry</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/quarry_big.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-6660&quot; title=&quot;Quarry&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Quarry1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FABULOUS UPDATE: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Natural Resources Minister&lt;a href=&quot;http://hashonomy.com/link/statement-from-minister-of-the-environment-john-wilkinson-regarding-highland-companies-proposed-quarry-in-dufferin-county-132516/&quot;&gt; John Wilkinson announced that a full Environmental Assessment &lt;/a&gt;will be required in order for the Quarry to proceed in Melancthon County. Normally a full assessment of this kind would not be required. This is a major first victory for the many organizations who have been working tirelessly to make this happen. Congrats.&lt;br&gt;
Momentum is building among those actively opposing the proposed Mega Quarry in Melancthon County. We&amp;#8217;re spotting Stop the Quarry signs on more and more lawns across Ontario, and events and rallies are scheduled right up to the October 6 provincial election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop the Quarry has launched a billboard campaign to encourage people to ensure their MPPs and candidates are taking a stand on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re helping ensure that Stop the Quarry&amp;#8217;s word is spreading far and wide by creating a &lt;a href=&quot;http://nomegaquarry.ca/vote-no-mega-quarry/&quot;&gt;Stop the Quarry&lt;/a&gt; website (www.nomegaquarry.ca) to support their campaign. It&amp;#8217;s brand new so not everything&amp;#8217;s there yet. But visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://nomegaquarry.ca/&quot;&gt;the site&lt;/a&gt;, their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/no.mega.quarry&quot;&gt;facebook page&lt;/a&gt; and follow them on Twitter @nomegaquarry to keep on top of the issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re looking for a fun way to protest, check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://canadianchefscongress.com/2011/07/07/foodstock-in-melancthon-township-october-16-2011/&quot;&gt;Foodstock &lt;/a&gt;hosted by Michael Stadtlander on October 16th. Hope to see you there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>3 Ways To Avoid &#8220;Doing The Hustle&#8221;</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/3-ways-to-avoid-doing-the-hustle/"/>
   <updated>2011-08-31T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/3-ways-to-avoid-doing-the-hustle</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/fun-stuff/6630/3-ways-to-avoid-doing-the-hustle/attachment/screen-shot-2011-08-30-at-10-53-21-am-3&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-6634&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-6634&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-08-30 at 10.53.21 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Screen-shot-2011-08-30-at-10.53.21-AM2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;464&quot; height=&quot;183&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;On our first day back from a glorious three week vacation,  I turned to Barry (my husband and co-worker) and told him we had to &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;hustle&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; and  get refocused on work. A firm believer in slow principles and a generally annoying optimist he rolled his eyes.  Together we started contemplating the connection between the two meanings of hustle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hustle:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  To seriously move your ass to be as productive as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  To act in an exploitive manner to get what you want–at all costs. To steal from others to benefit yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second, less ethical definition was actually the first to exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As early as 1680 the Dutch used the word &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;hutselen&amp;#8221;  &lt;/em&gt;to mean &amp;#8220;to shake to and fro&amp;#8221; derived from a game translated into hustle cap where coins were aggressively shaken in a cap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something about the pushing and jostling sense of the word became associated with shoving anyone and anything out of the way to get ahead by any means possible. A Machiavellian approach to getting ahead where the &amp;#8220;ends justify the means.&amp;#8221; Centuries later this version of the term has been glorified in hip hop culture with the hustler as a kind of urban hero. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.50cent.com/#!all&quot;&gt;Think 50 Cent.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hustle&amp;#8217;s association with productivity didn&amp;#8217;t emerge until the late 1800&amp;#8242;s when Abraham Lincoln was credited with saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things may come to those who wait. But only the things left by those who hustle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Thomas Edison is credited with saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything comes to him who hustles while he waits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out that waiting and hustling are mortal enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But consider this; hustling in Lincoln and Edison&amp;#8217;s sense of the word is a kind of an exploitive thief as well. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/miic-mmac/chap_4-eng.php&quot;&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that 12% of Canadians will experience anxiety. It&amp;#8217;s no wonder really. Consider how hard we push ourselves to use up every moment of our time to be bigger, better, more. At the end of a long day we end up literally feeling like we&amp;#8217;ve been &amp;#8220;shaken to and fro.&amp;#8221; Those two definitions aren&amp;#8217;t so far apart after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carrie Fisher makes reference to this reality when she said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instant gratification takes too long&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So post-vacation and during the back to school season I want to share some great resources to help focus your attention on how to be productive without letting the hustle steal your life. It&amp;#8217;s something I&amp;#8217;m working on right alongside you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://zenhabits.net/start/&quot;&gt;Zen Habits&lt;/a&gt;: Leo Baubata is a web luminary on the subject of living simpler while being more productive. He&amp;#8217;s done it himself to great success. His blog post &lt;a href=&quot;http://zenhabits.net/no-hurry/&quot;&gt;How Not to Hurry&lt;/a&gt; based on the Taoist premise &amp;#8220;if nature can get everything done without rushing, so can you.&amp;#8221; Baubata admits its not easy, but the key is taking responsibility for your life.  Again, it&amp;#8217;s not about achieving less. It&amp;#8217;s about achieving what you want with less pain and strife.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theprofessionalhobo.com/about/&quot;&gt;Professional Hobo:&lt;/a&gt; If you wish to live vicariously through someone who made the choice to step off the grid, this is the blogger for you. Nora Dunn was a financial planning expert in Toronto until 2007 when she sold off everything she had and hit the road. Why? As she says &amp;#8221; &amp;#8216;Life Happens When You&amp;#8217;re Busy Making Plans.&amp;#8217; I realized this was happening to me and I didn&amp;#8217;t like it so much&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Watch &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ted.com/talks/carl_honore_praises_slowness.html&quot;&gt;Carl Honoré&amp;#8217;s TED Talk on Slowness&lt;/a&gt; focused on our need for speed (living the fast life instead of the good life) and what&amp;#8217;s to be gained by slowing down in terms of health, work, relationships, etc. He&amp;#8217;s committed to The Slow Movement and stop living on a stop watch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Hitting a wall</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/hitting-a-wall/"/>
   <updated>2011-08-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/hitting-a-wall</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Every now and then you&amp;#8217;ll be sitting there working away when suddenly, out of nowhere, BAM. A wall. Ouch.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Creativity doesn&amp;#8217;t always come easily. Sometimes you get to a certain point and you&amp;#8217;re absolutely stumped. No matter what you do, the solution to the problem just keeps evading you. Or, you’ll start off thinking you’re heading in the right direction, only to find that the idea looked a lot better in your head.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    And so you hit that wall. All creative processes come to a halt, and you end up sitting there staring blankly at your computer screen, being completely unproductive. Your mind starts drifting to that game on your iPhone you wish you were playing right this second&amp;#8230;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Of course, this doesn’t just apply to design, but to all kinds of problems and projects in work or life where you just can’t seem to focus and come up with a solution. So what can be done? Here’s some of what I feel are the best ways to bust through that wall.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;1. Start with the small stuff.&lt;/strong&gt; Hitting a wall has a way of making you feel pretty defeated, but instead of stressing about not accomplishing anything, start conquering some of the smaller tasks on your to-do list. The satisfaction of a few little victories can help put you back in the mood to tackle those larger issues.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;2. Go for a walk.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re just sitting there staring at a blank screen you obviously aren’t getting anything done. So get out and stretch your muscles. It may be just what you need to clear you head and who knows, you may find some kind of inspiration out in the world away from your desk. Sometimes you just need a little time alone to think and relax your mind.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;div id=&quot;attachment_6595&quot; style=&quot;width: 590px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/6594/hitting-a-wall/attachment/wall&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-6595&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-6595&quot; title=&quot;wall&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/wall-580x580.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;wall&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;580&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
      Out for a little walk break in the neighbourhood.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;3. If a walk isn&amp;#8217;t enough, try working in a different environment.&lt;/strong&gt; If you can’t focus at your desk, maybe you just need a change of scenery. Grab your laptop and head to a nearby cafe.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;4. Tidy!&lt;/strong&gt; I’m sure not everyone enjoys cleaning as much as I do, but I find it really makes a difference. If you can’t focus, clean up any clutter on and around your desk. Clearing your workspace can help clear your mind.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;5. Listen to music.&lt;/strong&gt; It’ll help drown out distractions and ease tension. If you’re already listening to music, switch it up. Find something with a different pace. Personally, I find I’m most productive when I listen to country music. If I&amp;#8217;m tired, I switch to dance tunes.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;6. Forget about it!&lt;/strong&gt; Well, not really. But try doing something else and just let the problem sit in the back of your mind, marinating for a while. You can’t always force things to happen. That “ah-ha!” moment might just sneak up out of nowhere.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;7. Reward yourself.&lt;/strong&gt; Tell yourself that if you accomplish something (e.g. work on a project non-stop for two hours, come up with five design concepts, write a certain number of paragraphs, etc) that you’ll treat yourself to a delicious snack, or 15 minutes of Angry Birds playing time, or whatever kind of reward you need to motivate you.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;8. Don’t be a perfectionist.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t be afraid to work on something because you think it&amp;#8217;s not good enough. Expect that not everything you do is going to be perfect right off the bat, but at least it’s a start. It’s better to have a rough start than no start at all, and rough start can end up leading you somewhere great.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    What are some of your ideas for busting through the creative wall?
  &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Social Marketing: How to prepare now for what&#8217;s next.</title>

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It never fails. I spoke at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cheesesociety.org/conference/overview/&quot; title=&quot;American Cheese Society Conference &quot;&gt;American Cheese Society conference&lt;/a&gt; in Montreal a couple of weeks ago on a strategic approach to marketing in this very social era and an intrepid attendee asked me to forecast the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beware experts who tell you they can. Find professionals who are versed in what&amp;#8217;s going on NOW. Listen to professionals who tell you we&amp;#8217;re at the dawn of the biggest shift in the way people are influenced by media since the advent of the printing press.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big shifts like this are invariably a double edged sword.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Folks profiting by the existing system will have to dig in and evolve what they do, and most people resist change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  On the other hand, as with the printing press, the internet and social networks, platforms, tools and new devices we connect on are putting the power of publishing and connecting around personal interests in the hands of many more people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only responsible answer is to help both groups understand the opportunity: Measurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you represent a large organization with consistent, sustained and integrated marketing spend or are a personal brand feeling pressured to get involved, the promise of marketing today is that you can get feedback on your efforts. Fast. Information you can turn into insight and act on. And get feedback in a hurry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I publish this post, and again when it goes out as part of our newsletter, I&amp;#8217;m going to watch for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Who reads it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Who shares it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  On what social networks?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  What are their comments?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  If they comment on our site, what&amp;#8217;s the nature of the comments?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  What opportunities do I have to thank, reward and or/connect with people who interact with it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re not creating content that&amp;#8217;s useful to people now, you&amp;#8217;d better be working towards it. Because while no one can guarantee what&amp;#8217;s next, I&amp;#8217;m pretty certain it&amp;#8217;s only going to get easier for people to create and find content they find useful. My professional advice is to start working on a recipe for relevance today if you&amp;#8217;d like to a part of whatever comes next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything else you monitor for? Let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Getting started with Location</title>

  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Screen-Shot-2014-01-30-at-3.57.42-PM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-14271&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2014-01-30 at 3.57.42 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Screen-Shot-2014-01-30-at-3.57.42-PM.png&quot; width=&quot;636&quot; height=&quot;387&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    A couple of weeks ago, a &lt;a title=&quot;Chef Chris McDonald on Twitter&quot; href=&quot;http://twitter.com/#!/cavachef&quot;&gt;Chris McDonald&lt;/a&gt; of Cava (restaurant) fame restaurant asked me about a great social platform called &lt;a title=&quot;Foodspotting app&quot; href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/foodspotting/id350727118?mt=8&quot;&gt;Foodspotting&lt;/a&gt;. I saw the founder &lt;a title=&quot;Soraya Darabi on Twitter&quot; href=&quot;http://twitter.com/#!/sorayadarabi&quot;&gt;Soraya Darabi &lt;/a&gt;speak at &lt;a title=&quot;The 99% Conference 2011&quot; href=&quot;http://the99percent.com/articles/6979/99-Conference-2011-Speaker-Announcement&quot;&gt;the 99% Conference&lt;/a&gt; this year. And we&amp;#8217;re both Trustees of &lt;a title=&quot;Awesome Food chapter link&quot; href=&quot;http://www.awesomefood.net/&quot;&gt;Awesome: Food&lt;/a&gt;, the Food chapter of the &lt;a title=&quot;The Awesome Foundation&quot; href=&quot;http://awesomefoundation.org/&quot;&gt;Awesome Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. She&amp;#8217;s awesome, and I&amp;#8217;d like to support. But I&amp;#8217;m always concerned about business people creating more hamster wheels instead of choosing their platforms strategically.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    To this end, I recommend do a bit of groundwork first.  The first thing I&amp;#8217;d be doing is claiming, editing and monitoring my location profiles on platforms like:
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/&quot;&gt;Foursquare&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;a class=&quot;zem_slink&quot; title=&quot;Gowalla&quot; href=&quot;http://gowalla.com&quot; rel=&quot;homepage&quot;&gt;Gowalla&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/places/&quot;&gt;Google Places&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;a class=&quot;zem_slink&quot; title=&quot;Yelp&quot; href=&quot;http://yelp.com&quot; rel=&quot;homepage&quot;&gt;Yelp&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/places&quot;&gt;Facebook Places&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;http://ourfaves.com/&quot;&gt;Our Faves&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    It&amp;#8217;s pretty easy:
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Just google each one to find their site
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Find a link that says something along the lines of &amp;#8220;claim my venue/business&amp;#8221; and claim it (you may need to prove you own it by answering a text or email)
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Edit your business profile to the extent each will allow you
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Then monitor them (most will send you updates) for comments, good and bad
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Respond usefully to comments and use insights to inform with platforms to start using
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  It&amp;#8217;s worthwhile for 4 reasons:
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      You can build relationships with people who use these networks and platforms
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      These profiles and comments come up in search, so you can balance negative comments with fair, reasonable responses
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Turning vocal detractors into advocates is a powerful thing for others to see, and converts make the best fanatics for your cause
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      When people search for your name, they&amp;#8217;ll find you being useful, interesting and social, giving you an edge over businesses with no voice
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;zemanta-pixie&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;&quot;&gt;
  That a good start?&lt;img class=&quot;zemanta-pixie-img&quot; style=&quot;border: none; float: right;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=2b683635-7f7c-49b2-be52-b9dfbde17811&quot; /&gt;

   <title>My Infamous Last Words</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/my-infamous-last-words/"/>
   <updated>2011-08-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/my-infamous-last-words</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/photo-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6543&quot; title=&quot;Me at the Office&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/photo-2-580x432.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;432&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before packing up my things and waving bon voyage to Hypenotic, I was asked to write a post about &amp;#8216;What I Learned at Hypenotic.&amp;#8217; I couldn&amp;#8217;t help but smirk at the notion since I could fill pages with the knowledge I&amp;#8217;ve gained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However- ironically- one of these tid-bits of knowledge I&amp;#8217;ve gained is that blog posts should be short and sweet, so here goes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;#8217;s one thing I learnt during my welcome stay here, it&amp;#8217;s that it pays to invest in a good quality, ergonomic chair and wrist rest. I&amp;#8217;ve been spoiled here, and the thought of returning to my cold, hard, rickety wooden chair makes me shudder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kid! I kid! Kinda- this insight would fall under the category of menial but notable discoveries I&amp;#8217;ve made, along with; yoga on your lunch hour- with your boss- increases productivity and focus along with building good rapport, grinding the coffee beans too much leads to a murky mug, two for one falafels fall on Tuesdays and cardboard is a suitable solution to overpowering A/C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joking aside, I gained more than just a few pals, knowledge of where to get the tastiest coffee from, and feelings of accomplishment- both due to gaining my 420 hours necessary for graduation, as well as for all of the important projects and work that they’ve graciously trusted me with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in, real work.&lt;br&gt;
For clients.&lt;br&gt;
Start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a heck of a lot more than the coffee-runs I unknowingly expected when I heard the word “intern” back a few months ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My most significant discoveries are obviously more weighty, learning a ton about good business, design, organization, prioritizing and compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world unlike school- where your aesthetic direction is all up to you- finding that balance between what you&amp;#8217;d like to see visually and what the client would like, was- admittedly- a tough pickle to be caught in at first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compromise, compromise, compromise, I kept hearing in my head. Not too much that when you finish and see the product, you blurt &amp;#8220;who in the heck made this?&amp;#8221;, but practice your bendability and never think of your work as too precious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when you listen to suggestion- that isn’t your inside voice&amp;#8217;s-, you surprise yourself by producing better work- and other times, not so much!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s all about going with the flow, and knowing that- especially as a creative- rarely will you ever follow a straight, predictable path to reach that satisfying finish line. It makes it more fun, right?&amp;#8230; Or perhaps the right world is interesting- anything but dull and lackluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I leave this position to recede back into the dark hole that is school’s bubble of safeness- kidding, again- mostly…-, I’ll take with me the knowledge and understanding that the &amp;#8220;real-world&amp;#8221; isn&amp;#8217;t nearly as intimidating or scary as I thought. Bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know every business and every body works differently, eats differently, talks differently, etc., but being an intern here at Hypenotic has given me the confidence and desire to go kick some @ss, and I thank you all for that- that means you Barry, Jodi, Rick, Lionel, Rebecca and Sonja, Erin- and Sonya!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do I want to do when I graduate? Everything and anything that falls into my lap that I&amp;#8217;ll enjoy doing.&lt;br&gt;
My plan is to have no plans, and take every day in stride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with that, I&amp;#8217;ve got to go catch the bus for my long commute home for the last time- for now&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Hypenotic: A Cut Above the Rest</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been asked to reflect on my time spent at Hypenotic, and discuss what I&amp;#8217;ve learned here. So I&amp;#8217;m going to share a few little gems of knowledge I&amp;#8217;ve gained with you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

I&amp;#8217;ve collected all these great little gems of knowledge, and countless others which I&amp;#8217;ll carry along with me into my fourth and final year. Oh, and for the coffee- I&amp;#8217;ve loved all the coffee.  &lt;/span&gt;

   <title>Makin&#8217; Bacn: How I&#8217;m cutting the email fat</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_6462&quot; style=&quot;width: 335px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/fun-stuff/6408/makin-bacn-how-im-cutting-the-email-fat/attachment/i-heart-bacon&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-6462&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-6462 &quot; title=&quot;I love bacon&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/i-heart-bacon.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;I love bacon&quot; width=&quot;325&quot; height=&quot;359&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    Picture: bacn.com. A bacn lover&#39;s dream.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re very active online and spend a good deal of time on subject-matter blogs and forums, you may frequently find yourself signing up for &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/about-us/newsletters&quot; title=&quot;Hypenotic&amp;#39;s Weekly Roundup&quot;&gt;email newsletters&lt;/a&gt; and email blog updates that are of interest to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to following content that&amp;#8217;s relevant and useful to your business, signing up for other people&amp;#8217;s newsletters can be a stealthy way to observe how other people engage your followers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Call it marketing research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, no matter how interested you may be in the subject matter of your subscribed newsletters, you are bound to occasionally find yourself with far too much to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All those newsletters may feed your mind, but the constant barrage risks keeping you from the most important tasks at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a fit of overwhelm, your impulse may be to simply unsubscribe from your email lists and &amp;#8216;start fresh&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you&amp;#8217;ve spent time building up a list of valuable resources, this may not be practical or desirable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a method I have found to help me filter these emails out of my consciousness until I&amp;#8217;ve got some free time to focus on them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;1. Create a Bacn folder&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to spam, which is unsolicited email, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacn&quot;&gt;bacn is email you want&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s just not your highest priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;2. Filter it&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a filter that reroutes email directly to your bacn folder and out of your inbox. This reduces your inbox clutter, while ensuring you won&amp;#8217;t miss a precious issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;3. Schedule it&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find time in your hectic schedule just for reading your bacn. This could be a designated time in the afternoon or sometime outside of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like those water-stained back issues of People magazine that sit on the tank in your bathroom, bacn is a treat best savoured on your own time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;4. Share it&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;#8217;t unsubscribed, it must be worth your attention. Share your emails with colleagues and friends &amp;#8211; preferably on your blog or social networks (wouldn&amp;#8217;t be fair to clog someone else&amp;#8217;s inbox) &amp;#8211; and become a trusted curator of useful information in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;When overwhelm sets in&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sigh. Sometimes you just have to hit &amp;#8216;delete&amp;#8217;. Like the blowout party you missed last weekend, remind yourself that there will, indeed, always be more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Quick tip&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of our clients use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/a&quot; title=&quot;Google Apps for Business&quot;&gt;Google Apps for Business&lt;/a&gt; to host their email. GAfB/Gmail makes it easy to create filters for your bacn (check under the &amp;#8216;mail settings&amp;#8217; menu).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to create one filter for several newsletter, use this syntax:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FROM: (newsletter1 OR newsletter2 OR newsletter3 OR so on)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t forget to include the brackets and &amp;#8216;OR&amp;#8217; must be capitalized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you have all your bacn tucked away in one folder for relaxed noshing when you actually have the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now&amp;#8230;if I could only figure out how to put the rest of the Web in my bacn folder my life would be truly distraction free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a favourite hack for minimizing digital distractions? Please share in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Hello from Hypenotic&#8217;s newest old employee</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/hello-from-hypenotics-newest-old-employee/"/>
   <updated>2011-08-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/hello-from-hypenotics-newest-old-employee</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Hi! I’m Sonja, a designer here at Hypenotic. No, not the lovely Sonya B. who, as you may know, was art director here for many years. A different Sonja. With a &amp;#8216;j&amp;#8217;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    I’m writing this post to introduce myself. Funny thing is, I’m not &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; new. I started here last spring with a three week internship. Then, I became the intern that just wouldn’t leave. After my three weeks were up, I stuck around for the summer, and then part time throughout the school year. Finally, I graduated from uni and I thought, well they’ve gotten used to me hanging around, might as well grace them with my presence every day! So, starting three weeks ago, I officially work here full-time. I am Hypenotic’s newest (but not really) employee, here for all your identity/promotional material/wire-framing/package design/misc. needs. I&amp;#8217;ll take on pretty much any task you can throw my way.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    So what is there to know about me?
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;div id=&quot;attachment_6468&quot; style=&quot;width: 590px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/6455/hello-from-hypenotics-newest-old-employee/attachment/kirafield&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-6468&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-6468&quot; title=&quot;Home sweet home&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/kirafield-580x435.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Home sweet home&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;435&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
      Home sweet home.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    I hail from an acreage in rural Saskatchewan, near the little town of Turtleford, population 505 (and home of &lt;a href=&quot;http://townofturtleford.ca/community-information/points-of-interest/ernie-the-turtle.aspx&quot;&gt;Ernie, Canada’s largest turtle&lt;/a&gt;). With the exception of a few years in Latvia, Poland, and England, I spent most of my life out in the country. Somehow, moving to downtown Toronto wasn’t that much of a culture shock for me. There’s just a few minor differences. Instead of looking out my window to see fields and forests, I  see dumpsters and one lone tree. Instead of hearing coyotes howling at night, I hear sirens. Instead of being surrounded by nature, I’m surrounded by high-rises, busy streets, and SO MANY PEOPLE (But, there are lots of raccoons here! That counts as nature, right?). I don’t know every single person living in Toronto, and they don’t know me.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Despite the differences, Toronto has become my second home and I’ve grown to love it here.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;h4&gt;
    Other things about me
  &lt;/h4&gt;
  
  &lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;/h5&gt;
  
  &lt;h5&gt;
    Like
  &lt;/h5&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Cats. Traveling to new places. Vintage dresses. Costume parties. Nice paper.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;h5&gt;
    Dislike
  &lt;/h5&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Low-fat cream cheese. People who walk too slow. When people write “your” instead of “you’re”.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;h5&gt;
    Scared of
  &lt;/h5&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Blogging (I’m overcoming my fears today, yay!). Bed bugs. Zombies. Saying the wrong thing.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;h5&gt;
    Known for
  &lt;/h5&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Being a crazy cat lady (I usually think cats are cuter than babies). Being borderline narcoleptic (I can and do fall asleep anytime, anywhere).
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;h5&gt;
    Weird little facts
  &lt;/h5&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    I love to clean. It’s just so satisfying! Arranging food in the fridge is like a recreational activity.&lt;br /&gt; I like the smell of burnt matches. Also,  a toilet cleaner called Toilet Duck. I don’t know why.&lt;br /&gt; My guilty pleasure is watching &lt;em&gt;Jersey Shore&lt;/em&gt;. I’m ashamed, and I’m sorry.&lt;br /&gt; I wrote a love song when I was seven years old. I can still remember most of the lyrics. It’s hilarious. But you will never, ever hear me sing it.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Well, that’s me! Now here I am; fresh out of university, ready to experience life out in the real world, and very excited to be Hypenotic’s newest old employee.
  &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Good Foot Delivers More Than Packages</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/good-foot-delivers-more-than-packages/"/>
   <updated>2011-08-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/good-foot-delivers-more-than-packages</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/6390/good-foot-delivers-more-than-packages/attachment/screen-shot-2011-08-02-at-4-24-15-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-6397&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-6397 alignleft&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-08-02 at 4.24.15 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Screen-shot-2011-08-02-at-4.24.15-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;229&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take something you would do anyway, then add a healthy dose of connection to community, mix in good feelings and stir. It&amp;#8217;s a recipe for success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was my experience when hiring &lt;a href=&quot;http://goodfootdelivery.com/&quot;&gt;Good Foot&lt;/a&gt; delivery service to get a cheque to a supplier&amp;#8217;s office. Good Foot is a courier service that delivers packages by foot or TTC at rates you&amp;#8217;d expect to pay for courier services. The only difference is that all of their couriers have developmental disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, it&amp;#8217;s not easy to get a job when you have a developmental disability. One of Good Foot&amp;#8217;s founders, Kristen Gauthier, saw her brother Jon struggling to make ends meet. Good Foot was born out of their collective desire to find a way for Jon, and people like him, to get good, stable work. Today Jon is co-founder &amp;amp; head courier at Good Foot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I placed my first Good Foot order last week I had the chance to chat with John. He was kind and funny and super-helpful.  Then a guy showed up with our package after having navigated the TTC to our offices. It was a pleasure to do something as mundane as shipping a package and get a feel-great experience as a bonus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did this exchange feel so good? I think it has a lot to do with being part of a community. When we joined &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bcorporation.net/&quot;&gt;B Corp&lt;/a&gt; we, as a company, were outwardly displaying our commitment to create public benefit. But an inward shift happened as well. Same with using Good Foot as our courier of choice. Here&amp;#8217;s how I describe it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you connect with others who share your values (a community) you strengthen your values and make it more likely that you&amp;#8217;ll continue to act on them in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is, joining up with like minded organizations like Good Foot or B Corp has given us a lot more than we bargained for. We&amp;#8217;ll continue finding organizations that help us define the contours of our values and in turn strengthen them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what organizations can you recommend to us? We&amp;#8217;d like to find as many like minded partners as we can.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Want $1,000 for an Awesome food project?</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/want-1000-for-an-awesome-food-project/"/>
   <updated>2011-07-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/want-1000-for-an-awesome-food-project</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-Shot-2014-01-30-at-4.06.41-PM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-14273&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2014-01-30 at 4.06.41 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-Shot-2014-01-30-at-4.06.41-PM.png&quot; width=&quot;1089&quot; height=&quot;211&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between all of the work and volunteering we do around here, we interact with activists, policy wonks, actionists, grass-roots motivators, people who work at all levels of the food system, politicians and of course enterprise. All play important roles in creating a food system that sprouts good things. But change is difficult for many reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporations are responsible for short term growth. Political entities for getting reelected. I&amp;#8217;ve long felt the best opportunity for positive and innovative growth comes from public engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I became a trustee of an awesome initiative. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypn.tc/pJnVdi&quot; title=&quot;The Awesome Foundation&quot;&gt;Awesome Foundation&lt;/a&gt; is a network of chapters consisting of  &amp;#8216;trustees&amp;#8217; who put money into a monthly pot that becomes no-strings-attached $1,000 micro-grants for projects that should get a boost.  If you haven&amp;#8217;t heard about it, here are the details from the Awesome website:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Awesome Foundation originally started in Boston in 2009 and has since grown to be a worldwide network of people with nearly 20 chapters in cities across the world, including San Francisco, NYC, Ottawa, London, Berlin, Sydney, Zurich, among others. Projects funded have included &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/08/19/theyve_been_swayed_huge_hammock_rocks/&quot;&gt;a giant hammock in Boston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tramsessions.com/&quot;&gt;tram sessions in Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://awesomefoundation.org/blog/2010/12/14/the-december-dc-awesome-grant-is-fab-ulous/&quot;&gt;a fab lab in Washington DC&lt;/a&gt;. Most chapters are geographically focused. But food is topic focused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chapter I became a trustee of is called &lt;a href=&quot;http://awesomefood.net/&quot;&gt;Awesome Food&lt;/a&gt;,  and it&amp;#8217;s the first chapter of the worldwide Awesome Foundation to diverge from the regional guidelines and focus on an issue/interest area. Awesome: Food, and of course its parent the Awesome foundation is an awesome example of people working together to help things that matter happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, the trustees include an ultra dynamic list of food area folks, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

   <title>Cool Down &#038; Get Cold Cash From Hypenotic</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/cool-down-make-cold-cash-from-hypenotic/"/>
   <updated>2011-07-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/cool-down-make-cold-cash-from-hypenotic</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope you enjoyed our little video.We made it to celebrate our commitment to paying for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lowfoot.com/&quot;&gt;Lowfoot &lt;/a&gt;members&amp;#8217; energy reductions for the month of August. What does this mean? Read on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Hypenotic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypenotic began working with Lowfoot as a client. They&amp;#8217;re a values-based business with a smart approach to reducing energy consumption, and we helped create the strategic and design foundation for their brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the process of writing their strategic manifesto, a critical question emerged:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re doing everything in our power to feed our ever-growing consumption habit. What would happen if we decided to kick the energy habit instead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we were writing the question we knew we were headed down a rabbit&amp;#8217;s hole of inquiry that was well worth exploring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We quickly signed up for Lowfoot, and soon after decided we wanted to be among the first companies to pay for Lowfoot members&amp;#8217; reductions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;August seemed like the right month to pay for reductions since it&amp;#8217;s when most of us think about turning on the A/C and leaving it on for the entire month. In fact heating and cooling are responsible for 56% of home energy use. So shutting off the A/C can make a world of difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video should help you consider some more creative approaches to cooling down like making a DIY cold pack, eating hot peppers, drinking barley water and a unique breathing technique (details below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Lowfoot?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lowfoot&amp;#8217;s founders Phil and Steve built a company based on the belief that the only sustainable form of energy generation is the one we control&amp;#8211;reductions in energy use. So they pay you to kick the energy habit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;****Here&amp;#8217;s what happens when you sign up for Lowfoot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The information in your smart meter is turned into intelligence you can use to understand and control your own energy use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  When you reduce your energy consumption you get cheques in the mail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  You work together with a like minded community to reduce energy use and learn about how to continue using less–and earning more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;   Your own data is aggregated with data from thousands of households who together make substantial changes to their energy habits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  It&amp;#8217;s addictive. Gaming psychology gets you hooked on cutting down almost immediately. Like knowing how many calories you consume influences the way you think about food, being conscious of your consumption makes it uncomfortable to leave things plugged in and turned on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So go fill a sock with white rice or roll your tongue into a circle and breathe through it. But what you should do first is sign up for Lowfoot so we can pay you some of cold hard cash.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creative Cooling Techniques Featured in Video&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; DIY Cooling Pack: Be sure to use white rice. More Details &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.intent.com/janicetaylor/blog/heatwave-7-simple-strategies-beat-heat&quot;&gt;here. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Eating Hot Peppers: &lt;a href=&quot;http://johndlee.hubpages.com/hub/The-Health-Benefits-of-Spicy-Thai-Food&quot;&gt;How Capsaicin does the trick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Barley Water: Try this &lt;a href=&quot;http://angelawarburton.wordpress.com/2010/07/27/beat-the-heat-summer-food-cures/&quot;&gt;cooling summer elixir &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Breathing Technique called &lt;a href=&quot;http://dishmag.com/issue109/health/12258/om-breathe-repeat-beat-the-heat-a-meditation-upon-cooling-off/&quot;&gt;Shitali Pranyama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special Thanks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following people leant their creativity to this project. Many thanks. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexsings.ca/alexsings_home.html&quot;&gt;Alex Hickey&lt;/a&gt;, Kirk Comstock from &lt;a href=&quot;http://comstockrecordingstudios.ca/&quot;&gt;Comstock Recording Studios&lt;/a&gt;, and our most brilliant and talented summer interns &lt;a href=&quot;http://sabrina-smelko.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Sabrina Smelko&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href=&quot;http://erinmcphee.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;Erin McPhee. &lt;/a&gt;And of course, none of this would have been possible without Jodi Lastman.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/technology/6099/being-a-hybrid-web-designer-developer&quot;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt; about the joy of being a &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/technology/6099/being-a-hybrid-web-designer-developer&quot;&gt;hybrid web designer/developer&lt;/a&gt; left a crucial component out of the equation. Apps. Yes, the world is turning into small pieces of specialized software that do one thing and, hopefully, one thing very well. It could be a game, some sort of productivity app for your iphone, a lifestyle app for your android phone, or something entirely different for that tablet resting in your hand. Whatever it is, to be a web designer and/or developer, having participated in the creation of an app will get you to that next level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are numerous stats out there but whatever the number, apps are increasingly becoming your connection to the rest of the world.  Mashable says it best with this:&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Barry says &#8220;Social Media is Gouda&#8221;</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/barry-says-social-media-is-gouda/"/>
   <updated>2011-07-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-6312&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-07-21 at 10.14.38 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-21-at-10.14.38-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;514&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a couple of weeks, agronomists, food scientists, cheesemakers and cheesemongers will be joined by one &lt;em&gt;serious&lt;/em&gt; cheese loving social marketing guy. On August 3rd, Barry will be delivering a presentation on social media at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cheesesociety.org/conference/overview/&quot;&gt;American Cheese Society Conference&lt;/a&gt; in Montréal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the conference&amp;#8217;s 28th year, but it&amp;#8217;s the first time the event is being held outside the U.S. That&amp;#8217;s a nice nod to Montréal&amp;#8217;s cheese making chops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Montreal, cheese &amp;amp; social media&amp;#8211;the perfect match for Barry who was born on the island, and raised by a Hungarian father who immigrated to Montréal and calls &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roquefort&quot;&gt;Roquefort &lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;The cheese of the kings and the king of cheeses&amp;#8221; every time he serves up a cheese platter. Barry comes by his love of cheese naturally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/6311/barry-says-social-media-is-gouda/attachment/screen-shot-2011-07-21-at-11-23-59-am&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-6315&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-6315&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-07-21 at 11.23.59 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-21-at-11.23.59-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;471&quot; height=&quot;373&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;Barry tweeting while munching on artisan smoked gouda&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barry will be helping folks in the cheese biz learn how to use social more strategically. Barry&amp;#8217;s going help these passionate folks learn how to leverage what the do, know and care about to connect to equally passionate online audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some interesting facts that might lure you to attend the 2011 American Cheese Conference&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;2:&lt;/strong&gt; The number of official cheesemongers whose job it is handle the cheeses during the cheese show&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;44:&lt;/strong&gt; The number of speakers making presentations during the conference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;1,400&lt;/strong&gt;: The number of artisan, farmstead, and specialty cheeses being featured at the Festival of Cheeses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;99:&lt;/strong&gt; The number of categories of ACS recognizes for master of cheese making&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;16:&lt;/strong&gt; The number of scholarships awarded to cheesemakers, chefs and students to attend this year&amp;#8217;s conference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American Cheese Society put together a little video on selecting Montreal as the site for this year&amp;#8217;s cheese festival.  It includes a cute animated short about Montréal&amp;#8217;s cheese history. The rest is a bit cheesy,but what do you expect?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/6293/councillor-of-world-class-city-has-priorities-straight/attachment/doug-ford-idiot-3&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-6297&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-6297&quot; title=&quot;DOUG FORD IDIOT&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/DOUG-FORD-IDIOT1-580x528.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;528&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Yesterday twitter was abuzz after Toronto City Councillor Doug Ford lied, embarrassed himself and somehow, an entire mega-city in a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously considered the brains behind his brother Rob Ford&amp;#8217;s successful mayoral bid, Doug said Toronto had &amp;#8220;more libraries per capita than any other city in the world&amp;#8221;. Two seconds on Google suggests his data was pulled from his tussy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But things got worse when Doug said &amp;#8220;I’ve got more libraries in my area than I have Tim Horton’s.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great project to save our libraries shared these facts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post is worth reviewing–there are 32 comments as of this writing: http://ourpubliclibrary.to/2011/07/19/reality-check/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;In fact:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        When the Urban Affairs branch closes, Toronto will have 3.9 libraries per 100,000 people, which is what Vancouver has. Halifax has 4.3 libraries per 100,000 people, more than Toronto.  In the U.S., the entire state of Vermont, which has only one-quarter of the population of Toronto, has 30 libraries per 100,000 people, which is 7-1/2 times the library density of Toronto.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        In Etobicoke (Mr. Ford’s area), there are 13 library branches there, and 39 Tim Horton’s shops, not to mention all the other donut shops. In fact, on a per capita basis, the people in Etobicoke have &lt;em&gt;fewer&lt;/em&gt; libraries than Toronto as a whole. They have one for every 27,000 people whereas in Toronto as a whole it’s about one for every 25,000 people.
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Tim&amp;#8217;s will undoubtedly appreciate the market research, this is clearly a sign of the apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s most disconcerting to me is the disconnect between a Councillor&amp;#8217;s perception of a healthy city and my own. This isn&amp;#8217;t a detail. Libraries are community hubs that give back far more then they require in terms of resources.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Planking with Purpose</title>

   <id>http://getpoole.com/planking-with-purpose</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/DSC_0028-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6271&quot; title=&quot;Planking&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/DSC_0028-2-580x385.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;385&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planking 101&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I  recently heard about the growing internet craze known as “planking” where you stiffen your body into a plank position and have photos taken at strange locations. It&amp;#8217;s so big there have even been&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43036847/ns/world_news-asia_pacific/t/australia-man-plunges-planking-death/&quot;&gt; &amp;#8216;death by planking&amp;#8217;&lt;/a&gt; incidents, and it&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;sooooooo&lt;/em&gt; big, that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trendrabbit.com/2011/06/video-sexy-rosario-dawson-planking-jimmy-kimmels-desk/&quot;&gt;Rosario Dawson planked on Jimmy Kimmel&amp;#8217;s desk&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.peopleplanking.com&quot;&gt;www.peopleplanking.com&lt;/a&gt; is an online community for plankers which provides rules for proper planking and a forum for planking discussions. The community rates planking photos based on difficulty and outrageousness.  Location is also key; people are encouraged to add the GPS location of their plank, with countless photos showing &amp;#8220;planks&amp;#8221; on famous landmarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dumbfounded by this craze, I probed to uncover its meaning and purpose. After asking countless people who partake in this bizarre activity and searching for answers online, I discovered that it&amp;#8217;s simply one of those weird existential things; the only reason people do it, is to be a part of a community of like-minded people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This got me thinking about planking&amp;#8217;s potential as a force for good. Could planking be about more than a bunch of bored, narcissistic teens needing an outlet? I mean, dancing was just an amusement before FlashMobs showed up. Now dancing has a whole new purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forward-Thinking Plankers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;****Turns out, there are lots of people using the powers of planking for good&amp;#8211;and there are vital lessons we can take from it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://planksociety.com/2011/07/planksociety-com-supports-the-fight-against-breast-cancer/&quot;&gt;Plank Society&lt;/a&gt; uses planking as a means of raising awareness about breast cancer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  75-year-old &lt;a href=&quot;http://media.theage.com.au/news/national-news/old-girl-planking-for-a-cause-2373691.htm&quot;&gt;Nancy&lt;/a&gt; planks to draw attention to to recycling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGZn4Fl0ZL8&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded#at=59&quot;&gt;Casas por Cristo&lt;/a&gt; planks to raise interest in engaging people to volunteer for mission trips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The Taiwanese &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1390795/Planking-goes-political-Taiwanese-girls-thousands-fans-use-internet-craze-promote-promote-social-causes.html&quot;&gt;Pujie Girls&lt;/a&gt; plank to promote travel to tourist locations, bring attention to the plight of stray animals, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Other small groups are planking to raise money for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/photos/galleries/planking-fun-and-profit/&quot;&gt;medical research&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it&amp;#8217;s inherently meaningless, these groups have reinvented planking and harnessed its tremendous power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What These Socially Minded Plankers Can Teach Us&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  People enjoy being a part of something bigger than themselves. We are programmed to crave community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Their loyalty to these communities and causes stretch far and wide- there&amp;#8217;s no limit to the time, energy and money they&amp;#8217;ll spend to continue being a part of it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Where there are communities of like-minded people, there is hope for creating social change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this, consider how you can tap into something people are already doing. Empowering an already active and connected community is a great- and yes, inexpensive- shortcut to drawing attention and gaining new audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s no stopping these fad-happy-folks, so use them to your advantage- and ultimately to the advantage of the community as a whole- &amp;#8217;cause heck, you may even have fun doing it!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>5 Content Strategy Lessons from a Tomato</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/5-content-strategy-lessons-to-learn-from-tomatoland/"/>

   <id>http://getpoole.com/5-content-strategy-lessons-to-learn-from-tomatoland</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/6251/5-content-strategy-lessons-to-learn-from-tomatoland/attachment/screen-shot-2011-07-15-at-1-19-01-pm&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-6255&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-6255 aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-07-15 at 1.19.01 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-15-at-1.19.01-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;428&quot; height=&quot;298&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  Seriously, how did tomatoes get to be so awful? No taste. Mealy texture. But all the while red and round.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tomato problem is not unlike the problem with poor communications. And, the crux of the issue is often very much the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out this passage from Barry Estabrook&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://politicsoftheplate.com/?page_id=831&quot;&gt;Tomatoland&lt;/a&gt; with the revealing sub-title *How Modern Industrial Agriculture Destroyed Our Most Alluring Fruit. *In this passage, Estabrook is talking to Harry Klee, a tomato breeder who is trying to save the tomato from it&amp;#8217;s currently tasteless existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ask commercial seed companies why they are making tomato varieties that have lost all their flavor, the answer is very simple&amp;#8230;They have focused all their energies on their customers. Who are their customers? The commercial growers. What does a grower get paid for? Yield, size and appearance&amp;#8230;so you have a fundamental disconnect between what growers want and what consumers expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself; are you growing tomatoes for the wrong consumer? Are you producing something that looks like communications but isn&amp;#8217;t actually appealing to anyone who could really care about what you stand for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** Here&amp;#8217;s are five ways you can tell:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Your copy is so loaded with acronyms that only someone from your organization could understand what (the hell) you&amp;#8217;re talking about&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; There&amp;#8217;s only one page on your site that talks to the people who are your end consumers and  it&amp;#8217;s buried somewhere. Oh yeah, and it&amp;#8217;s not the least bit compelling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Your site&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;About Us&amp;#8221; page starts with your mission&amp;#8211;the same one written by a consultant gathering dust  on the wall of your reception area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The only people following you on social networks are your friends and family or industry types. You don&amp;#8217;t know who to follow, and heck, Twitter&amp;#8217;s dumb anyway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; You&amp;#8217;ve thought about blogging but can&amp;#8217;t think of what you&amp;#8217;d possibly say that could be of interest to anyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this sounds like you, take the approach that tomato breeder Harry Klee takes in Estabrook&amp;#8217;s book. Figure out the right &amp;#8220;flavor profile&amp;#8221; of your communications message. Here&amp;#8217;s what Klee has to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no one perfect tomato&amp;#8230;.We&amp;#8217;ve found that Hispanic people prefer harder; more tart tomatoes than northeasterners. Probably because Hispanics are going to chop up a tomato and put it in salsa, while someone in the Northeast might slice it and put it in a sandwich. Different uses, different tomatoes. But there are some common traits. I think we can find them and re-create a pretty good tomato.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the tomato metaphor laid bare:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Hispanics and northeasterners = different communities of interest who might come to your organization from their own personal areas of interest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Tomatoes for salsa vs. tomatoes for sandwiches are the different needs of these communities of interest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The &amp;#8220;Common traits&amp;#8221; = the core mission your organization is on that allows you to be useful and relevant to a range of people each with their own interests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get it? The good news is you too can build a better tomato&amp;#8211;or at least try. Strive to create one that&amp;#8217;s tasty and can be good in a salad, a salsa or in a sandwich. The question is what are the core &amp;#8216;genetic traits&amp;#8217; that make up who you are? What&amp;#8217;s the core flavour profile that will allow you to be adaptable and yet stand for something with integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now go make a sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I love to cook. It&amp;#8217;s not something that comes to me naturally, or that I have a real aptitude for, but it&amp;#8217;s for these reasons that I find cooking to be such a rich, challenging, and engaging sensory experience. There&amp;#8217;s nothing more rewarding than being able to eat the fruits of your labour- literally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite lacking natural ability in the kitchen,  I do have an innate understanding of one thing- visual communication. I&amp;#8217;m a designer and illustrator by trade, but more importantly I&amp;#8217;m a visual learner. If you were to present me with a list of ingredients and instructions, but with absolutely no visual aid, I&amp;#8217;d be less likely to understand, process, and therefore produce your delicious recipe. It&amp;#8217;s nothing personal- I&amp;#8217;m sure your Aunt&amp;#8217;s casserole is divine, this is just something hardwired into my biology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, give me information presented in conjunction with pictures, charts, diagrams, and some solid design and I&amp;#8217;ll be enthralled. Take the minimalist photography of culinary grad, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.frenchcuisse.com/&quot;&gt;William Matthew Valle&lt;/a&gt;, or the sequential photographs and clear instructions in Jane Horby&amp;#8217;s book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0714859583?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=borborygmi-20&quot;&gt;What to Cook and How to Cook it&lt;/a&gt;, *and IKEA&amp;#8217;s &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://demo.fb.se/e/ikea/homemade_is_best/&quot;&gt;Homemade is Best&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.  They&amp;#8217;re all good on the eyes, while still appealing to the stomach.&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;/em&gt;* &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I created this Guacamole recipe for all you other visceral creatures out there.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-6158&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/6115/visualizing-food/attachment/erinmcphee_guacamole_blogpost_final&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-6159&quot; title=&quot;ErinMcPhee_Guacamole_Blogpost_Final&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/ErinMcPhee_Guacamole_Blogpost_Final1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;612&quot; height=&quot;792&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    Mahone bay from an &quot;Adirondack&quot; (Muskoka) chair outside the Atlantica Resort
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course half the point of our Discovery session is to get up to speed on what&amp;#8217;s special about our clients in a hurry. But yesterday I ran a strategy development session for our friends at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tasteofnovascotia.com/&quot; title=&quot;Taste of Nova Scotia website&quot;&gt;Taste of Nova Scotia&lt;/a&gt; that offered learning in areas I hadn&amp;#8217;t expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taste of Nova Scotia is currently a 135 member marketing network of restaurants, food producers and processors across the province. They&amp;#8217;re great, hard-working people doing things that matter, and Hypenotic is here to help them define a needle for this powerful network to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expected to find great ingredients:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  A GORGEOUS province&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Famously nice people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  World class seafood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Dedicated team and board members&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found two ingredients that blew me away:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; *&lt;em&gt;Nova Scotia is more in touch with their heritage, traditions and culture than most places. *&lt;/em&gt;Their size and location have shielded them somewhat from hyper-commercialization. Unlike other provinces and states with major cities in them, Nova Scotia has reacted to a sudden influx of corporate wealth eschewing useful urban planning in favour of random corporate interests. Over growlers of &lt;a href=&quot;http://granitebreweryhalifax.ca/&quot; title=&quot;Granite Brewery&quot;&gt;Granite Brewery &lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;&lt;a href=&quot;http://granitebreweryhalifax.ca/beerdetails.php?id=12&quot; title=&quot;Granite Brewery Peculiar Beer&quot;&gt;Peculiar&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216; and then &amp;#8216;&lt;a href=&quot;http://granitebreweryhalifax.ca/beerdetails.php?id=16&quot; title=&quot;Granite Brewery Greenman&quot;&gt;Greenman Organic&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216; around a fire at the&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atlanticaoakisland.com/en/home/default.aspx&quot; title=&quot;Atlantica Oak Island Resort&quot;&gt; Atlantica Oak Island Resort&lt;/a&gt; last night, William Allaway of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.acadianmaple.com/&quot; title=&quot;Acadian Maple Products&quot;&gt;Acadian Maple Products &lt;/a&gt;told me that I&amp;#8217;d be hard pressed to find a Nova Scotian who couldn&amp;#8217;t find a cord of wood and survive on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Nova Scotia has an amazing team looking out for it&amp;#8217;s interests&lt;/strong&gt;. During the brainstorm session I was schooled in the origins and ongoing make-up of Taste of Nova Scotia&amp;#8217;s board. It was started by concerned government employees who wanted to get people buying fresh peas instead canned ones. The current incarnations is an ultra dynamic group of citizens, industry members AND GOVERNMENT partners. In my humble experience, the role of government tends to be about safety and preserving the status quo at best, and creating conditions that suit larger (short term) commercial interests at their worst. Innovation is not typically on the list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between what came out of the session and what I heard sitting through their AGM afterwards, the interests and make-up of this organization, combined with their largely unadulterated traditional awesomeness offers a bright future for this place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It left me wondering what other regions can do to recognize and preserve their charms? This place doesn&amp;#8217;t need economic development so much as pedestals and platforms to put their trophies on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what can other regions do team up with government for innovation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m going to think about it over a long vacation sitting by the ocean in Rose Bay and I&amp;#8217;ll let you know what I come up with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/6002/the-proposed-mega-quarry-its-about-time&quot;&gt;Last week I wrote about &lt;/a&gt;the &amp;#8220;Downstream Downtown&amp;#8221; event that we attended to learn more about the Mega Quarry slated for Melancthon, Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, our friends at &lt;a href=&quot;http://goodfoodrevolution.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Good Food Revolution&lt;/a&gt; posted a video highlighting many of the people who also attended the event speaking about why the proposed Mega Quarry, just 1.5 hours outside of Toronto, is an issue we *all *need to be concerned about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I&amp;#8217;m letting you that we&amp;#8217;re deeply committed to this issue and we&amp;#8217;ll continue lending our support in any way we can.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Being a Hybrid Web Designer / Developer</title>

  &lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-6106 &quot; title=&quot;designer-developer-13&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/designer-developer-13-580x412.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;412&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    Image above is from Mashable article dated September 8, 2010
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many small, passionate businesses, here at the Hypenotic headquarters everyone wears different hats depending on what is needed and who is available to do what. You might be an Illustrator who works primarily for print, but is asked to do a Photoshop mockup for a Facebook landing page. You could be an Art Director who needs to get a handle on the inner workings of WordPress. Or better yet, you could be the Developer asked to make coffee for everyone, while dancing on your head. Whatever it is, usually throughout the day you are tasked to do something outside of your primary job description.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  In terms of the web, understanding design fundamentals and future trends, being proficient at Photoshop, knowing PHP and MySQL, knowing your way around a server and a couple of CMS systems is critical to your success as a Hybrid Web Designer/Developer. Not only that, but it is extremely helpful in being able to see the big picture when it comes to brainstorming ideas, creative strategy, pushing projects ahead and perhaps most importantly, what is technically possible based on the clients design inspirations framed by the project budget and timeline.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, developers who can design and designers who can code are the jack of all trades. Knowing one informs the other. As Jolie O&amp;#8217;Dell from Mashable writes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good designers and developers rule the web — they’re the ones who build it, after all. And some of the most interesting and useful players in creating the modern Internet are hybrids between those two disciplines — people who can translate between the disparate languages of the visual and the technical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mashable.com/2010/09/08/hybrid-designer-developers/&quot;&gt;ton of resources&lt;/a&gt; for those of you who are designers who want to delve into code or a developers who want to visualize the future.  For myself, I love doing both and would encourage anyone who is interested in doing the same. Currently, I have my TextWrangler open on one screen, Photoshop on the other and fresh coffee on my desk. What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>5 Actually Useful CSS &#038; HTML tools</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/5-actually-useful-css-html-tools/"/>
   <updated>2011-07-08T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/5-actually-useful-css-html-tools</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-6147&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/technology/6142/5-actually-useful-css-html-tools/attachment/toolsstuff&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-6147&quot; title=&quot;toolsstuff&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/toolsstuff.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;275&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fillerati.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fillerati&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You have to admit that reading &amp;#8220;Lorem Ipsum&amp;#8221; over and over gets boring. Fillerati solves that problem by selecting random passages from literary classics like Carroll&amp;#8217;s  &lt;em&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;/em&gt;. This tool even takes it a step further by even generating HTML tags to go with it like lists, headings, and paragraphs.&lt;br&gt;
» &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fillerati.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.fillerati.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;a href=&quot;http://css3generator.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; CSS3 Generator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Want to generate css text-shadows in about 10 seconds? Howabout at the same time see which browsers the generated code is compatible with? It even offers you a nice preview area.&lt;br&gt;
» &lt;a href=&quot;http://css3generator.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://css3generator.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codebeautifier.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Code Beautifier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
CodeBeautifier optimizes and cleans up your css code. Once you&amp;#8217;ve written your stylesheet pop it into the beautifier and choose between several options like a balance between readability and size, hardcore smallest size possible, or according to custom settings that you pick.&lt;br&gt;
» &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codebeautifier.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.codebeautifier.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. &lt;a href=&quot;http://pxtoem.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PXtoEM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;#8220;[...] text set in EMs scale to the body font-size. Only one element’s font-size needs to change instead of individually changing the font-size of each element. [...] Accessibility is increased for end-users because text is scaled based on their preferences rather than set statically in pixels.&amp;#8221; Keeping track of EMs can be a difficult task since it can vary depending on the body font size you choose. Thankfully PXtoEM provides handy conversion tables and converters to keep you from getting a headache.&lt;br&gt;
» &lt;a href=&quot;http://pxtoem.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://pxtoem.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FontSquirrel&amp;#8217;s @Font-Face Generator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Who doesn&amp;#8217;t like fancy fonts on their website? Stick a compatible font file from your computer into the generator and FontSquirrel will automatically convert then spit out code + files for you to use. It&amp;#8217;s highly supported by a growing community and extremely up to date with changing standards.&lt;br&gt;

   <title>Marketer&#8217;s Toolkit: Five iPhone apps I can&#8217;t live without</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/five-iphone-apps-i-cant-live-without/"/>
   <updated>2011-07-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/five-iphone-apps-i-cant-live-without</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_6074&quot; style=&quot;width: 144px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-6074&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/fun-stuff/6065/five-iphone-apps-i-cant-live-without/attachment/reeder-app&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-6074  &quot; title=&quot;Reeder screenshot&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/reeder-app.png&quot; alt=&quot;Reeder RSS reader&quot; width=&quot;134&quot; height=&quot;202&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    Reeder
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the fast-paced world that is modern digital marketing, there are some things you always need to have close to hand. Like your iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, recently I mistakenly left my baby at home in the morning and I found myself struggling to focus all day. Remarkably, this thing I once lived without has become so important to the way I work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, here is a short list of some of my must-have apps. These are more than just gadgets. Most of these have worked themselves into my daily routine.&lt;a href=&quot;http://simplenoteapp.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://simplenoteapp.com/&quot;&gt;Simplenote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://simplenoteapp.com/&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://simplenoteapp.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://simplenoteapp.com/&quot; title=&quot;Simplenote&quot;&gt;Simplenote&lt;/a&gt; is an wonderful and simple app for taking quick notes on the fly. Your notes can be tagged and they are easy to search or scroll through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can send your notes via email or publish them directly to the web for sharing with your friends right from the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need a free Simplenote account, which gives you access to your notes online. They can also be synced with several free and paid software on both Mac and PCs (I use Notational Velocity on my MacBook) for universal access to your notes.&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/&quot;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/&quot; title=&quot;Dropbox&quot;&gt;Dropbox &lt;/a&gt;iPhone app is a complement to the free Dropbox software on your computer and in the cloud. You can easily drag documents into the Dropbox folder on your desktop for reading later on your iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always have an ebook or two on the go, which I read when I&amp;#8217;m taking a break from my computer, or while waiting for a meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://reederapp.com&quot;&gt;Reeder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every marketer needs a place to do their daily review of favourite blog posts to post, tweet, or use as inspiration for their own posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve used several RSS readers on the iPhone. I resisted &lt;a href=&quot;http://reederapp.com/&quot; title=&quot;Reeder&quot;&gt;Reeder&lt;/a&gt; because some of the free ones are pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one day after I&amp;#8217;d heard the name Reeder repeatedly over the last week, I just broke down and bought it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say, this RSS reader is absolutely gorgeous and really good for reading on the go. The sharing features are top notch, too.&lt;a href=&quot;%22http://www.mailchimp.com&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;%22http://www.mailchimp.com&quot;&gt;MailChimp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;%22http://www.mailchimp.com&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;%22http://www.mailchimp.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;ve ever pulled the trigger on a critical newsletter or campaign mailing and then had to run off to a meeting, you&amp;#8217;ve probably spent the whole meeting fretting about open rates, top links, and unsubscribes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the free &lt;a href=&quot;http://mailchimp.com&quot; title=&quot;MailChimp&quot;&gt;MailChimp&lt;/a&gt; app for iPhone, you have all that information at your fingertip. The app has all the groovy visual style of MailChimp online with slick charts that keep you on top of your critical stats.&lt;a href=&quot;http://ego-app.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ego-app.com/&quot;&gt;Ego&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ego-app.com/&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ego-app.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the MailChimp app, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ego-app.com/&quot; title=&quot;Ego&quot;&gt;Ego&lt;/a&gt; lets you keep track of key metrics on the go. In this case, Ego will keep you up to speed on your Google Analytics, Feedburner, tumblr and twitter stats, along with a few other apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can&amp;#8217;t walk by a mirror, without checking to see how many twitter followers you have, Ego is for you.&lt;a href=&quot;http://instagr.am/&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://instagr.am/&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://instagr.am/&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://instagr.am/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like a cross between the Hipstamatic and flickr, &lt;a href=&quot;http://instagr.am/&quot; title=&quot;Instagram&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; lets you take photos, apply cool filters and effects, then share them with your network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this surface, it&amp;#8217;s just plain fun. But Instagram can be an effective tool for quick content generation and that&amp;#8217;s why I&amp;#8217;m including it here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it&amp;#8217;s your turn. What are your favourite marketing tools on the iPhone?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Saving the Economy and your Health One Pedal at a Time</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/biking-blunders/"/>
   <updated>2011-07-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/biking-blunders</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-5971&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/5968/biking-blunders/attachment/biking-troubles&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5971&quot; title=&quot;Biking Blunders&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/biking-troubles-580x375.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an angst-y teen, I often went for bike rides that lasted hours. With no clear destination in mind, I was on the all important quest in search of  &amp;#8220;myself.&amp;#8221;  While now I laugh at how insignificant my problems really were, I can&amp;#8217;t help but think about how biking was a healing force in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/story/2011/06/23/jarvis-bike-lane.html&quot;&gt;read about plans to remove the Jarvis bike lane&lt;/a&gt;, I felt a significant loss for those who bike in Toronto; my mind immediately turned to the psychic benefits that would be lost along with the bike lane. Let&amp;#8217;s face it: Biking = therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#8217;s not just my experience. According to Rory McMullan, author of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chelseagreen.com/bookstore/item/biking_to_work:paperback&quot;&gt;Biking to Work&lt;/a&gt;, regular cyclists:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  add over 2 years to their life expectancy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  have the general fitness and health of someone 10 years younger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  are 50% less likely to experience depression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As experts now know, depression isn&amp;#8217;t an isolated issue. People who experience depression are more likely to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/tc/depression-anxiety-and-physical-health-problems-topic-overview&quot;&gt;other chronic health issues&lt;/a&gt; like diabetes, arthritis, heart disease, stroke&amp;#8230;the list goes on and on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if we just focused on the mental health benefits of biking, we could pretty easily make the case that bike lanes would result in reduced health costs, greater productivity resulting in a healthy economy and more taxable income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I know for certain is that during my long aimless bike rides when I talked out my problems (albeit, to myself- no shame here!) and cleared my head, I saved myself from juicy therapist bills and from visits to my doctor which could be directed toward more pressing health issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So can someone, for the love of god, buy Ford a bike?!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Hypenotic&#8217;s New Hire!</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/hypenotics-new-hire/"/>
   <updated>2011-06-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/hypenotics-new-hire</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sure you&amp;#8217;ve heard the theory that &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.jhccs.com/2009/10/22/how-can-mimicking-the-person-you-are-interviewing-with-help-get-you-the-job.aspx&quot;&gt;people hire people who are like themselves.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this can have all kinds of negative consequences&amp;#8211;glass ceiling, racism, &amp;#8220;Old Boys Club&amp;#8221; kind of issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in our case it&amp;#8217;s resulted in an incredibly serendipitous event. We hired someone who looks just like Barry&amp;#8211;except she&amp;#8217;s female, younger, harrier and comes from Mexico, not Montreal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out this picture of &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/about-us&quot;&gt;Barry &lt;/a&gt;and our new Senior art director &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.angelica-ramos.com/&quot;&gt;Angélica Ramos&lt;/a&gt; and tell me&amp;#8211;does she not look just like Barry (but of course in a female kind of way)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As my Yiddish grandmother would say, they&amp;#8217;re both &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.warrenadler.com/title-funnyboys-glossary.shtml&quot;&gt;Shayna Punim&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8211;such pretty faces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest ever quarry in Canada is proposed for a site only 100 km north of Toronto in Melancthon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night, I was invited to a gathering of individuals who are actively engaged in food issues to learn more about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://stopthemelancthonquarry.ca/&quot;&gt;proposed Mega Quarry&lt;/a&gt;. One of the most resonant speakers of the night was Brent Preston, owner of Creemore&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thenewfarm.ca/&quot;&gt;The New Farm.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brent&amp;#8217;s brief presentation made me wonder how we could harness our collective creativity and intelligence to think differently about *time. *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thousands of acres of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.canadians.org/activistblog/?tag=honeywood&quot;&gt;Honeywood silt loam&lt;/a&gt;, the best grade soil in the province, would be dug up to create the mega quarry. Brent asked the folks in the room to think about that soil. To &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; think about what it took to create the soil that appeared after the ice from the last ice age melted away. He asked us to consider how long it took for nature to create this soil that farmers have farmed on for generations. He asked us to think about the food that land will produce for Ontarians for tens of thousands of years if left alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then he asked everyone to consider the relatively small number of people the quarry wil benefit, most of whom are part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://highlandcompanies.ca/index.php/site/&quot;&gt;Highland Companies &lt;/a&gt;a subsidiary of an American Hedge Fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://longnow.org/about/&quot;&gt;The Long Now Foundation &lt;/a&gt;has a valuable take on time&amp;#8211;or rather, what they call &amp;#8220;deep time&amp;#8221; that offers valuable perspective for discussion about the quarry. The name of the foundation comes from &lt;a href=&quot;http://longnow.org/people/board/prospect4/&quot;&gt;Brian Eno&lt;/a&gt;, Long Now Foundation Board Member, who upon moving to New York discovered that &amp;#8220;here and now&amp;#8221; meant &amp;#8220;this room&amp;#8221;* *and &amp;#8220;this five minutes.&amp;#8221; The Long Now Foundation exists because the enormous challenges we face as a society require long-term thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one expression of their ideals The Long Now Foundation is building a clock they hope will be an iconic symbol that changes people&amp;#8217;s thinking about time. They hope the clock will do for time what photos of earth from outer space did for people&amp;#8217;s thinking about the environment. Over twenty years in the making, &lt;a href=&quot;http://longnow.org/clock/&quot;&gt;The 10,000 Year Clock&lt;/a&gt; is being built inside a mountain in Texas. The clock ticks once a year. The century hand advances once every 100 years. The cuckoo comes out on the millennium. As they say on their website:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #222222; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Why would anyone build a clock inside a mountain with the hope that it will ring for 10,000 years? Part of the answer: just so people will ask this question, and having asked it, prompt themselves to conjure with notions of generations and millennia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-6003&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/6002/the-proposed-mega-quarry-its-about-time/attachment/screen-shot-2011-06-29-at-4-33-33-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-6003&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-06-29 at 4.33.33 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-29-at-4.33.33-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;278&quot; height=&quot;383&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can call it an art project. You can call it a science project. But the thinking behind the 10,000 Year Clock is exactly what is needed to shut down this proposed quarry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not an inventor so I can&amp;#8217;t come up with a crazy contraption that will help folks visualize 10,000 years into the future. But let&amp;#8217;s take Brent&amp;#8217;s advice. Take a trip up to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ndact.com/NDACT/Welcome.html&quot;&gt;County of Dufferin&lt;/a&gt; and grab a handful of Honeywood Silt Loam. Hell, grab some soil from your backyard. There&amp;#8217;s tens of thousands of years of history in that soil and tens of thousands of years of not-yet-grown crops that could potentially come from that soil. It&amp;#8217;s a time machine and a 10,000 Year Clock all in one. It&amp;#8217;s magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In comparison, it makes a pile of gravel seem like a really dumb idea. A gravel pit will rip up the land only to reduce history to a pile of rubble and destroy the land for future generations. I&amp;#8217;m thinking that the Honeywood is the better way to go. How &amp;#8217;bout you?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>From the Inbox: Online influence and Failing at Design</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/online-influence-failing-at-design/"/>
   <updated>2011-06-25T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/online-influence-failing-at-design</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-5938&quot; title=&quot;inbox_new&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/inbox_new1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;226&quot; height=&quot;181&quot; /&gt;I get a ton of content flowing through my inbox on a weekly basis. Between work and personal emails, newsletters always seem to drift down and fall off my radar. Actually, I do scan about 50% that catch my eye, that&amp;#8217;s not to say that the other 50% are bad, it&amp;#8217;s just that, well, I only have so many hours. There&amp;#8217;s so much great content out in webby land that it&amp;#8217;s often hard to filter, focus and internalize all the stuff I&amp;#8217;m consuming. So here are a couple of pieces that hit my inbox this week.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Failing at Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design failures are rarely the result of a bad idea or an unwilling client, it&amp;#8217;s usually a misalignment of expectations. Companies that go into the design process with a clear understanding of the role they play, and a willingness to let their business be transformed by it, typically succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are five of the most common ways NOT to fail at design: ** **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The smartest companies foster an internal culture of innovation&lt;/strong&gt;, which creative consultants can support, but only if other areas of the business, such as management, development, marketing, are also open to change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Designers don&amp;#8217;t implement solutions, companies do.&lt;/strong&gt; The most innovative solution on earth won&amp;#8217;t work if it&amp;#8217;s pursued by a company that can&amp;#8217;t properly execute it. ****&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t design for everybody. ** Most of us agree that a Ferrari is beautifully designed, but nobody would say it&amp;#8217;s for everyone. The same could be true of a minivan. Each succeeds because it delivers to a focused group of users. The most useful thing a client can give a consultancy is a well-considered, focused profile of who they&amp;#8217;re designing for. **&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t try and replicate another company&amp;#8217;s success.&lt;/strong&gt; Good design does more than just serve the needs of its audience, it does so in a way that&amp;#8217;s true to the company&amp;#8217;s purpose and values. An Apple-like experience delivered by a company that isn&amp;#8217;t Apple can&amp;#8217;t be sustained, because it&amp;#8217;s not backed up by Apple&amp;#8217;s culture and resources. Not only does it make you look like a copycat, it shows you don&amp;#8217;t care about your own brand enough to express it in your user experience. ****&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; *&lt;em&gt;It&amp;#8217;s tempting to treat design as a menu of services, applying it here and there on bits of a project. *&lt;/em&gt; The best user experiences are integrative; they make sure that every touch point is consistent and logical and building trust with the user. Piecemeal design work creates an incoherent experience that users won&amp;#8217;t like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Online Influence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online influence is measured so that people can know who to trust. It&amp;#8217;s calculated using online activity, taking topics, audience, and level of activity into account. How active people are on social media platforms in important,  but what really boost influence are good assessments from other people about their online activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a couple of ways of increasing your online influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Create content that resonates with your audience.&lt;/strong&gt; Focus matters. It is hard to be an expert in several subjects, so become known for the subject relevant to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Authentically increase the size of the community you are communicating with&lt;/strong&gt;.  The more people in your online community, the more likely that what you are saying will resonate with some of them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Do not engage in mutual-follow-back schemes&lt;/strong&gt;. Let your reputation spread and let your audience grow organically. Be active; to drive resonance you must be constantly engaging with the people you want to be your audience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Make sure you interact with the people who are retweeting you&lt;/strong&gt;. If they are leaders then they will talk about your product or service the more you engage with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>World Crops Come to Toronto</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/world-crops-come-to-toronto/"/>
   <updated>2011-06-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/world-crops-come-to-toronto</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Teachers know this simple truth: field trips fight summertime malaise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though none of the field trips from my school days were  as uplifting as a recent visit to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vinelandresearch.com/&quot;&gt;Vineland Research and Innovation Centre&lt;/a&gt; (more blog post after video)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I caught a ride with Barbara Emanuel and Seodhna Keown from Toronto Food Strategy&amp;#8211;much better than a yellow school bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time,  folks from awesome non-profits across Toronto were descending on Niagara, eager to plant and learn about world crops with Vineland&amp;#8217;s lead researcher Ahmed Bilal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not often that people from food security, environmental and immigration organizations work shoulder to shoulder. They&amp;#8217;re more likely to see each other at conferences. But on this glorious warm day there were people from the following organizations working together planting calalloo, long beans, bitter mellon, and okra:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kidsgrowing.ca/&quot;&gt;Green Thumbs for Growing Kids&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.toronto.ca/health/tfpc_index.htm&quot;&gt;Toronto Food Policy Council&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greenestcity.ca/&quot;&gt;Greenest City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ryerson.ca/&quot;&gt;Ryerson University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://carrotgreenroof.wordpress.com/about/&quot;&gt;Big Carrot Green Roof&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tdsb.on.ca/SchoolWeb/_site/viewitem.asp?siteid=10204&amp;amp;pageid=11526&amp;amp;menuid=13059&quot;&gt;Bendale Business and Technical Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://accessalliance.ca/&quot;&gt;Access Alliance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And their work was serving an important  purpose. Right now, people in the GTA spend $61 million a month on Chinese, South Asian and African-Caribbean fruits and vegetables. These crops are not currently being grown locally. Rather, they&amp;#8217;re being shipped from far away places&amp;#8211;often worse for wear. So why not grow them here&amp;#8211;giving farmers new commercial crops, and providing people across Ontario a chance to taste fresher flavours from home, or the flavours they&amp;#8217;ve learned to love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a morning of planting and a brief orientation on the world crops, each organization grabbed flats of world crop seedlings to plant in their community gardens and greenhouses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The non-profits&amp;#8217; observations about these crops perform will feed into the documentation Vineland will need to make the world crops viable for farmers to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds complicated. But as you can see, on that particular field the seeds of conviviality were being planted alongside the world crops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Future of logos?</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/is-the-science-channels-surreal-rebranding-the-future-of-logos-co-design/"/>
   <updated>2011-06-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/is-the-science-channels-surreal-rebranding-the-future-of-logos-co-design</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My (web) friend Michael Surtees (&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/#!/gesturetheory&quot; title=&quot;Gesture Theory&quot;&gt;@gesturetheory&lt;/a&gt;) shared a neat bit from Fast Company&amp;#8217;s | Co.Design  on Twitter today that really resonated with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was asking whether the Science Channel&amp;#8217;s new identity materials by superstar motion graphics folks &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imaginaryforces.com/&quot; title=&quot;Imaginary Forces&quot;&gt;Imaginary Forces&lt;/a&gt; were the next step for logos. See the piece then read my thoughts on the matter below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/25212805&quot;&gt;Imaginary Forces &amp;#8211; Science Channel Rebrand&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/imaginaryforces&quot;&gt;Imaginary Forces&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com&quot;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve been advising clients that their logo develops meaning largely based on experiences people have over multiple interactions with their brand. Yes, the first impression counts for more, but a less than stellar initial showing tends to render you less visible, not less likeable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sophisticated aesthetic brand guidelines articulating parameters for every situation in which your logo might be glimpsed are the trappings of a bygone era. Heresy? I bet Massimo Vignelli would say &amp;#8216;roll with the times&amp;#8217;. I also bet that even Coke doesn&amp;#8217;t send out a rep to make sure every truck has the ribbon painted just right anymore. It&amp;#8217;s unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The intended viewers of your artfully crafted logo see thousands of other logos and messages all equally vying for  their attention daily&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  We&amp;#8217;re increasingly living in a motion-driven world, and unlike you, your audience spends more time looking at other images than your logo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  It&amp;#8217;s easier than ever for people to take and use your art for their own purposes, so why not build flexibility in?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And hot damn, isn&amp;#8217;t it a lot sexier than your flat static piece?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kudos to a flat-out cool execution and identity materials that reward you for looking at them. Remarkable–I think that&amp;#8217;s what logos are supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Companies That Need New Names</title>

&lt;p&gt;Wall.E  featured the fictional &lt;a href=&quot;http://buynlarge.com/NewsCenter.html?storyId=34&quot;&gt;Buy N&amp;#8217; Large Corporation&lt;/a&gt; as its evil corporate giant (read: Walmart stand-in)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these companies&amp;#8217; names are the real deal.  Their names could either point to the fact that they&amp;#8217;re refreshingly transparent or blatantly evil. You decide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.giantfood.com/about_us/index.htm?linkid=F&quot;&gt;GiantFood &lt;/a&gt;is a supermarket chain&amp;#8211;btw, their corporate philanthropy is raising money for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.giantfood.com/about_us/community/cancer/index.htm&quot;&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cheminc.com/&quot;&gt;ChemInc&lt;/a&gt; is a water treatment company. Mmmm. Chemical water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yellowpagesgoesgreen.org/Cherry+Hill-NJ/Grim+Corporation/335312&quot;&gt;Grim Corporation&lt;/a&gt; sells furniture in New Jersey. Way to *not *brighten up your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.consumeraffairs.com/utilities/bogus.html&quot;&gt;Bogus Oil Inc.&lt;/a&gt; has had some service complaints. Apparently they&amp;#8217;re not very reliable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you stumbled on any companies with equally revealing names? Chemical, big or untrustworthy sounding? Send &amp;#8216;em along. Photos too!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Airbnb: Finding a Market Between Hotel and Couch</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/on-a-mission-to-change-perceptions/"/>
   <updated>2011-06-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/on-a-mission-to-change-perceptions</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-5873&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/5865/on-a-mission-to-change-perceptions/attachment/screen-shot-2011-06-20-at-3-55-27-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-5873&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-06-20 at 3.55.27 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-20-at-3.55.27-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;501&quot; height=&quot;326&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After fielding about 20 emails from time-sucking craigslist-ers, I rented my home to the first person who reached out to me on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.airbnb.com/&quot;&gt;Airbnb&lt;/a&gt;. Airbnb has been called the &amp;#8220;ebay of space&amp;#8221; because it allows  people to monetize their space&amp;#8211;be it a room an apartment, house, castle or trailer. It&amp;#8217;s user-centric, lovely to look at and most importantly, it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It &lt;em&gt;works *because Airbnb is on a mission to change people&amp;#8217;s perceptions about the *kind *of people who vacation in other people&amp;#8217;s homes and the *kind&lt;/em&gt; of people people who make money by renting out their space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, staying at a hotel was billed as the &amp;#8216;classy&amp;#8217; way to get away. On the flip side, putting your place on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.craigslist.org&quot;&gt;craigslist&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.couchsurfing.org/&quot;&gt;couchsurfing&lt;/a&gt; may be authentic but there&amp;#8217;s alot of baggage associated with that exchange.  Frankly there are alot of people who might find the whole thing a bit too pachouli.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, let&amp;#8217;s just say Airbnb is &lt;em&gt;rent,&lt;/em&gt; without the *scent *(clever, right)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #222222; line-height: 25px; font-size: 17px; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;In short, Airbnb successfully repositions the proverbial tenant from cheap to smart.  And it recasts the &amp;#8220;landlord&amp;#8221; from poor and pathetic to enterprising.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-5868&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/5865/on-a-mission-to-change-perceptions/attachment/screen-shot-2011-06-20-at-2-50-57-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-5868&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/5865/on-a-mission-to-change-perceptions/attachment/screen-shot-2011-06-20-at-2-50-57-pm&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airbnb&amp;#8217;s clean open aesthetic and friendly manner do alot of the heavy lifting in recasting this exchange. But it&amp;#8217;s the site&amp;#8217;s photography that really seals the deal. Photography plays a huge role in distinguishing Airbnb from its pachouli scented second cousins. Imagine this site with crappy photography. All that clean modern design sullied by the handiwork of some iphone happy amateurs. It just wouldn&amp;#8217;t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-5874&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/5865/on-a-mission-to-change-perceptions/attachment/screen-shot-2011-06-20-at-4-02-56-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-5874&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-06-20 at 4.02.56 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-20-at-4.02.56-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;477&quot; height=&quot;436&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Because I have zero patience, I initially uploaded my own photos on Airbnb. Here&amp;#8217;s an example of how my living room looked with me behind the camera. Ok, not so hot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you post your space on Airbnb you&amp;#8217;re invited to access free photography services. You click a button, give some dates you&amp;#8217;re available and moments later you get an email from a real, live photographer who makes a plan to come to your home. When you make it that easy, why not access free photography? So I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-5868&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/5865/on-a-mission-to-change-perceptions/attachment/screen-shot-2011-06-20-at-2-50-57-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-06-20 at 2.50.57 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-20-at-2.50.57-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;319&quot; height=&quot;212&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s how it looked after Max the Airbnb photographer was deployed. Heck, my place looks so good even I&amp;#8217;d want to stay there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-5867&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/5865/on-a-mission-to-change-perceptions/attachment/screen-shot-2011-06-20-at-2-49-10-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-5867 alignleft&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-06-20 at 2.49.10 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-20-at-2.49.10-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;339&quot; height=&quot;239&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airbnb gets that amateur photographers need gigs, pocket money and to build their portfolios. And they &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; that folks want to see themselves as smart and enterprising rather than poor and pathetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quality photography on the site really does make all the difference in shifting perceptions and democratizing monetizing unused space. On it&amp;#8217;s own though, the free photography is a tactic. A clever tactic, but a tactic nonetheless. But because it&amp;#8217;s being powered by a good insight this single tactic works in service of a higher mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, my house is rented to a nice little band from Australia. As long as the place is in tact when I get home, I&amp;#8217;ll call it a Win, win, win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Dancing Crossing Guard</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/the-dancing-crossing-guard/"/>
   <updated>2011-06-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/the-dancing-crossing-guard</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The opening of the Dufferin underpass shone a light on one of the most inspiring people we’ve had the chance to meet. Kathleen, the dancing crossing guard at Dufferin and Dundas gleefully dances as she ushers students, moms with strollers and folks from all walks of life across the road. She dances three hours a day, five days a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meeting Kathleen brought to mind Sir Ken Robinson’s (first) &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/miheWz&quot;&gt;TED Talk&lt;/a&gt; which questions whether &amp;#8220;schools kill creativity&amp;#8221; and more broadly, why society favours certain behaviours over others. Particularly the story of a young ballerina asks an important question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There isn’t an education on the planet that teaches dance every day to children the way we teach them mathematics. Why? Why Not?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kathleen has figured out that she can’t sit still. For some, that would be considered a problem, possibly even one requiring treatment. Thank goodness she remains untreated. Kathleen’s ability to tap into her natural kinesthetic inclination means that she can shine a light on the little corner of the world where she dances and helps people cross the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you&amp;#8217;ll learn from the video, a few simple behaviours that don&amp;#8217;t fit into corporate life help Kathleen find her own way to a fulfilling (and healthy) existence.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Relationships in 140 Characters or Less</title>

  &lt;a title=&quot;t.o.night&#39;s Shout Outs&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-5787&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/5760/relationships-in-140-characters-or-less/attachment/shout-outs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-5792&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/5760/relationships-in-140-characters-or-less/attachment/2-184&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-5827&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/5760/relationships-in-140-characters-or-less/attachment/shoutout&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-5827&quot; title=&quot;Shout Outs&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/shoutout-1024x601.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;594&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A few weeks ago, desperately trying to tap into wireless networks using the password &amp;#8220;password&amp;#8221; had become a part time job for me. As a commuter with a long haul to and from our studio and no companion other than my 2003 model Samsung, not having the Internet at my disposal when in a sea of iPad, iPhone, blackberry and other wireless devices made me itch for that connection.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  That was, until I stumbled upon the ever-engaging &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tonightnewspaper.com/index.html&quot;&gt;t.o.night Magazine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;; Toronto’s only free evening daily magazine targeted to the commuter crowd.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though a short read, t.o.night accomplishes to provide me with a daily fix of the latest news in entertainment, world issues and information about Toronto events, new restaurants, etc. Scanning through the first pages eats up about 10 precious minutes of my time, cramped uncomfortably between bodies on the Go Train. But as I reach the last few pages, a crescendo of interest in me slowly builds to reveal the infamous Shout-Out’s; t.o.night’s most popular section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Shout-Out’s page, readers can write published messages to fellow commuters, rant about whatever’s on their mind, pose questions to fellow commuters, and make various requests at no charge by emailing them to the paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While most of the time it is entertaining- to say the least- reading “BadBoi4Lyfe’s” charming ads encouraging fellow “commuter hotties” to find him to make his trip home “fun timez 4 both”, I can’t help but notice how the shout-outs reveal what is quintessentially wrong with humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world where social media is growing with every new day, people’s charisma and ability to have face-to-face social interaction is dwindling.  Somehow, reading desperate men and women’s postings about their desire for communication with others is quite ironic and- frankly- funny to me when, right in front of them, is an array of hundreds of different people crammed in one space, all trying to pass time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These hilarious Shout Outs fill one or two pages a day, with Jodi Isenberg, t.o.night’s editor in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/04/26/newspaper-lets-go-riders-exchange-love-notes-and-dating-advice/&quot;&gt;National Post&lt;/a&gt; saying,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s a community riding the GO Train and they want to interact”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I get that right? These people want a way to &lt;em&gt;interact&lt;/em&gt;? Try opening your mouth to speak; I guarantee that it takes less effort and time. Don’t get me wrong, many Shout-Outs are helpful, inspiring, light-hearted and/or innocent, but a good chunk of them leave me shaking my head, deflated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While social media is a very helpful tool for businesses and for the vast majority of people who are genuinely not creepy, I think it’s important to make sure that we do not decrease face-to-face interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one can run a successful business relationship in 140 characters. A successful relationship cannot rely on the often grammatically incorrect public posts you make, but instead runs on social interaction; phone calls, meetings over coffee, chats over a cold beer etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should make more phone calls when we could text, pose more upfront questions rather than wait to shoot an email and be careful not to rely on social media as a tie to others, but regard it as a means to keep up to date with those whom we care about and/or are interested in.  And when you have cured yourself of being a creepy facebook-lurking, twittering hobbit, social media can supplement an already successful friendship, business, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I am suggesting is that we use social media very intelligently and carefully, and it will work in our favour. Don&amp;#8217;t hang your dirty laundry out for everybody to see, because, really, you will regret it. Be yourself and don&amp;#8217;t be creepy (yes, I&amp;#8217;m talking to you BadBoi4Lyfe) and use our amazing technological benefits to your advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because while Social Media is your friend, a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; relationship cannot survive and flourish in 140 characters or less.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Hypenotic Among the First Certified in Canada</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/hypenotic-among-first-to-be-certified-in-canada/"/>
   <updated>2011-06-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/hypenotic-among-first-to-be-certified-in-canada</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-5811&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/5800/hypenotic-among-first-to-be-certified-in-canada/attachment/screen-shot-2011-06-15-at-2-39-40-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-5811&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-06-15 at 2.39.40 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-15-at-2.39.40-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;557&quot; height=&quot;341&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1999, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.benjerry.com/&quot;&gt;Ben &amp;amp; Jerry&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; was forced to sell their company to corporate giant &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unilever.com/&quot;&gt;Unilever &lt;/a&gt;or face the possibility of litigation from shareholders. There was nothing Ben &amp;amp; Jerry&amp;#8217;s could do to protect or preserve the social mission it had baked into the Ben &amp;amp; Jerry&amp;#8217;s brand. The company legally had to go to the highest bidder to serve shareholder profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bcorporation.net/&quot;&gt;B Corp&lt;/a&gt;, a new form of corporate designation, gives businesses the legal powers to protect and institutionalize their commitment to social good.   Our client &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fifthtown.ca/&quot;&gt;Fifth Town Artisan Cheese Co. &lt;/a&gt;became a B Corp a few months back. Now, Hypenotic is especially proud to be among the first Canadian companies to do a flying leap (more like a Grand Jeté) aboard this powerful movement. In fact, our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bcorporation.net/hypenotic&quot;&gt;B Corp profile went live&lt;/a&gt; on the B Corp site this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we are signing our official B Corp Declaration of Interdependence&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-5810&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/5800/hypenotic-among-first-to-be-certified-in-canada/attachment/screen-shot-2011-06-15-at-2-38-47-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-5810&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-06-15 at 2.38.47 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-15-at-2.38.47-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;460&quot; height=&quot;445&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B Corp created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bcorporation.net/survey&quot;&gt;detailed assessment&lt;/a&gt; that allows companies like ours to evaluate their social responsibility. Once a company passes the initial assessment they&amp;#8217;re required to change their &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Incorporation&quot;&gt;Articles of Incorporation&lt;/a&gt; to legally proclaim their responsibility to consider *all stakeholders *including the community, employees, clients and environment in business decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, we passed the assessment. Which is great–some of us thrive on gold stars. But we plan to use the B Corp scorecard as a road-map connecting our values with our practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve also made the required changes to our legal &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.incorpdirect.ca/articles-of-incorporation-canada.php&quot;&gt;articles of incorporation&lt;/a&gt; so this is much more than a &amp;#8220;feel good&amp;#8221; proposition. The changes to our articles mean that from this point forward we have a legal requirement to serve *all *of our stakeholders. Our asses are on the line, just where we like &amp;#8216;em.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-5814&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/5800/hypenotic-among-first-to-be-certified-in-canada/attachment/screen-shot-2011-06-15-at-2-49-13-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-5814&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-06-15 at 2.49.13 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-15-at-2.49.13-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;432&quot; height=&quot;463&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one of the inaugural Canadian B Corps we have the opportunity to help define what B Corp looks like from a legal and public policy perspective here. &lt;a href=&quot;http://sigeneration.ca/&quot;&gt;Sig@Mars&lt;/a&gt;, B Corp&amp;#8217;s Toronto home has invited us to join the B Corp Legislation Steering Committee and we&amp;#8217;re actively working with Sig@Mars to help grow the movement in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re looking to better understand what B Corp is all about there are some great articles below to get your started. And, if you&amp;#8217;re ready to go B Corp, let us know and we&amp;#8217;ll put you in touch with &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesvx.org/?page_id=32&quot;&gt;Adam Spense &lt;/a&gt;at Sig@Mars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big splashy event is planned for the fall, stay tuned here for details.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2011-06-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/bringing-your-brands-true-purpose-to-life</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-06-13 at 9.42.37 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-13-at-9.42.37-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;564&quot; height=&quot;517&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend, talented filmmaker &lt;a href=&quot;http://ezsezblog.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Ezra Soiferman &lt;/a&gt;noted my mention of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drbronner.com&quot;&gt;Dr. Bronner&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; soap in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/5668/brush-the-movie&quot;&gt;last blog post&lt;/a&gt; and knew I needed to know about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alloneark.com/?c=home&quot;&gt;Dr. Bronner&amp;#8217;s Interblastive Foam Shower.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the interblastive foam shower is feeding my  long-standing fascination with Dr. Bronner&amp;#8217;s marketing tactics. Whenever I see a bottle of liquid soap in my tub covered with brilliant body copy like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replace half-true Socialist-fluoride poison &amp;amp; tax-slavery with full-truth, work-speech-press &amp;amp; profitsharing Socialaction! All-One! So, help build 4 billion Hannibal wind-power plants, charging 96 billion battery-banks, powering every car-factory-farm-home-monorail &amp;amp; pump, watering Babylon-roof-gardens &amp;amp; 800 billion Israel-Milorganite fruit trees, guarded by Swiss 6000 year Universal Military Training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think of all the advertising execs sweating bullets over a tag line for deodorant&amp;#8211;convinced they have to get it just right to get it to move it off the shelves. Dr. Bronner&amp;#8217;s on-package proselytizing breaks pretty much every marketing rule. And it sells like crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bronner&amp;#8217;s Interblastive Foam Shower is the most truly awesome leadership activity I&amp;#8217;ve ever come across.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/18109352&quot;&gt;All one Ark promo&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/user2433697&quot;&gt;Tim Clark&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com&quot;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Hypenotic, leadership means  making things happen in the world that capture what you care about in a way that other people can care about it too.  For some, it&amp;#8217;s an event, for some it lives online, it can be a great philanthropic partnership. For Dr. Bronner&amp;#8217;s, leadership comes in the shape of  a ginormous bathtub that sprays foam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bronner&amp;#8217;s Intergalactic Foam Shower  parks at music festivals across the US and that&amp;#8217;s when the fun begins. As their website makes clear:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most showers at festivals (if they exist at all) are solitary short experiences, taken only for practical purposes in a sterile uncool environment. The All-One Ark is different: showers are taken with friends, old and new, in a celebratory way to get clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s helpful, it&amp;#8217;s  environmental (one 1-3 gallons of water per person), it&amp;#8217;s celebratory, it&amp;#8217;s community-building, it&amp;#8217;s educational, it&amp;#8217;s art, it&amp;#8217;s marketing.  It&amp;#8217;s fucking amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there was one thing you could do that would show everyone what you stand for what would it be? What would it do? Who would it serve? What would it change?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re asking ourselves these questions of ourselves all the time &amp;#8217;cause at the end of the day, you can&amp;#8217;t just say you believe in it, you&amp;#8217;ve got to stick your neck out and make something great happen. We&amp;#8217;ll be telling you more about what we&amp;#8217;re up to. Tell us what you&amp;#8217;ve got up your sleeve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. I wrote  Dr. Bronner&amp;#8217;s to see if they&amp;#8217;ll bring the intergalactic foam shower to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hillsidefestival.ca/#/tickets&quot;&gt;Hillside.&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;#8217;ll keep you posted.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Website content strategy: It&#8217;s not about you.</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/website-content-strategy-its-not-about-you/"/>
   <updated>2011-06-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/website-content-strategy-its-not-about-you</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We recently finished a content strategy session with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.planetinfocus.org/&quot;&gt;Planet In Focus&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#8217;re redesigning their site to serve their business goals. Strange as it may sound, it&amp;#8217;s a new approach for them. And they&amp;#8217;re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last ten years, brands have been faced with a marketing challenge that never existed before: What content should my website have?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people&amp;#8217;s knee jerk response to the question is: &amp;#8220;All of it&amp;#8221;. Then they set about a lengthy process of organizing everything they could say about themselves. This approach offers a few challenges off the bat:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  It&amp;#8217;s a lot of work, and can often bog down or be an unbearable burden on a web project. Especially since people tend to leave it until the end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  It can polarize stakeholders who all want to see their piece reflected on the home page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  It doesn&amp;#8217;t leverage the web&amp;#8217;s key benefits over print–the ability to assess people&amp;#8217;s interest level in your content, earning the interest of more qualified leads, relevance in the eyes of search engines, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brick and mortar analogy to this approach would be selling your house without &amp;#8216;fluffing&amp;#8217; it. Even if you never baked a day in your life, it&amp;#8217;s worthwhile to pop some apple turnovers in the oven when you&amp;#8217;re having an open house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason is that most people aren&amp;#8217;t interested in you, they&amp;#8217;re interested in how their association with you can help them fulfill &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; interests. If you can help them picture themselves baking away in their new home, all the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing web site content that matters to people means starting with why they&amp;#8217;re coming. Who do you honestly expect to come to your site and what are they expecting to find there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, you can cajole them gently down a path towards your goals.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Getting Serious with Twitter</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/getting-serious-with-twitter/"/>
   <updated>2011-06-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/getting-serious-with-twitter</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-5736&quot; title=&quot;images&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/images.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;228&quot; height=&quot;221&quot; /&gt;Yes, I tweet. But I&amp;#8217;ll be honest, it&amp;#8217;s kinda sporadic and there isn&amp;#8217;t any real plan or strategy to when or how I tweet. I send the love out and spread it around by retweeting interesting stuff I find from the people I follow but that&amp;#8217;s about it. However, with last weeks blessing of Twitter by Apple, who announced at WWDC 2011 (Worldwide Developer Conference) that it had deeply &lt;em&gt;integrated&lt;/em&gt; Twitter into iOS 5, I&amp;#8217;m thinking maybe it&amp;#8217;s time to be a little more strategic about my tweet engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who don&amp;#8217;t know what this Twitter/Apple love fest looks like, it basically means that 200 million plus people with iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices will have the ability to do things like post photos, videos and links to Twitter with a single tap. In summarizing the significance of that, Mashable&amp;#8217;s Jennifer Van Grove wrote,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;[Twitter] will soon be the social layer of iOS, enabling users to turn individual actions such as snapping a photo or reading an article into instant social activities.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s huge. Check. Cool. Check. The tip of the iceberg. You bet. But after reading a ton of  articles on this, the word that seems to pop up the most  is &amp;#8220;integrated.&amp;#8221; And it&amp;#8217;s this that has lead me to think of how to &lt;em&gt;integrate&lt;/em&gt; Twitter better on our own Hypenotic site and those of our clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.twitter.com/pages/intents&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Web Intents&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter released this new service in March allowing site publishers to provide users with the functionality of Twitter follows, retweets, replies and favorites, essentially turning your website into a light Twitter client. The advantages to this allow users to quickly and easily do all of the above without leaving your website or having to authorize a new application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great, now what? Well, it&amp;#8217;s pretty straightforward to implement on your own site and you only need two things 1) a Javascript file and 2) a link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first step&lt;/strong&gt; is adding the Javascript to allow the Web Intents actions (the tweets, replies, follows etc) open in the pop-up window. Simply add this Javascript reference to your page before any of the Web Intents actions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;script src=”http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js” type=”text/javascript”&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#8217;t matter where you add this, whether it is in the &amp;#8220;head&amp;#8221; section of your HTML or just above your Web Intents actions. In the examples I show below, I put the above code right in the body of this post. The key thing is that the above code must appear &lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; any of the web intents actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The second step&lt;/strong&gt; is to add the Web Intents actions. These actions are simply a link to a specific URL. These will vary dependent on the action you wish to use. The result of clicking on the link is a new pop-up window with the relevant call to action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code for each with a brief explanation can be found below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow &amp;amp; Mini Profile:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;#8221;http://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;lionelmann&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;&amp;gt;Follow Me!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using the above code you will be presented with a mini profile and the option to follow your selected user. After &amp;#8220;screen_name=&amp;#8221; type in the users Twitter username in order to display the correct mini profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tweet:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&amp;#8221;http://twitter.com/intent/tweet&amp;#8221;&gt;Send your own message&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This code pops up a window allowing the user to send out a normal tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@Reply:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;#8221;http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?in_reply_to=&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;123456789&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;&amp;gt;Reply to a Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above code will pop-up a window allowing the viewer to reply to a specific user and message. Replace the number at the end with the ID of your own tweet. To find this, click on the time the tweet was sent in Twitter – usually display as &amp;#8220;2minutes ago&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;June 1&amp;#8243;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retweet:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;#8221;http://twitter.com/intent/retweet?tweet_id=&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;123456789&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;&amp;gt;Retweet a Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will let a user retweet your tweet! Change the number in order to change the message intended for retweeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favourite:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;#8221;http://twitter.com/intent/favorite?tweet_id=&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;123456789&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;&amp;gt;Favourite a Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This link will allow a user to set a tweet as a favourite for quick reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on the links below to see it in action&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=lionelmann&quot;&gt;Follow Me!&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/intent/tweet&quot;&gt;Send a tweet&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?in_reply_to=79426710633844736&quot;&gt;@Reply to a tweet&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/intent/retweet?tweet_id=79426710633844736&quot;&gt;Retweet a tweet&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/intent/favorite?tweet_id=79426710633844736&quot;&gt;Favourite a tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us know how this works out for you. With Apples integration, Twitter is continuing to etch out its place in the social media landscape. Get engaged and communicate with your communities of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Brush: The Movie</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/brush-the-movie/"/>
   <updated>2011-06-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/brush-the-movie</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-5671&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/5668/brush-the-movie/attachment/screen-shot-2011-06-09-at-june-9-5-57pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-5671&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-06-09 at [June 9] 5.57PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-09-at-June-9-5.57PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;496&quot; height=&quot;322&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My bath brush has a story. When I douse it in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drbronner.com/&quot;&gt;Dr. Bronner&amp;#8217;s &lt;/a&gt;soap and buff myself silly, I think of this story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought the brush at &lt;a href=&quot;http://mjolk.ca/&quot;&gt;Mjolk&lt;/a&gt; in the Junction which specializes in Scandinavian design. It was made by Stockholm based  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iris.se/174.html&quot;&gt;Iris Handverk&lt;/a&gt; using the same traditions–including the employment of visually impaired people to make the oak and horse hair brushes by hand–they&amp;#8217;ve used since the 1800&amp;#8242;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Mjolk&amp;#8217;s owner, John Baker, who visited the factory, the brush factory is a pretty mystical space where everything happens in the dark as visually impaired workers work by touch. Brings a whole new meaning to the expression &amp;#8220;handmade.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This professionally produced video does an incredible job of showing the process required to make each hand-rendered brush. But it does more. It also mimics the experience of holding one of those gorgeous brushes in your hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video&amp;#8217;s sensuality turns something as mundane as a scrub brush into an artistic and mystical experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s no fetishizing of the workers&amp;#8217; visual impairment. It&amp;#8217;s quietly suggested and respectfully rendered. It&amp;#8217;s about the presence of well-worn hands, not the absence of sight. Which is what you&amp;#8217;d expect from a company that is an offshoot of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.synskadadesstiftelse.se/&quot;&gt;Foundation for the Blind&lt;/a&gt; with a range of other social venture projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s what you&amp;#8217;d expect from a company that makes brushes to suit every purpose you can imagine for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iris.se/1575.html?showFolder=19.51ddd3b10fa0c64b24800010248&quot;&gt;kitchens, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iris.se/1573.html?showFolder=19.51ddd3b10fa0c64b24800010099&quot;&gt;bathrooms, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iris.se/1579.html?showFolder=19.51ddd3b10fa0c64b24800010539&quot;&gt;shoes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iris.se/1581.html?showFolder=19.51ddd3b10fa0c64b24800010665&quot;&gt;outdoors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iris.se/1577.html?showFolder=19.51ddd3b10fa0c64b24800010400&quot;&gt;cleaning&lt;/a&gt;. They also carry brushes &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iris.se/2784.html?showFolder=19.2f448c3b11da7aac4a880004854&quot;&gt;available only by request.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as we advocate that everyone should get themselves a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theflip.com/en-ca/&quot;&gt;Flip&lt;/a&gt; and use it, there&amp;#8217;s a valuable place for professionally made video. And a place for artistic vision. Perhaps most importantly, there needs to be time and space to consider how a video can enhance the experience and enrich the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure the video could be shorter. But so could &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_Peace&quot;&gt;War and Peace.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Just launched: CanadianImmigrant.ca</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/just-launched-canadianimmigrant-ca/"/>
   <updated>2011-06-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/just-launched-canadianimmigrant-ca</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here at &lt;a href=&quot;hypenotic.com&quot;&gt;Hypenotic&lt;/a&gt;, our office has been abuzz this past week. A big part of the excitement stemmed from the focused push to launch a shiny new website on Friday at &lt;a href=&quot;http://canadianimmigrant.ca&quot;&gt;CanadianImmigrant.ca&lt;/a&gt;, the companion to Canadian Immigrant magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project has offered some great insight into Meaningful Marketing at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s worth mentioning that &lt;a href=&quot;http://canadianimmigrant.ca&quot;&gt;CanadianImmigrant.ca&lt;/a&gt; is a commercial property, part of a larger traditional media enterprise that relies heavily on site traffic and page views to drive ad revenue. And they watch their metrics closely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But spend any time with Online Director, Leslie Andrachuk, and her diverse team, and you&amp;#8217;ll meet an insightful bunch who are equally committed to the role they play in championing the needs of immigrants to Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through a very engaging brainstorm early on, we helped the team clarify the opportunities they have to curate helpful content, bring clarity in the midst of complexity, and provide a meaningful space for prospective and new Canadians to build a community. A space to share their aspirations, successes and even frustrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technology that supports the community piece will roll out in the coming weeks, along with other refinements. This weekend we&amp;#8217;re savouring the satisfaction of having come so far already in phase one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we&amp;#8217;re grateful that we&amp;#8217;ve had the opportunity to meet and partner with a team that has the heart and the will to engage their audience with respect and dignity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A team that believes that the surest way to improve their bottom line is to create meaning and value for others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.canadianimmigrant.ca&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-5553&quot; title=&quot;CanadianImmigrant.ca screenshot&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Canadian-Immigrant-scrnshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;CanadianImmigrant.ca screenshot&quot; height=&quot;850&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>@SlowFoodTO: Leaving a twitter account behind</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/slowfoodto-leaving-a-twitter-account-behind/"/>
   <updated>2011-06-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/slowfoodto-leaving-a-twitter-account-behind</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    We learn new lessons every day here. Modern marketing is evolving so quickly that people who don&amp;#8217;t develop an iterative approach can really suffer.&lt;br /&gt; But every once in a while you get the chance to explore something that&amp;#8217;s worth sinking your teeth into. As it happens, the one that&amp;#8217;s had my attention recently was a side-focus. A personal interest. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slowfood.com/&quot;&gt;Slow Food.&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    A guiding interest, to be sure–an interest in food issues is what led Hypenotic to start working with great local brands like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gladstonehotel.com/&quot;&gt;Gladstone Hotel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://fiestafarms.ca/&quot;&gt;Fiesta Farms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ontarioculinary.com/&quot;&gt;OCTA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://sustainontario.com/&quot;&gt;Sustain Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fifthtown.ca/&quot;&gt;Fifth Town Cheese&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.southbrook.com/&quot;&gt;Southbrook Vineyards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greenbelt.ca/&quot;&gt;The Friends of the Greenbelt Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.localfoodplus.ca/&quot;&gt;Local Food Plus&lt;/a&gt; and others.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    I settled on Slow Food because the designer in me was struck by the big hairy challenge of engaging a public blissfully unaware of the danger, inequality, and insufficiency of an unsustainable local food system. Slow Food&amp;#8217;s convivial, informative and flavour focuses offered the lowest barrier approach to making people conscious of how their decisions were resulting in unconsidered, undesirable effects. I think it was initially Jodi who coined it &amp;#8216;a gateway drug to the issues&amp;#8217;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    It works pretty simply–eat, talk, share, enjoy. You&amp;#8217;re hooked. But like addicts seeking to reproduce the first high, proponents need to dig deeper–change buying habits, meet producers, learn processes, participate, advocate, etc&amp;#8230;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    I hit the wall recently, though my addiction for participation wasn&amp;#8217;t sated. Quite the opposite. I&amp;#8217;m escalating. I&amp;#8217;ve recently become a member of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.toronto.ca/health/tfpc_index.htm&quot;&gt;Toronto Food Policy Council&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a Trustee of the newest&lt;a href=&quot;http://awesomefoundation.org/chapters/food&quot;&gt; Awesome Foundation Chapter–Awesome Food&lt;/a&gt;. Rather, I realized that my participation on &lt;a href=&quot;http://slowfood.to/&quot;&gt;Slow Food Toronto&amp;#8217;s &lt;/a&gt;steering committee wasn&amp;#8217;t where I could do the most good.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Here&amp;#8217;s where the learning/sinking teeth into bit comes in. I&amp;#8217;ve been under some pressure to leave my twitter following behind. And I&amp;#8217;m going to acquiesce to that pressure, but not without an explanation to the folks who I&amp;#8217;ve connected with, and not without some reflection that might benefit others. That&amp;#8217;s just how we roll.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    There are two sides to considering the appropriate path here. On one hand:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      The account was called &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/slowfoodto&quot;&gt;@SlowFoodTO&lt;/a&gt;–Slow Food is a trademarked name
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      I told the leader of the convivium (chapter) I was starting the account, did it with his blessing and kept him apprised of progress
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      When we printed cards up, we included the twitter handle
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      There are undoubtedly people who followed it for updates on Slow Food Toronto alone
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      I did this in a volunteer capacity
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    On the other hand:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Twitter isn&amp;#8217;t direct mail, and followers aren&amp;#8217;t a list–it&amp;#8217;s a personal, relationship-based platform
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      I ended up spending more time with it than I expected to (conversations extended from Twitter to Friendfeed and other places)
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      I&amp;#8217;m uncomfortable dumping people I&amp;#8217;ve built personal relationships with–I&amp;#8217;m not a quitter and we started something together
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      I did this in a volunteer capacity (yes, this goes on both lists)
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    The first list was longer.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    In the next few days:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/slowreport&quot;&gt;@SlowReport&lt;/a&gt; will be renamed &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/SlowFoodToronto&quot;&gt;@SlowFoodToronto&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Perhaps more importantly, you&amp;#8217;ll find Paul DeCampo and Carrie Oliver sharing news there to start, perhaps others soon.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      I&amp;#8217;ll share the food information our research continues to dig up through my personal account &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/hypenoticbam&quot;&gt;@hypenoticbam&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      I&amp;#8217;ll continue to promote Slow Values, Initiatives and Slow Food Toronto
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s what you should consider before you&amp;#8217;re in a similar position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  While you&amp;#8217;re representing/promoting an entity in a volunteer position, make sure the person you answer to understands the culture of the medium you&amp;#8217;re communicating in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Consider if clarifying your relationship is possible–can you use your own name? Variations on the theme can lead to challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Treat your contribution like a job–frame out what you&amp;#8217;d like to accomplish and what resources you&amp;#8217;re prepared to commit to get there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, that was fun, and I look forward to connecting in new places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barry&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Etsy vs. Urban Outfitters: What Does it Say About Us?</title>

&lt;p&gt;A small pendant, shaped like a state with a heart in it. What started as a symbol of patriotic love quickly became an absurd icon of overseas mass production and its dark flip side, conspicuous consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you haven&amp;#8217;t heard, last week Twitter exploded when designer and blogger &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/amberkarnes&quot;&gt;Amber Karnes&lt;/a&gt; accused  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/index.jsp&quot;&gt;Urban Outfitters&lt;/a&gt; of stealing Etsy artist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.etsy.com/shop/truche&quot;&gt;Stevie Koerner&amp;#8217;s &lt;/a&gt;necklace design and called for a boycott.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-5479&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/5478/etsy-vs-urban-outfitters-what-does-it-say-about-us/attachment/screen-shot-2011-05-31-at-10-13-35-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-5479&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-05-31 at 10.13.35 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-31-at-10.13.35-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; height=&quot;60&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As a result of the tweet, #UrbanOutfitters was an international trending topic and Karne&amp;#8217;s post—featuring photos of the original necklace and the rip off—was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myaimistrue.com/2011/05/urban-outfitters-ripoff-trending-topic/&quot;&gt;clicked on 260,000 times.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was one of the folks who retweeted her post. I was a bit outraged, but not surprised that Urban Outfitters would capitalize on the &amp;#8220;small is the new big&amp;#8221; trend by stealing artists&amp;#8217; ideas. Turns out this isn&amp;#8217;t the first time, either. In fact, the site &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbancounterfeiters.com/&quot;&gt;Urban Counterfeiters&lt;/a&gt; is dedicated to the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Karnes, it took Urban Outfitters &lt;em&gt;six hours&lt;/em&gt; to come up with this response to the allegations on Twitter. Six hours is a long time in the Twitterverse. Fifteen minutes after Amber&amp;#8217;s post went up she already had hundreds of responses on Twitter.&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tweetdeck.com/&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;Someone at UO was clearly sleeping on the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blog.urbanoutfitters.com/blog/urban_outfitters_responds_to_false_allegations_by_necklace_designer&quot;&gt;Urban Outfitters finally responded,&lt;/a&gt; referring to the Regretsy post and the fact that Koerner wasn&amp;#8217;t the first to come up with this idea. So the fact that Etsy artists steal from eachother helped UO squeak out of a tough spot. And now we&amp;#8217;re caught in a circular argument that comes back to the very idea of originality. Who knows how the idea began and who owns it. And frankly, who cares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than trying to suss out who-did-what-to-whom, I&amp;#8217;m far more interested in what this issue says about us as a culture and our fascination with the concept of originality. Here are my thoughts on what the Etsy vs. Urban Outfitters debacle says about us:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;1. We long for the authentic. *&lt;/em&gt;The idea of the hand rendered item is why&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inc.com/guides/2010/05/sell-handmade-crafts-on-etsy.html&quot;&gt; Etsy sold 180.6 million &lt;/a&gt;worth of goods last year. We still believe there&amp;#8217;s something magical about artists making stuff with their hands. The power and aura of the handmade thing-y resonates. I think it&amp;#8217;s a belief worth holding onto, even if artists sometimes behave badly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Faux Authenticity has a price. *&lt;/em&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve written about &amp;#8216;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/2513/the-lure-of-faux-authenticity&quot;&gt;Faux Authenticity&amp;#8217; on this blog &lt;/a&gt;in relation to Restoration Hardware. The same rules apply here. If you&amp;#8217;re shopping at Urban Outfitters you are buying cheaply made, mass produced crap made at someone else&amp;#8217;s expense. Even if that thing you&amp;#8217;re buying looks so cute, original and funky. Even if they call it &amp;#8220;vintage.&amp;#8221; Maybe it&amp;#8217;s an artist who&amp;#8217;s getting screwed, maybe it&amp;#8217;s a factory worker, maybe it&amp;#8217;s the environment. But rest assured, someone along the food chain is getting it, but good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t feel the same way about buying on Etsy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. The Tension Between Worlds Makes Culture Interesting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** **Urban Outfitters has&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/urbanoutfitters&quot;&gt; 433,561 Twitter followers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check their Twitter stream. Urban Outfitters interacts with its community like crazy—they prescribe what to wear and how to decorate your &amp;#8220;apartment&amp;#8221; (not home on the UO site)—curated the UO way. Their site offers &amp;#8220;room by room&amp;#8221; ideas for everything from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/category.jsp?_DARGS=/urban/catalog/common/highlited_itemcount.jsp_A&amp;amp;_DAV=false&amp;amp;itemCount=80&amp;amp;navCount=&amp;amp;navAction=jump&amp;amp;id=TRENDS_INDUSTRIAL&quot;&gt;Industrial Living Room &lt;/a&gt;to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/category.jsp?_DARGS=/urban/catalog/common/highlited_itemcount.jsp_A&amp;amp;_DAV=false&amp;amp;itemCount=80&amp;amp;navCount=&amp;amp;navAction=jump&amp;amp;id=TRENDS_BOHO&quot;&gt;Bohemian Bedroom. &lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemianism&quot;&gt;Bohemian&lt;/a&gt; and Industrial style &amp;#8220;in a box&amp;#8221; seems incongruous to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out this Tweet responding to &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/iwishihadtaste&quot;&gt;@IwishIhadtaste&lt;/a&gt; (check the Twitter handle. You can&amp;#8217;t make this stuff up). She is also &amp;#8220;Follower of Kim Kardashian&amp;#8217;s Every Move&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-5482&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/5478/etsy-vs-urban-outfitters-what-does-it-say-about-us/attachment/screen-shot-2011-05-31-at-11-08-52-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-5482&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-05-31 at 11.08.52 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-31-at-11.08.52-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;519&quot; height=&quot;80&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;At the same time as @iwishihad taste is taking design advice from UO, Etsy&amp;#8217;s business is booming. They feature over 1 million sellers—some who make stuff, some who find stuff (some who steal stuff, I guess).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can buy clogs from Germany (I did!), a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.etsy.com/listing/74726876/beachside-bag-crochet-pattern-pdf?ref=sr_gallery_35&amp;amp;ga_ref=auto&amp;amp;ga_search_query=crocheted+bags&amp;amp;ga_search_type=handmade&amp;amp;ga_facet=handmade&quot;&gt;crocheted beach bag&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.etsy.com/listing/70764343/vintage-black-cat-planter?ref=fp_recent&quot;&gt;vintage kitty planter&lt;/a&gt; all in the same place. It&amp;#8217;s a relatively unmediated site where people make stuff and people buy stuff. It&amp;#8217;s a DIY spirited movement that tells people they can have their own style, their own &amp;#8220;thang&amp;#8221; and succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it&amp;#8217;s not pure, but nothing is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line is I can&amp;#8217;t help feeling like Etsy&amp;#8217;s success is somehow a reaction to the Urban Outfitters of the world. But is the reverse true? Whatever the case, it looks like the tension between these two worlds is what will keep both businesses in business for a good, long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Your Online Marketing Needs a Goal</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/newsflash-your-online-marketing-needs-a-goal/"/>
   <updated>2011-05-28T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/newsflash-your-online-marketing-needs-a-goal</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Confession: I&amp;#8217;ve always struggled to set big picture goals. But, when I do set my sites on something, my focus is so intense that nothing can stop me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, If you want to get somewhere, you&amp;#8217;ve got to know where you&amp;#8217;re going, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often business owners want to know the number of visitors to their site. They count up &amp;#8216;likes&amp;#8217; on facebook and followers on twitter and are thrilled to watch their numbers go up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the thing, though: The point of all the metrics is not to make you feel good because a million people like you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is to help you determine whether you are reaching your goals online, so you can tweak your efforts to better achieve them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do have goals, don&amp;#8217;t you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s say you want to sign up a 100 new subscribers to your newsletter this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing how many people come to your site each day, and how many of those people sign up for your newsletter tells you how many people are &amp;#8216;converting&amp;#8217; from visitors to subscribers. And how long it&amp;#8217;s going to take you to hit your goal of 100 subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is called a &amp;#8216;conversion rate&amp;#8217;. And armed with this information, you can work on&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  improving the calls-to-action on your site (sign up for our newsletter now, dammit!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  tweaking your design to make your newsletter more obvious (over here, over here!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  improving the content you are using on blogs and facebook (to name a few) to entice people to come to your site in the first place (are you being helpful and useful?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successfully doing these things and more, could enable you to hit your goal faster and even set your sights higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone once said, &amp;#8220;If you don&amp;#8217;t know where you&amp;#8217;re going, you&amp;#8217;re sure to get there.&amp;#8221; The same is no less true online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you know the outcomes you want to achieve, how can you be sure you&amp;#8217;re succeeding?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>So long and thanks for all the well-designed fish</title>

   <id>http://getpoole.com/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-well-designed-fish</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_5364&quot; style=&quot;width: 590px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-5364&quot; title=&quot;photo(10)&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/photo10-580x580.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;580&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    Who gets the mouse cozy?
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it&amp;#8217;s been a blast, but it&amp;#8217;s time to move on. The Art Director is leaving the building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not only leaving the building, but the whole complex. As much as I thought that I would be a designer til the day I die {I didn&amp;#8217;t want to be anything else while in high school; I went to York and OCA for design, and I landed my first design job before I even got the chance to graduate}, I&amp;#8217;m now moving in another direction, one toward the erotic. In 2009, I launched &lt;a href=&quot;http://thekeyholesessions.com&quot;&gt;The Keyhole Sessions&lt;/a&gt; as a weekly life-drawing class. This quickly expanded into photography Sessions, exhibitions, rogue Nuit Blanche events, and it&amp;#8217;s still growing. I&amp;#8217;ve become an advocate for sexual freedom, dialogue and education, and have created a safe space for people to experiment in the marriage between sex and art. So I&amp;#8217;m going to dive into this community fulltime, as I feel Toronto is hungry for it, and hey, &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; has to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned so much while at Hypenotic. The crew here is truly awesome, and I&amp;#8217;ve never worked with people so passionate about what they&amp;#8217;re doing. This studio really does eat and breathe design and communication. Sounds hokey, but it&amp;#8217;s true. The projects have been inspiring, as have the clients. I&amp;#8217;ve had the pleasure of working with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gladstonehotel.com&quot;&gt;The Gladstone Hotel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://chocosol.posterous.com/&quot;&gt;Chocosol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://quinceflowers.com&quot;&gt;Quince Flowers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://camparowhon.com&quot;&gt;Camp Arowhon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://fiestafarms.ca&quot;&gt;Fiesta Farms&lt;/a&gt;, just to name a few. All people who are doing great things for their communities, and I&amp;#8217;m proud to have been a part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s rare for people to say that their careers have been satisfying, and I&amp;#8217;m one of the lucky ones. To be able to learn as much as I have, to enjoy the company of my colleagues, to engage with clients on a personal level as well as professional, and to feel like what I&amp;#8217;ve done has made a difference for many is more than I could ask for. I&amp;#8217;m excited for the new team that is assembling at Hypenotic. There&amp;#8217;s an energy that&amp;#8217;s bubbling and any client that passes through the door these days should be quite happy indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So huge props to Barry, Jodi, Rick, Lionel, Sonja, Rebecca, Risa, Erin and Sabrina. All working hard to live up to the Hype. And if you&amp;#8217;re ever in the mood to dip into the saucy side of art, just &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:peekthrough@thekeyholesessions.com&quot;&gt;gimme a shout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Beau&#8217;s Beer: Being the Difference</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/beaus-beer-being-the-difference/"/>
   <updated>2011-05-25T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/beaus-beer-being-the-difference</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thanks for voting. We were rather blown-away by the response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, here&amp;#8217;s the winning &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beaus.ca/&quot;&gt;Beau&amp;#8217;s Beer&lt;/a&gt; Bottle cap design. It&amp;#8217;s only a simulation, this is only a test&amp;#8211;but keep reading &amp;#8217;cause there&amp;#8217;s much more to the story below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-5373&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/5328/beaus-beer-being-the-difference/attachment/screen-shot-2011-05-25-at-3-52-45-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-5373&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-05-25 at 3.52.45 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-25-at-3.52.45-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;477&quot; height=&quot;417&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, the bottle cap is cute (it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; feature my husband afterall),  but it&amp;#8217;s Beau&amp;#8217;s inspired idea for a silent auction item that really has me swooning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most charity events follow a formula that generally includes an auction. Whether silent or in some cases, very very loud, volunteers work tirelessly to collect items from generous businesses to raise money for worthy causes. All good so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trouble is that once anything becomes formulaic its impact is diminished. What&amp;#8217;s generic gets ignored. And that impacts dollars raised and profile for the organization behind the donation and the beneficiary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By offering the auction winner their face on 100,000 Beer Caps, Beau&amp;#8217;s got the bidding high (raising much needed funds for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.notfarfromthetree.org/&quot;&gt;Not Far From the Tree&lt;/a&gt;) and drew attention to both Beau&amp;#8217;s and NFFTT. It was being talked about online before the&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brewersplatetoronto.org/&quot;&gt; Brewer&amp;#8217;s Plate&lt;/a&gt; even began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked Beau&amp;#8217;s Creative Director Jordan why Beau&amp;#8217;s opted for such a creative take on the silent auction formula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His response shows how much organizations benefit from knowing what they stand for and committing to it in everything they do. Beau&amp;#8217;s brand platform is built on six key pillars:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Local&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Family Run&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Totally DIY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Award Winning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Tasty Beers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Certified Organic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Beau&amp;#8217;s case, the zany silent auction item is a mashup between two of these key pillars&amp;#8211;a commitment to supporting their local community and their passion for being &amp;#8220;Totally DIY.&amp;#8221; The DIY dimension comes from their beginnings in the punk movement and indie musicians. They describe this as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beau&amp;#8217;s has taken great inspiration from these hard-working artists who learned that great talent can still get noticed in a tough market that is dominated by multinational competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, Beau&amp;#8217;s has a commitment to zagging when everyone else zigs. But it&amp;#8217;s not just for the sake of being different. Their DIY ethic means they can figure out how to do a relatively short run of bottle caps with someone&amp;#8217;s face on &amp;#8216;em. I&amp;#8217;d like to be a fly on the wall during a Labatt meeting where they talk through the logistics of an idea like this. Those executives would be frothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the auction item gives Beau&amp;#8217;s an opportunity to leverage the fact that they&amp;#8217;re small and nimble as an advantage over the &amp;#8216;big guys.&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, Beau&amp;#8217;s raised $100,000 for a range of charitable organizations, $30,000 of which came from their massive &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/47654696@N00/5051592446/&quot;&gt;Oktoberfest event&lt;/a&gt; held near Ottawa every year. They threw the community a party and over 7,000 people came out to eat drink and dance last year. This is no small feat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, guess which bottle cap will be ready just in time for this big event? I bet Barry&amp;#8217;ll look great in lederhosen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well well well&amp;#8230; It&amp;#8217;s about time I introduce myself as Hypenotic&amp;#8217;s newest Graphic Design Intern. My name is &lt;a href=&quot;http://sabrina-smelko.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Sabrina Smelko&lt;/a&gt;, although I&amp;#8217;m sure you may already know that (see poster above). I am currently entering my fourth and final year at&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sheridancollege.ca/Programs%20and%20Courses/Full-Time%20Programs/Programs%20A-Z%20Index/Bachelor%20of%20Applied%20Arts%20-%20Illustration.aspx&quot;&gt; Sheridan College&amp;#8217;s Bachelor of Applied Arts Illustration Program&lt;/a&gt;, so this internship is proving to be the perfect stepping stone into the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adjusting to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gotransit.com/publicroot/en/travelling/stations.aspx?station=mngo&quot;&gt;early morning commute&lt;/a&gt; has proven to be the only difficulty in my transition as an intern here at Hypenotic; the friendly and talented crew, the yummy espresso, and the adorable and cozy downtown studio space have made my first week more than enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my first week, I managed to wrangle up some time to finish my first assignment- this blog introduction, as well as the poster I created. I hope you all enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Tuesday!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Making Camp a Mission: Camp Oochigeas</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/making-camp-a-mission-camp-oochigeas/"/>
   <updated>2011-05-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/making-camp-a-mission-camp-oochigeas</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ooch.org/&quot;&gt;Camp Oochigeas, &lt;/a&gt;also known as &amp;#8220;Camp Ooch&amp;#8221; began as an eight week summer camp for kids with cancer in Muskoka. That camp, is now one part of what Camp Ooch provides to kids. But the core values of camp continue to guide Camp Ooch through the next phases of their evolution.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-5076&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/5070/making-camp-a-mission-camp-oochigeas/attachment/campooch_pillars&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-5076&quot; title=&quot;CampOoch_Pillars&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/CampOoch_Pillars.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;288&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;On May 26th, Ooch Downtown will open it&amp;#8217;s doors. Located at College and Bathurst, the new downtown hub for kids with cancer is outfitted with big open rooms to accommodate anything from floor hockey to crafts, a media room, a full kitchen for cooking classes and the pièce de résistance, a two story climbing wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first encountered an outdoor ad announcing Ooch&amp;#8217;s arrival in the city (created by Ooch&amp;#8217;s agency &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maclaren.com/&quot;&gt;MacLaren McCann&lt;/a&gt;)  the idea of a downtown space seemed like an exciting move for the organization. I sat down with Executive Director Alex Robertson and Director of Development Michelle Afinec to discuss Ooch Downtown and what it means for Camp Ooch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-5115&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/5070/making-camp-a-mission-camp-oochigeas/attachment/screen-shot-2011-05-16-at-9-24-37-am&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-5115&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-05-16 at 9.24.37 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-16-at-9.24.37-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;556&quot; height=&quot;565&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Camp Ooch was &amp;#8220;just a camp&amp;#8221; on a rented property 8 weeks a summer, they could be defined by the single &amp;#8220;tactic&amp;#8221;; summer Camp for kids with cancer.  In 2004 Camp Ooch raised funds and purchased land in Muskoka and built a camp of  their own.  Suddenly they could operate year round. This was a re-defining moment for Camp Ooch. Were they still a camp, or were they becoming something else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out another important shift helped redefine Camp Ooch&amp;#8217;s focus&amp;#8211;kids with cancer were surviving their disease, but not without enduring long, hard treatments. While this obviously signaled a tremendous victory, the treatments take an enormous toll on kids who often leave school, friends and normal routines behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Camp Ooch determined that they could serve more kids and still remain a &amp;#8220;camp&amp;#8221; by redefining the very meaning of the word &lt;em&gt;camp&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Camp Ooch, redefined camp, not as a place, but as a philosophy and a social cure for kids with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Camp Ooch refocused their mission and established  4 pillars inherent in all camp experiences; friendship, fun, challenge and magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mission guided Camp Ooch in making decisions about how to grow and meet the demand of doctors, families and the Ooch volunteer base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With their mission as a platform, they began providing &amp;#8220;camp&amp;#8221; experiences at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sickkids.ca/&quot;&gt;Sick Kids Hospital&lt;/a&gt;. Today 350 volunteers work to ensure that there is on-site programming at Sick Kids every day of the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now with the new downtown site, kids from Sick Kids can travel to Ooch Downtown and experience friends, fun, challenge&amp;#8211;and of course, magic like every kid deserves to experience. Yes it&amp;#8217;s because of an engaged community and generous donors, but it&amp;#8217;s also because they, as an organization invested in moving beyond a tactic and getting on a mission that matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Camp Ooch&amp;#8217;s Executive Director and Director of Development gave me a tour around the new place (there were people still painting) Take a look at these impressive digs.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Choose The New Face of Beau&#8217;s Beer Caps</title>

   <updated>2011-05-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/choose-the-new-face-of-beaus-beer-caps</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last month at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brewersplatetoronto.org/&quot;&gt;The Brewer&amp;#8217;s Plate&lt;/a&gt;, a fundraising event for&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.notfarfromthetree.org/&quot;&gt; Not Far From the Tree&lt;/a&gt;, Barry and I went head to head to win an auction item&amp;#8211;our face on 100,000 bottles of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beaus.ca/&quot;&gt;Beau&amp;#8217;s Beer &lt;/a&gt;All Natural Lager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barry was ultimately declared winner of the auction. So his face will soon be featured at an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lcbo.com/entry.html&quot;&gt;LCBO &lt;/a&gt;near you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step in this process is selecting an image to send to Beau&amp;#8217;s.  We&amp;#8217;ve done a few head shots. Curious what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which photo should Barry use for the Beau&amp;#8217;s Beer Bottle Cap? I&amp;#8217;m leaning toward Photo #2. Take the Poll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[poll id=&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;]&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Power of the &#8220;Review&#8221;</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/the-power-of-the-review/"/>
   <updated>2011-05-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/the-power-of-the-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-4901&quot; title=&quot;ThePowerofTestimonials_BlogPost_Graphic&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/ThePowerofTestimonials_BlogPost_Graphic.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;366&quot; height=&quot;245&quot; /&gt;For the past several weeks, I&amp;#8217;ve been in the chaos of renovating a house from top to bottom. It has been an interesting journey especially from the perspective of finding and hiring competent contractors.  How DO you find contractors? Well, you could ask your friends and family, your neighbours or the route we eventually took&amp;#8230;social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m guessing that even a few years ago, social media and the furnace guy wouldn&amp;#8217;t be found in the same sentence. But the impact of social media online, specifically, &lt;em&gt;the review or testimonial&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8211; one of the simpliest and earliest forms of &amp;#8220;social media&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; has become integral in seperating one contractor from the other sound bites fighting for online space in their respective industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the review is so important to their business that we&amp;#8217;ve had two contractors, a furnace guy and a cleaning crew all come in during the renovation and cut us a break on the price &amp;#8220;if only we would write a good review of them on their website or facebook page. &amp;#8220;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the cleaning crew, &amp;#8220;that is how people find us now.&amp;#8221; From a communications perspective and especially working at a company that specializes in social media and communication strategies, we often forget about the power of the &amp;#8220;review&amp;#8221;. &amp;#8220;The only way to combat any negative reviews is to have clients write positive ones,&amp;#8221; says the furnace guy. &amp;#8220;The problem is that people only tend to write reviews when they are not happy and rarely write reviews for good service.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From distant memory, I remember my old college professor saying that it only takes one bad review to counter ten positive ones. Even if you have ten great reviews, if the eleventh is bad it swings the pedulium and creates that seed of doubt in the reviewer&amp;#8217;s mind that might push them to look elsewhere. So, if you are thinking about your social media strategy and how to get the word out try having your clients write a testimonial.  It could be that one thing that separates you from the herd.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Introductory Infographic: Erin McPhee</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/introductory-infographic-erin-mcphee/"/>
   <updated>2011-05-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started my internship at Hypenotic last week, the first assignment that I was given was to write a blog post about myself. Now, I know what you’re thinking- why did this take her a week to complete? What is this girl doing? But for me, this small task was intimidating. I’m an Illustration student; I have no desire to be limited by my background in, well, exclusively visual communication, but writing is something those of us in my program so often forget about during long fevered nights of making images, and drinking obscene amounts of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So naturally, when Barry suggested creating an infographic about myself, I jumped on the opportunity. In this way, I would be able to introduce myself using my skill set, but also be challenged to generate written content. The resulting image is what you see now- click to enlarge, and enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The 99 Percent Lunch</title>

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our fateful leader Barry is off in NYC today at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://the99percent.com/conference&quot;&gt;99 Percent Conference.&lt;/a&gt; The conference&amp;#8217;s tag line is &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s not about ideas. It&amp;#8217;s about making them happen.&amp;#8221; So we&amp;#8217;re expecting him to come back pretty inspired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found some inspiration of our own today. While the boss was away, the entire Hypenotic crew took a Cinco de Mayo road trip to have lunch at &lt;a href=&quot;http://goodfoodrevolution.wordpress.com/2011/04/26/just-opened-agave-y-aguacate/&quot;&gt;Agave y Aguacate&lt;/a&gt; in Kensington Market. Turns out Agave y Aguacate is a living case study in how to make ideas happen and get others to relish the experience of sharing someone else&amp;#8217;s vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had heard about this great new Mexican &amp;#8220;restaurant&amp;#8221; from several sources&amp;#8211;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ediblecommunities.com/toronto/&quot;&gt;Edible Toronto&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ivyknight.com/&quot;&gt;Ivy Knight&lt;/a&gt; and others  I trust. I called up the owner Francisco Alejandri to see if he was open for dinner, since I was considering going there with a friend Friday night. He said he was only open for lunch, so I rounded up the troops and off we went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One step inside and I realized why my dinner question was so absurd. This wasn&amp;#8217;t a restaurant at all (there were no chairs, no tables, not even a stool) it&amp;#8217;s a food stall situated among other Latin American food vendors, tucked into a tiny shop on Augusta Street. It&amp;#8217;s a postage stamp. Boy, had I pictured it differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that doesn&amp;#8217;t mean it was a disappointment. In fact, it was an entirely memorable dining experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First there&amp;#8217;s the &lt;em&gt;red&lt;/em&gt; wall. It sets Agave y Aguacate apart from all of the other vendors that share the space. Their signs are vinyl and the usual standard fare. His just looks amazing. Much of the time I spent waiting for my food to be prepared I spent wondering how the other vendors manage their resentment as the line builds in front of Francisco&amp;#8217;s tiny induction stove. Of course the line had a lot to do with the food but that magnificent wall made this spot stand out. And flourishes like this are in no way incidental. The chef knows the red wall is significant because *every single photo *on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-friends-of-agave-y-aguacate/136407583090840&quot;&gt;his facebook page &lt;/a&gt;is taken in front of this wall. That wall is partly what gives the restaurant a presence much bigger than its physical size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4991&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/4989/the-99-percent-lunch/attachment/screen-shot-2011-05-05-at-1-59-39-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-4991 aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-05-05 at 1.59.39 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-05-at-1.59.39-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;520&quot; height=&quot;328&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a great article written by Kelly Jones for  &lt;a href=&quot;http://goodfoodrevolution.wordpress.com/2011/04/26/just-opened-agave-y-aguacate/&quot;&gt;Good Food Revolution&lt;/a&gt; Francisco commented on the red wall:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want a place that satisfies all your senses. You know, this is why I did the mural. The aromas of the food, and the way it looks, the way I dress—everything, everything has a repercussion to the dishes that I make.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#8217;s the food preparation. I&amp;#8217;m not going to lie to you, it&amp;#8217;s an agonizing wait. As Kelly Jones put it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can come and meet Francisco and sample his fare, but be prepared to wait—even if you’re the only person in line. Each plate is made to order—as in, nothing is sliced, diced, minced, or scooped ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, there seems to be something incongruous about a food stand where the food is meticulously and oh-so-slowly prepared. The wait is outrageous. Under any other circumstances I&amp;#8217;d be incensed. If I was waiting for take out food at some generic joint, I would have left, and made a lot of noise on the way out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But watching the process made the food well worth waiting for. In fact, watching Francisco cook was a valuable lesson in why it&amp;#8217;s essential to have the patience to do things right. Even as the line grew, the Chef kept his cool, never waivering from preparing his food as if it were the first time he&amp;#8217;d ever made that particular dish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phone is always ringing, the email inbox grows; that&amp;#8217;s how business goes. But regardless, it&amp;#8217;s essential to do the job right, no matter how busy you get. It&amp;#8217;s nice to be reminded of it once in a while. Heck, it&amp;#8217;s nice to have deep thoughts while waiting for my lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, while Barry&amp;#8217;s at a conference about turning vision into reality, I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure the rest of us here at Hypenotic got an up close view of what it takes to stand true to visionary ideas no matter what. And, while the Tostadas were incredibly good, watching that happen before my eyes was even better.&lt;/p&gt;

We don&amp;#8217;t want to take the time to read. At the same time we want to know everything  we could imagine at the speed of light. News worthy and useful content has become increasingly accessible; next on the agenda is making content faster and easier to understand. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #444444; font-style: normal; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px;&quot;&gt;So what is the anecdote  to make interesting content quickly digestible? Infographics. &lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4964&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/4908/satisfy-your-information-urges-with-the-infographic/attachment/royal-wedding-infographic3-thumb-600x1874-49404-5&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-4964&quot; title=&quot;royal-wedding-infographic3-thumb-600x1874-49404&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/royal-wedding-infographic3-thumb-600x1874-494044-327x1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;231&quot; height=&quot;721&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; They&amp;#8217;re popping up everywhere and on every conceivable topic. This infographic on the right was created to map the social media buzz around the Royal wedding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The illustration is easy to follow and allows the viewer to quickly absorb the highnotes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Most people chose to use twitter to write about the wedding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The Queen was the celebrity that was most written about&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Social media was consistently sued throughout the entire day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The US contributed to more than half of the overall social media buzz on the topic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had opened Linkedin to find a long article about social media and the Royal Wedding I would have ignored it. But instead, I got a little info-snack that satisfied my appetite for information about the royal wedding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads me to an important question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are we becoming  savvy in our efforts to intake information quickly, or are we simply becoming intellectually lazy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erin McPhee, Illustration Student at Sheridan College, and Hypenotic&amp;#8217;s newest Graphic Design Intern, says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I believe that we exist in a very visceral media environment-  information is often delivered to us in the form of images (we&amp;#8217;re seeing more and more infographics in place of, or in conjunction with print/editorial information.) Undeniably, we now have an expectation for instant satisfaction- if information is not presented to us in a very immediate way, we loose interest. In this respect, we&amp;#8217;re more impatient. However as long as the work presented by  illustrators, artists and designers respects and appeals to the intelligence of the reader, I would say that it is not an inherently bad thing.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Critical question&lt;/strong&gt;. My boss wants me to write a blog post about myself &amp;#8211; hopes/dreams/passions/skills/interests/favourite smell,etc. A little introduction.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;
    I’ll think of it as my coming out. Introducing the new kid -to the club (Hypenotic)- to the world (you at your computer).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4765&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/4763/hello-hypenotic/attachment/picture-3-6&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-4765&quot; title=&quot;Picture 3&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Picture-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;379&quot; height=&quot;461&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Risa Stone&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Communications Specialist at &lt;em&gt;Hypenotic.&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Studied Corporate Communications at Seneca@York.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;About:&lt;/strong&gt; A Toronto girl, born and raised, well actually the suburbs, but close enough.&lt;br /&gt; A -once -upon -a -time thespian, slow -foodie at heart, market goer (Hypenotics very own -Jodi found me at one of&lt;br /&gt; Toronto’s most amazing farmers markets, Wychwood Barns) and lover of the french pastry shops, know as patisseries.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Patisserie of choice?&lt;/strong&gt; Nadege (Queen West.)
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Their white walls and over priced yet perfectly prepared, coloured macaroons just warm my little heart. Yes. Nadege is my &lt;em&gt;happy place&lt;/em&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Skills?&lt;/strong&gt; I can do a cart wheel with no hands (last time I completed an aerial successfully was 2 years ago &amp;#8211; still contemplating another attempt)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Athletic? &lt;/strong&gt;depends on the day.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Relationship?&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Dreams? &lt;/strong&gt;Every night! ( I know what was really being asked of me, but no one actually wants to hear where I see myself in 5 years)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Cynical?&lt;/strong&gt; see above.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Favourite Smell?&lt;/strong&gt; my mother’s house- while she’s cooking soup, preferably beef and barley.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Why Hypenotic? &lt;/strong&gt;They’re picky- and in an era of information overload their commitment to contemporary, meaningful marketing sets them apart.

   <title>Better Blogging: Lessons from a Dumpling Joint</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/what-a-dumpling-joint-taught-me-about-being-a-better-blogger/"/>
   <updated>2011-04-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/what-a-dumpling-joint-taught-me-about-being-a-better-blogger</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4764&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/4713/what-a-dumpling-joint-taught-me-about-being-a-better-blogger/attachment/screen-shot-2011-04-26-at-1-03-41-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-4764&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-04-26 at 1.03.41 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-26-at-1.03.41-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;303&quot; height=&quot;215&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you been to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mothersdumplings.com/&quot;&gt;Mother&amp;#8217;s Dumplings?&lt;/a&gt; It&amp;#8217;s an always packed Chinese dumpling, noodle and bun spot in the heart of Toronto&amp;#8217;s China Town on Spadina Avenue. They have a very unassuming website, no Twitter presence and a very small following on Facebook. But Mother&amp;#8217;s Dumplings taught me a very important lesson about social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the few elements (besides the dumplings) that Mother&amp;#8217;s carried from their former &amp;#8220;hole in the wall&amp;#8221; digs to their new shiny location is a reverence for customer comments. Their walls were literally plastered with hand scrawled notes and drawings expressing an evangelical love of Mother&amp;#8217;s dumplings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4755&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/4713/what-a-dumpling-joint-taught-me-about-being-a-better-blogger/attachment/mothers1-3&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-4755&quot; title=&quot;Mothers1&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Mothers12-e1303836138444-580x776.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;278&quot; height=&quot;373&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many restaurants Mother&amp;#8217;s provides comment cards and asks people to fill them in and provides a locked box to drop them in. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.swisschalet.ca/&quot;&gt;Swiss Chalet&lt;/a&gt; does basically the same thing, nothing original there. So how does Mother&amp;#8217;s manage to get so many comments?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll tell you how: They frame them and hang them on the wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this insight reveal about generating more comments online? I&amp;#8217;ve made the connection between &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.problogger.net/archives/2006/10/12/10-techniques-to-get-more-comments-on-your-blog/&quot;&gt;Problogger&amp;#8217;s post on this subject&lt;/a&gt; and the Mother&amp;#8217;s Dumpling example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invite comments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can leave it open ended by just having that blank &amp;#8220;comments&amp;#8221; box at the bottom of the blog post or you can actually ask people for their 2 cents by asking a question at the end of your post. The more you invite comments, the more likely you are to get them. Mother&amp;#8217;s takes it one step further than Swiss Chalet by getting you to think about your comments while you&amp;#8217;re still munching your smashed cucumber salad (which is divine by the way). ** **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interact with comments left/Reward Comments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** *&lt;em&gt;If someone takes the time to comment on your blog post you should take the time to respond. The most important thing this does, according to ProBlogger, is demonstrate that your comments section is &amp;#8220;an active place that you as the blogger value.&amp;#8221; In the case of Mother&amp;#8217;s, I can&amp;#8217;t think of a much better way of demonstrating appreciation for customer comments than framing and mounting them on the wall for all to see. *&lt;/em&gt; **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Humble&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** **This is an important one, and something that I hadn&amp;#8217;t considered. If you seem like a know-it-all, then why would anyone bother to comment? If people fear they&amp;#8217;ll be shut down it&amp;#8217;s even more likely that they&amp;#8217;ll stay silent. It&amp;#8217;s a fine balance between positioning oneself as a leader and closing the door to interactivity&amp;#8211;which is at the heart of social media. When Mother&amp;#8217;s invites concerns or compliments you get the feeling that they really want to know how they can be better. Check out this blurb from their otherwise content light website:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ours is a cozy, welcoming café. If Zhen seems tired some days, it  is because she cooks her heart to make dumplings as good as her mother makes them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What brings comments to your website? I&amp;#8217;d love to hear what&amp;#8217;s worked for you.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Don&#8217;t Let The Muffin Top be the New Mullet</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/dont-let-the-muffin-top-be-the-new-mullet/"/>
   <updated>2011-04-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/dont-let-the-muffin-top-be-the-new-mullet</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Style4321girdlePink.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft&quot; title=&quot;A woman&#39;s girdle (in pink).&quot; src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Style4321girdlePink.jpg/300px-Style4321girdlePink.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A woman&#39;s girdle (in pink).&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;499&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A shopping expedition to Buffalo drew my attention to the latest phenomenon in women&amp;#8217;s fashion&amp;#8211;the muffin top has come out of the closet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a department store, two very mainstream brands of women&amp;#8217;s pants, namely &lt;a href=&quot;http://us.levi.com/home/index.jsp&quot;&gt;Levis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lee.com/LEE_STORE_US/en_US/home.html&quot;&gt;Lee&lt;/a&gt; were selling clothes that claim to &amp;#8220;hide your muffin top.&amp;#8221; But of course, as the label says, &amp;#8220;Ssssh&amp;#8230;it&amp;#8217;s our little secret.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t know what a muffin top is? Well, thankfully the &lt;a href=&quot;http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0985970#m_en_gb0985970&quot;&gt;Oxford Dictionary&lt;/a&gt; has included it in its most recent edition, defining it as, &amp;#8220;a protuberance of flesh above the waistband of a tight pair of trousers.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time that it&amp;#8217;s out in the open, the muffin top has become a source of shame. It&amp;#8217;s kind of like the new mullet. Whole websites like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.muffinhuntin.com/&quot;&gt;Muffinhuntin&lt;/a&gt; exist solely to shine a spotlight on women&amp;#8217;s abdominal &amp;#8220;protuberances.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s face it, most women with muffin tops are moms. A flabby belly is one of the markers of having bore children. This muffin top hating is a slap in the face to moms who not only bear the responsibility of childbirth but its long lasting effects on their stomachs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though we think of girdles as a vestige from an oppressive past, they were a whole lot more comfy than their more &amp;#8216;modern&amp;#8217; successor &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spanx.com/home/index.jsp&quot;&gt;Spanxs.&lt;/a&gt; Check out this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.moxiebird.com/2011/02/an-ode-to-girdles.html&quot;&gt;Ode to Girdles&lt;/a&gt; in which the writer praises &amp;#8220;the miraculous smoothing effect of what I fondly call My Garments.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#8217;s time to reclaim the muffin top or the girdle. It&amp;#8217;s one or the other people. If you&amp;#8217;re inclined to embrace girdle-dom there are plenty out there. Check out&lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.ebay.ca/sis.html?_nkw=vintage+girdle+vintage+rubber+girdle+vintage+nightgown+vintage+panties+vintage+babydoll&quot;&gt; ebay&lt;/a&gt; or sites like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.littlepinkdress.com/girdles.htm&quot;&gt;Little Pink Dress.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, if you&amp;#8217;re more inclined to wear your muffin top like a battle wound, check out this great video parody of Lady Gaga&amp;#8217;s Poker Face called Muffin Top with great lyrics including: &amp;#8220;Before these kids my bod was the bomb. Now I take my top off and I look like my mom.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which choice do you prefer? I&amp;#8217;m on the fence on this one.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Getting Social with Bufco</title>

   <updated>2011-04-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/getting-social-with-bufco</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I bumped into Arlene Hazzan Green, co-owner of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bufco.ca/&quot;&gt;Bufco&lt;/a&gt; At&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.canadablooms.com/&quot;&gt; Canada Blooms&lt;/a&gt;.  Arlene, whom I initially met through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/bufco&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, was so excited about all of the traffic coming to the Bufco website through social media that she couldn&amp;#8217;t stop talking about it&amp;#8211;even as she ran back to her booth to demonstrate her amazing raised beds for urban backyard gardeners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arlene reads books about seeds and soil, not books by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chrisbrogan.com/&quot;&gt;Chris Brogan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shirky.com/&quot;&gt;Clay Shirkey,&lt;/a&gt; but she has a natural understanding and affinity for how social media works. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s because she understands how to ensure ecosystems thrive or maybe it&amp;#8217;s because she&amp;#8217;s a natural storyteller&amp;#8211;she started out in film and television.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the reason, Arlene gets it. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://bufco.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;her blog &lt;/a&gt;and hear what she has to say in her own words.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Are you Ooey Gooey at the Centre?</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/are-you-ooey-gooey-at-the-centre/"/>
   <updated>2011-04-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/are-you-ooey-gooey-at-the-centre</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We could all learn a lesson from chocolate-bar makers&amp;#8211;what you put at the centre matters most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The centre is where your mission lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tactic is not a mission (&amp;#8220;we&amp;#8217;re an advocate&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;we&amp;#8217;re a festival&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;we sell groceries&amp;#8221;). If you put a tactic at the centre then you forget to ask why anyone else should care what you&amp;#8217;re doing.  You need to take stock and consider why you run a festival or sell groceries, and why does it matter to people other than the few who care because they work for you or they love you (like your mom).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you put the ooey gooey goodness at the core then you attract the right kind of people who dig your particular flavour, texture and ingredients. Then you&amp;#8217;re not in the chocolate bar business, and you can do things beyond make chocolate bars&amp;#8211;as long as the other tactics you choose to do connect back to what&amp;#8217;s at the core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hersheys.com/&quot;&gt;Hershey&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hersheys.com/york/products.aspx#/YORK-Peppermint-Pattie&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was really smart, York Peppermint Patty would be in the travel business. It&amp;#8217;s all about that &amp;#8220;sensation&amp;#8221; right?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Garden Tourism Conference: What We Learned</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/garden-tourism-conference-what-we-learned/"/>
   <updated>2011-04-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/garden-tourism-conference-what-we-learned</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Gardening tourism. When I told people that I was going to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.horttrades.com/garden-tourism-conference-2011&quot;&gt;Gardening Tourism Conference&lt;/a&gt;, their reaction was always the same &amp;#8220;Gardening Tourism. What&amp;#8217;s that?&amp;#8221; I had an inkling, but I wasn&amp;#8217;t sure myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truth is I didn&amp;#8217;t think of myself as a gardening tourist. But the conference reminded me of all of the garden experience I&amp;#8217;ve engaged in&amp;#8211;both locally and when travelling. I go to High Park when the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.highpark.org/cherry.htm&quot;&gt;cherry blossoms are in bloom&lt;/a&gt;; I toured &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chiangmai-chiangrai.com/orchids.html&quot;&gt;orchid growing areas in Thailand&lt;/a&gt;; And my kids and I visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.butterflygardens.com/&quot;&gt;Butterfly World&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/070212/dq070212d-eng.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Del Ray Florida when we head to see my folks every winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, while gardens might seem rather niche, they are a real draw. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/070212/dq070212d-eng.htm&quot;&gt;The Travel Activities and Motivation Survey &lt;/a&gt; found that visits to gardens are one of the top things affluent seniors want to see when they travel. But, it&amp;#8217;s not just seniors visiting gardens. And, gardens are engaging in some very innovative programming to get people to visit regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the real appeals of gardens is that they get you out of &amp;#8220;buying stuff&amp;#8221; mode that so often happens on vacation (even though this may not be what gardening sites with gift shops want to hear) and the money I am spending (on entry fee) is on a social good&amp;#8211;more gardens means more beauty, cleaner air, protection of species, etc. It&amp;#8217;s a win/win. It&amp;#8217;s an authentic experience that is educational and soul enriching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference speakers included a number of luminaries in the field including Pascal Garbe, Director of the European Gardens &amp;amp; Tourism conference, &lt;a href=&quot;http://alanjolliffe.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Alan Jolliffe&lt;/a&gt; from Christchurch New Zealand, Karen Daubmann from&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbg.org/&quot;&gt; New York Botanical Garden&lt;/a&gt; in New York, and our own&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/about-us&quot;&gt; Barry Martin&lt;/a&gt; who presented how the power of social media can be used to increase and broaden the market for garden tourism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was an interesting event, so we thought we&amp;#8217;d share some of our learnings with you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Let&#8217;s change the narrative</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/lets-change-the-narrative/"/>
   <updated>2011-03-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/lets-change-the-narrative</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are facing a point in time when social responsibility and awareness have become crucial, not only for humanitarian reasons but for environmental ones as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Naomi Klein, we need to change the &amp;#8220;master narrative&amp;#8221;; the story we tell ourselves about the way things work in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;It is the underlined assumption of limitlessness that makes it possible to take the reckless risks that we do because this is our real master narrative: however much we mess up, there will always be more&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; Naomi Klein expresses at her last TED presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Soap: The Next iPad?</title>

&lt;p&gt;How indeed could I be sucked into the soap vortex? Who or what nefarious designer or marketer made soap into a fetishistic object?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great blog post that asks why New Yorkers are lining up to buy soap.  You know, soap, the stuff that used to cost $1.50, was 99% pure and floated in the tub?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did we get here? This post explores this important question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/life/archive/2011/03/soap-the-next-ipad/72935/&quot;&gt;Soap: The Next iPad? &amp;#8211; Steven Heller &amp;#8211; Life &amp;#8211; The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Community Building from the core: Wiggly Wigglers</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/community-building-from-the-core-wiggly-wigglers/"/>

&lt;p&gt;I think the way people buy, is to get them to be &lt;em&gt;enthusiastic.&lt;/em&gt; I’ve always thought, people don’t buy on price. They buy on whether or not they care about what you are doing. So, all I have to do is to make you care and hopefully we will get your business! I don’t think people care about advertising anymore&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;A Wiggly Mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer these questions for me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Why don&amp;#8217;t you have a worm composter?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Why don&amp;#8217;t you have tomatoes growing in your backyard in summer?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Why haven&amp;#8217;t you started growing plants from seed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my mind, for those who are inclined there&amp;#8217;s only one answer; because it all seems like more than you can manage&amp;#8211;either it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;too complicated&amp;#8221; or takes &amp;#8220;too much time.&amp;#8221; In life&amp;#8217;s cost/benefit analysis, the benefits simply aren&amp;#8217;t outweighing the costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wigglywigglers.co.uk&quot;&gt;Wiggly Wigglers&lt;/a&gt;, a Natural Gardening Company based in rural Herefordshire, UK has you all figured out. Their tagline &amp;#8220;The Good Life, Made Easy &amp;#8221; sums up the company&amp;#8217;s twofold mission to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Demonstrate that a life in harmony with nature is &amp;#8220;the good life&amp;#8221;–well worth the time and effort&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Make accessing this &amp;#8220;good life&amp;#8221; manageable for anyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way they do this is by creating a passionate &amp;#8216;community of interest&amp;#8217; that brings together the people who are taking steps (one step or one hundred and eleven steps) toward living in harmony with nature&amp;#8211;the good life. These people may be environmentalists, gardeners, parents with kids, urban folks with rural dreams, etc. But, together they form a community of interest who want to improve their relationship to the earth and nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;Manifesting their mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;Create educational resources&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** **The company&amp;#8217;s leaders Heather Gorringe and Farmer Phil provide teaching tools to help people figure out what to do with a worm composter, a birdfeeder or how to plant from seed. Sure that means more composters, birdfeeders or seeds are sold, but their passion for expanding the movement comes first.Wiggly Wigglers engages this community of interest in several ways, all of which are clear manifestations of their core mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out this video (with over 10,000 views!) demonstrating how to get started with a basic worm composter. It&amp;#8217;s not just the content to take note of, it&amp;#8217;s the &lt;em&gt;tone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heather is dressed in her regular, everyday clothes. No hair, no makeup. And there&amp;#8217;s a general sense of good-humor happening as they talk about worm composting.  This is not Martha Stewart with an air of refinement and a layer of distance. These are just plain &amp;#8216;ol people like you and me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, they have an entire &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wigglywigglers.co.uk/cinema/index.html&quot;&gt;Wiggly Cinema&lt;/a&gt; chock-a-block with educational videos that help build one&amp;#8217;s natural gardening skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;Demonstrate Rural Cred&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ve heard of street cred, right? Well this Heather Gorringe and Farmer Phil are oozing rural cred. Their weekly  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wigglywigglers.co.uk/podcasts&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;Wiggly Podcasts&amp;#8221; &lt;/a&gt;are on serious topics related to rural life&amp;#8211;topics that are not directly related to their business–like &lt;em&gt;cattle disease&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;neglected woodlands&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The podcasts demonstrate Wiggly Wigglers&amp;#8217; deep commitment to and knowledge of rural life. After listening to one, you can have no doubt that these folks are the real deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;Building Community&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wiggly Wigglers is all about community. As they say on their About Us page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;One of the best things about buying Wiggly is that you become part of the growing Wiggly Community.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, when you marry the Wiggly Wigglers, the whole Wiggly family shows up and parks their Winnebago in your backyard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s because Wiggly Wigglers is on a mission to celebrate a particular approach to the &amp;#8220;good life.&amp;#8221; Importantly, this is not Wiggly Wigglers grandstanding their idea&amp;#8211;it&amp;#8217;s about creating a forum for the community to collectively showcase how grand the good life can be. Wiggly Wigglers just provides the framework for them to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=3120520301&amp;amp;topic=17477&quot;&gt;Facebook discussion page &lt;/a&gt;where the site moderators bounce questions out to the community rather than simply answering them. This is Wiggly Wigglers&amp;#8217; style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-4321 alignleft&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;&quot; title=&quot;Wiggly Wigglers Facebook note demonstrating community engagement&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-21-at-3.42.38-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;548&quot; height=&quot;258&quot; /&gt;Beyond education, the community is a place for people to share their pride in what they&amp;#8217;re doing&amp;#8211;to get gold stars for taking one step further down the path to natural living.  Several wall posts are simply people declaring how much they love the products they&amp;#8217;ve ordered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-4322 alignleft&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-03-22 at 10.21.57 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-22-at-10.21.57-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;571&quot; height=&quot;157&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And check out the kinds of pictures people have posted of their Wiggly Wiggler stuff–from 1/2 frozen worms to innovative use for packaging. Owner Heather Gorringe is just one member of a community that is flourishing around a shared passion for natural gardening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-4323 alignleft&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-03-22 at 10.23.11 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-22-at-10.23.11-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;239&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between the educational and celebratory dimensions of their mission, Wiggly Wigglers has stripped away all of the barriers to engagement. Suddenly it&amp;#8217;s well worth the time and effort required to take the steps to live in harmony with nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you think of other brands so clearly living their mission?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Twitter help is here: DontPinMyStream</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/twitter-help-is-here-dontpinmystream/"/>
   <updated>2011-03-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/twitter-help-is-here-dontpinmystream</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/h6Zhye&quot; title=&quot;Don&amp;#39;t P in my Stream Twitter advocacy project&quot;&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t P in my Stream&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; project is a public service intended to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Help twitter newbies jump to the head of the class&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Preserve the twitter ecosystem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Be useful to seasoned users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than a little inspired by Merlin Mann&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thanksno.com/&quot; title=&quot;ThanksNo project by Merlin Mann of 43Folders&quot;&gt;ThanksNo&lt;/a&gt; project from a few years ago that was a boon in the early days of email overload, if the project can be a fraction as useful as ThanksNo has been, it will be worth it. Hell, if it gets used at all we&amp;#8217;ll be impressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is we&amp;#8217;ve met clients, employees, partners and peers on twitter and we love it. It&amp;#8217;s been an amazing journey from our first tepid tweets, wrestling our way up the learning curve of a mountain thats shape is evolving  underneath us to a resource we&amp;#8217;re quite literally addicted to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the page, we listed a few twitter basics to avoid like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Tweeting inanity (in an era of info-overload, ‘self-filtering’ is essential)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Promoting your company/organization/client (This is communications dept, not sales)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Telling us where you are or what you’re doing instead of why it matters (be useful please)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  #hashtagging the #hell out of #the #tweet (you’re fostering # blindness)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Tweeting too many times in a short period (clogs up our stream w/your avatar)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are invariably more out there like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Mindless retweets (Without reading the link)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Group #FFs (It&amp;#8217;s generally better to say something informative about an individual)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Group #FF Retweets (that&amp;#8217;s a bit lazy, no?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Personal conversations in public (Overdoing it comes across as a bit needy, don&amp;#8217;t you think?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So do feel free to add your pet peeve in the comments or via twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And conversely, do feel free to make a case for a particular behaviour if you&amp;#8217;re so inclined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you want to politely suggest that someone you follow should avoid certain twitter behaviours, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/&quot;&gt;send them to this handy page&lt;/a&gt;, and let them know you care enough to tell them like it is.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Here I am at Camp Ikea&#8230;.</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/here-i-am-at-camp-ikea/"/>
   <updated>2011-03-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/here-i-am-at-camp-ikea</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;IKEA has always been a very family friendly store. Amenities from parent parking spots to drop-off childcare centers (Småland) to stellar bathrooms with baby change stations put them in a category above all others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During March Break IKEA is hosting a camp called &amp;#8220;Camp IKEA&amp;#8221; featuring face-painting, firemen, tree planting and more. It has inspired me to write a little song about what it must be like to be a kid at Camp IKEA.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All good so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for me, the name Camp IKEA takes this a bit too far. Even though all of the activities offered at IKEA during March Break require parent supervision, the name &amp;#8216;Camp IKEA&amp;#8217; is pushing some buttons and making me feel cynical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s reminding me March Break is one of the few times that kids are out of school and available to hang out with their friends and their folks and have fun.  When you say &amp;#8216;camp&amp;#8217; I think of a place that is child-centered, not a grownup place that manages to keep kids amused while parents shop.&amp;lt;!--more--&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankly, the words &amp;#8220;Camp&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;IKEA&amp;#8221; together make it seem pathetic that parents would schlep their kids to IKEA during this particular week. In short, it&amp;#8217;s making me more cynical than I want to be about IKEA&amp;#8217;s intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4290&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/4275/here-i-am-at-camp-ikea/attachment/screen-shot-2011-03-15-at-1-30-47-pm-2&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4290&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-03-15 at 1.30.47 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-15-at-1.30.47-PM1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;614&quot; height=&quot;657&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IKEA wants me to think nice, Swedish thoughts about equality, and love and goodness. I think a name like Smalstuff, or Smalfun would make IKEA seem like less of a shopping enabler and more like a helpful friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy March Break.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How Do You Crunch it?</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/how-do-you-crunch-it/"/>

  Today &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foodshare.net/school-crunch.htm&quot;&gt;FoodShare &lt;/a&gt;is having it&amp;#8217;s ‘Great Big Crunch’ event where students and teachers are invited to learn about healthy eating and local and global food systems.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those of us who support good food and the work of organizations like Foodshare were invited to crunch along with school kids and teachers and snap photos of ourselves digging in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the folks at Hypenotic striking a pose and doing our part for a healthy food system, the environment,  our health, our local economy and for our bellies.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>It&#8217;s Wipe Nothing Day</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/its-wipe-nothing-day/"/>

  &lt;p&gt;
    The latest incarnation of wipes, called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boogiewipes.com/&quot;&gt;Boogie wipes&lt;/a&gt;, saline wipes that &amp;#8220;dissolve boogers,&amp;#8221; had me thinking about all of the various wipes we use and how they create meaningless landfill&amp;#8211;all part of our &amp;#8220;use and toss&amp;#8221; culture of convenience.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    So, I declare today &lt;strong&gt;Wipe Nothing Day.&lt;/strong&gt; Of course you&amp;#8217;ll need to wipe some things, but please, keep it to a necessary limit.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    And for more on the implications of wipes + just how many we use check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greenhome.com/info/news/125.shtml&quot;&gt;this article &lt;/a&gt;that probes the issue even further.

   <title>Lunch Money Day</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/lunch-money-day/"/>
   <updated>2011-03-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/lunch-money-day</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I always thought &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.secondharvest.ca/&quot;&gt;Second Harvest&amp;#8217;s Lunch Money Day &lt;/a&gt;was a great idea. It&amp;#8217;s one of those great fundraising ideas the involve asking folks to do something they would normally do&amp;#8211;but to do it differently for a great cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fact is, the average person in Toronto spends at least $5 on lunch every day. For most of us it&amp;#8217;s a convenience we take for granted. So, for one day we manage without the convenience of a bought lunch and divert resources to Toronto&amp;#8217;s hungry. If you think brown bagging it is inconvenient, just think about eating baked potatoes for two weeks. That&amp;#8217;s just one story out of the just released &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestar.com/news/article/947468--hunger-on-the-rise-in-canada-report-warns&quot;&gt;Recession Relief Coalition report. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, on Lunch Money day myself and my companion Agata hit the subway platform  to round up some fundraising dollars and drum up some awareness. I was there with several other eager volunteers who woke up much too early to make a difference. Here&amp;#8217;s a short video about our experience that day.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Podcamp Toronto 2011: My biggest lesson</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/podcamp-toronto-2011-my-biggest-lesson/"/>
   <updated>2011-02-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/podcamp-toronto-2011-my-biggest-lesson</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, the first day of &lt;a href=&quot;http://2011.podcamptoronto.com/&quot;&gt;Podcamp Toronto 201 1&lt;/a&gt;, Lionel, our Lead digital designer/dev sent me about 20 emails from the sessions he was in. Not about what people were saying, but about what his brain was saying, catalysed by what he was hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read his notes from my couch, where I was working on a proposal (not even with my family!). Work is more important than inspiration right? Well, I shouldn&amp;#8217;t put it that way. I&amp;#8217;m inspired daily by things I read, people I work with and the flashes of insight that come to me every time I walk to/from work or to the bathroom (everyone walks out of our bathrooms with an idea. Try it!) daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I rarely go to conferences with my peers.  I&amp;#8217;ve been attending and speaking at conferences focussed on my client&amp;#8217;s issues. Since we have many clients in the food and social justice space, this can be yummy and rewarding. But in the few hours I caught today, I:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Heard &lt;a href=&quot;http://2011.podcamptoronto.com/sked/view_entry.php?id=620&amp;amp;area=4&amp;amp;day=27&amp;amp;month=2&amp;amp;year=2011&quot; title=&quot;THE KICK-ASS WOMEN OF NEW &amp;amp; SOCIAL MEDIA panel at Podcamp Toronto 2011&quot;&gt;5 dynamic women&lt;/a&gt; lay out the trials of a bringing  a strategic approach to big brand marketing in a digital era as well as their thoughts on the opportunities ahead of us (worth a whole post in and of itself)  in THE KICK-ASS WOMEN OF NEW &amp;amp; SOCIAL MEDIA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Caught a state of the union update on what big companies like Edelman are thinking about measurement (ditto the last brackets, maybe two posts) from Rob Clark, one of the few folks you&amp;#8217;ll meet with the word &amp;#8216;measurement&amp;#8217; in his job title&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Connected with about 2o smart, interesting folks I intend to keep up with, and re-connected with 5 I haven&amp;#8217;t seen in a while&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Picked up 15 new twitter followers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Learned that for folks in a virtual vacuum, we&amp;#8217;re on top of our shit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Enjoyed being in rooms full of people who were interested in tactics, but knew they were in service to a strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Connected with an old acquaintance who happens to need a mobile app with features we&amp;#8217;ve been testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Connected with a community of interest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me over an hour (with a stop at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.porchettaco.com/&quot;&gt;Porchetta&lt;/a&gt;), but I walked the whole way home just to keep the wheels turning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several conferences who&amp;#8217;s douche-factor I can still taste when I think about them, so the jury&amp;#8217;s still out on how much energy I can devote to communing with the communications industry at large. But the experience I had today made it pretty clear that there&amp;#8217;s plenty of value in bouncing ideas off people facing the same challenges you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s nice to spend a day when you&amp;#8217;re not expected to have all the answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, Podcamp.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With the announcement today of &lt;a href=&quot;http://mashable.com/2011/02/25/google-content-farms/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google&amp;#8217;s major algorithmic change&lt;/a&gt; to its search engine we are, once again, back in the land where good content reigns supreme.  &lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4161&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/4160/content-is-king-again/attachment/good-content&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-4161&quot; title=&quot;good-content&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/good-content.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;294&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Like weeds in your garden, websites that have something useful to say and a story to tell have been suffering in page rank to &lt;em&gt;the others&lt;/em&gt; that stuff, steal and copy content in order to &amp;#8220;game&amp;#8221; the system in the hopes of getting to that all elusive #1 Google search result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one commenter on Mashable says, Bring it on, my site is ready&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s simple. It doesn&amp;#8217;t matter if you&amp;#8217;re writing content for a social media campaign, a blog post, a newsletter or website, if it ain&amp;#8217;t quality don&amp;#8217;t write it. If one of the worlds biggest companies is touting and investing in the importance of quality content, that should say something. Content is still King. If you don&amp;#8217;t know how to be King, check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.copyblogger.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;copyblogger&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2009/08/20-tips-on-how-to-write-for-the-web&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;20 tips on how to write for the web&lt;/a&gt; to get you started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Google gets it right, the ubiquitous &amp;#8220;we&amp;#8221; will spend less time searching and more time consuming quality.  It&amp;#8217;s about time.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>I choose choice</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/your-food-your-choice/"/>
   <updated>2011-02-24T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/your-food-your-choice</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was Friday night and I was on my way home from a meeting with my friend Eugene, an extremely talented violin player better known as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myspace.com/doctordraw&quot;&gt;Dr. Draw&lt;/a&gt;. Amongst the things we discussed, we talked about the possibility of him playing for a&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beadsforbeds.com&quot;&gt; Beads for Beds &lt;/a&gt;event; the organization I&amp;#8217;m directing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I entered Ossington station and was overwhelmed by a group of teenagers on the opposite platform that were yelling at each other, obviously intoxicated. A man on a long black coat shifted a Rubik&amp;#8217;s cube in his hands at a speed that fascinated me and it gave me the feeling that some invisible force was directing the whole scene. People&amp;#8217;s public behavior changes on Friday nights and me, I was the silent and oblivious participant of many stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amongst the over-excited voices of intoxicated youth, I sat and observed the string of ads above the passenger&amp;#8217;s heads. All of a sudden I became disenchanted, the feeling of oblivion was gone. One after the other, the signs seemed to be telling me what to do. &amp;#8220;Build your own box&amp;#8221; the ad for Taco Bell read. Right next to it, &amp;#8220;Share the good&amp;#8221; -Foodland Ontario. &amp;#8220;Look no further&amp;#8221; -French Education board. &amp;#8220;Transfer some money at your next transfer&amp;#8221; -RBC. &amp;#8220;Protect yourself from the flu&amp;#8221; -Government of Canada- Okey, at least they care about my health, right?. &amp;#8220;Turn yous passion into a career&amp;#8221; -Ontario Government. &amp;#8220;Change your life&amp;#8221; -some book of self-help. And finally, the BIG punch: &amp;#8220;Do you need a psychiatrist?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yes, you are crazy. You are also fat, ignorant, unhealthy and have no idea what to do with your life.  So let us tell you what to eat, what to wear, what to smell like and what to do with your time. I looked at the ads with perplexity, realizing how many subliminal messages we are being force-fed daily. I wonder if I&amp;#8217;m the only one noticing that all these ads have one thing in common: they all start with a verb. A verb! What does that mean? Advertisement today does not work as suggestions, they are commandments; at least so it seems&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the bus from Dufferin to King the same scenario. One thing was different though. Amongst all the ads telling me what to do, one stood out from the crowd; it was from Centennial College. &amp;#8220;What did you want to be? Over 250 programs to help you become what and who you always wanted to be&amp;#8221; It was a reminder that we still have a choice&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a video on The Command Economy. Humor is the key&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

  Hi &amp;#8211; I just told Michael Pollan what my food rule is. He&amp;#8217;s writing a new edition of his book, and has asked for our input. &lt;p /&gt;
  Check out his email below &amp;#8211; you could win a signed copy, or even have your rule appear in print! 
  &lt;p /&gt;
  &amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8211; Email from Michael Pollan &amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;- 
  &lt;p /&gt;
  Hi, 
  &lt;p /&gt;
  Last year I published Food Rules, a short book offering 64 rules for eating well. Food Rules struck a chord with many people, who found that it helped them navigate what has become a treacherous food environment, whether in the supermarket or restaurant. Many of the rules were submitted by readers, and since publication I have received a number of excellent new ones. 
  &lt;p /&gt;
  So I’ve decided to publish an expanded edition, with additional rules and also illustrations, which the painter Maira Kalman has agreed to create. I hope you’ll consider contributing to the new book. 
  &lt;p /&gt;
  What are some of your food rules? I’ll pick 3 submitted by people within the Slow Food network to receive signed copies of the book. 
  &lt;p /&gt;
  Let me know your food rule here: 
  &lt;p /&gt;
  
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://org2.democracyinaction.org/o/5986/p/salsa/web/questionnaire/public/?questionnaire_KEY=541&quot;&gt;http://org2.democracyinaction.org/o/5986/p/salsa/web/questionnaire/public/?qu&amp;#8230;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p /&gt;
  Thanks in advance for your help,
  &lt;br /&gt;Michael Pollan &lt;p /&gt;
  PS the deadline for submission is February 27th

   <title>Fuck The Draft!</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/4132/"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4135&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/4132/4132/attachment/screen-shot-2011-02-23-at-11-06-59-am&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-4135 alignleft&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-02-23 at 11.06.59 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Screen-shot-2011-02-23-at-11.06.59-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;199&quot; height=&quot;304&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his book &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trustagent.com/&quot;&gt;Trust Agents&lt;/a&gt;, Chris Brogan says &amp;#8220;Building an army, especially a loosely-joined and flexible group of people from many disciplines, is the key to being an advanced trust agent.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course everyone wants to build an army&amp;#8211;a mass of followers from all walks of life. But the critical question is &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; you start building your army. You don&amp;#8217;t want to start asking folks to join you when you need something from them. That&amp;#8217;s called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription&quot;&gt;conscription&lt;/a&gt; and it&amp;#8217;s not generally popular. Social networking platforms don&amp;#8217;t allow for conscription&amp;#8211;so folks often resort to tactics like guilt, pleading and invoking a sense of duty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, being useful and relevant&amp;#8211;giving not taking&amp;#8211;is key to enlist people in a cause that is bigger than yourself; your event, your cause, your services, and whatever else you&amp;#8217;re trying to sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two authors, Rebecca Skloot and James Beckerman, both with wildly successful books, started sharing and building communities of interest long before they ever had books to sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skloot&amp;#8217;s ten year journey to write her book &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.ca/Immortal-Life-Henrietta-Lacks/dp/1400052173&quot;&gt;The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks&lt;/a&gt; was thoughtfully chronicled by the author who let her community in on what she was was discovering while getting to know Henrietta Lacks, the impoverished African American woman whose HeLa cells transformed modern medicine. Skloot turned the process inside out and engaged her readers long before there was ever a book. She talked about a broad range of issues on science and ethics&amp;#8211;the core area of exploration in her book. Today she has over &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/rebeccaskloot&quot;&gt;eleven thousand followers on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; not to mention a best selling book that has been optioned as an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/12/oprah-to-produce-immortal_n_573647.html&quot;&gt;HBO film by Oprah Winfrey.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another writer that I&amp;#8217;ve been watching for sometime is Portland Cardiologist James Beckerman who just launched his book &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theflexdiet.com/&quot;&gt;The Flex Diet.&lt;/a&gt; Just yesterday Canadian doctor  and blogger  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weightymatters.ca/&quot;&gt;Yoni Freedhoff&lt;/a&gt; reviewed the book, calling Beckerman &amp;#8220;a socially networked cardiologist.&amp;#8221; The point is, long before there was a book, Beckerman was sharing useful tips, tools and resources that helped people lose weight. Twitter was the perfect medium for sharing small tips on weight management, which is the premise of the Flex Diet.  Today Beckerman has written over 2,700 tweets and has over a thousand followers. So when his book finally launched, lots of folks were already fans of his approach to weight management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is this; Don&amp;#8217;t start your social networking journey when you are ready to ask people to do something for you. Don&amp;#8217;t start making friends so you have people to invite to your birthday party.  People who like you want to celebrate your achievements&amp;#8211;but they need to know you first. So, what can you share that would help people get engaged in the mission you&amp;#8217;re on long before you have anything to ask of them? What &amp;#8216;bits&amp;#8217; of your journey would be useful and relevant to others? The time to get started is now.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft&quot; title=&quot;Women can&quot; src=&quot;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/images.owni.fr/pub_vintage_049.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;360&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;Researching advertising I came across a website listing the top vintage ads that can make one&amp;#8217;s jaw drop in disbelief. &lt;a href=&quot;http://owni.eu/2010/11/08/top-48-ads-that-would-never-be-allowed-today/&quot;&gt;The images are worth a million words.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder which of today&amp;#8217;s ads people will consider sexist, racist, or inappropriate 50 years from now. Maybe they&amp;#8217;ll even come up with new categories all together, like &amp;#8220;too humane&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;AI-cist&amp;#8221; (discrimination against Artificial Intelligence)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of A.I. &amp;#8230; The technological advancements of the current era are far beyond extraordinary. One of the latest developments in Artificial Intelligence is a computer called Watson, developed by IBM to compete on Jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Watson is powered by 10 racks of IBM servers running the Linux operating system. It&amp;#8217;s not connected to the internet but has digested encyclopedias, dictionaries, books, news, movie scripts and more.&amp;#8221; (source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2011/01/14/computer-jeopardy.html#ixzz1EFAjbG1w&quot;&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2011/01/14/computer-jeopardy.html#ixzz1EFAjbG1w&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During its first public appearance in Jeopardy, Watson was put to the test against the two game-show&amp;#8217;s champions, where he proved that to err is to be non-human&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A formal introduction&#8230;</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/an-introduction/"/>
   <updated>2011-02-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this sunny Tuesday morning I&amp;#8217;d like for you to help me welcome the latest addition to Hypenotic&amp;#8230; myself! Yes, me, Agata. I&amp;#8217;m super excited to become part of such wonderful team of creative people who are bursting with ideas, amazing energy and the drive to have a positive impact on the community through meaningful marketing. So, let&amp;#8217;s get down to business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Agata Ivanna Pogorelsky and I was born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina. At age 18 -now you want to know how old I am, right?- I moved to Canada, landing in the coldest place I could have ever imagined: Winnipeg. After a year at University of Manitoba, in the Fine Arts program, I moved to Toronto to pursue my acting a career. Ryerson Theater School was a wonderful experience but the language barrier was too big at the time to continue three more years of studies. In 2006, I dropped out of the program and got accepted into the School of Image Arts, which gave me enough flexibility to experiment, play and learn about all the things that excite me, such as photography, video editing, graphic arts and of course, performance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My work experience is as broad as Winnipeg&amp;#8217;s annual thermal amplitude: I have waited tables, administered offices, driven trucks, filmed and edited music videos for local bands and fashion shows, cleaned houses, animated typography for multi-media theater plays, photographed events as a free-lancer-for-free, taught Spanish, etc, etc, etc; you get my point. I&amp;#8217;m extremely delighted to embark on a journey as part of Hypenotic&amp;#8217;s staff, where I will be able -and encouraged- to combine my various skills and talents working for clients that are doing things that matter to people. Talk about meaningful marketing, eh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how about I give you a little something and introduce you to my alter-ego Fatima Popolopulis? Turn your speakers on and embrace yourself as you join me on a journey to the depths of the Giraffe Center in Nairobi, Kenya. Karibu!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to hire someone to tweet for you</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/how-to-hire-someone-to-tweet-for-you/"/>
   <updated>2011-02-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/how-to-hire-someone-to-tweet-for-you</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me start by saying that having someone tweet for you is almost never a good idea. &lt;a href=&quot;http://technews.am/conversations/geek-sugar/daily_tech_kenneth_coles_twitter_fiasco_spawns_parody_tweets&quot; title=&quot;Kenneth Cole Twitter Fiasco&quot;&gt;Kenneth Col&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://technews.am/conversations/geek-sugar/daily_tech_kenneth_coles_twitter_fiasco_spawns_parody_tweets&quot;&gt;e&lt;/a&gt; can tell you more about the dangers. So can &lt;a href=&quot;http://rotolo.syr.edu/2010/09/the-price-chopper-situation/&quot; title=&quot;Price Chopper Twitter fiasco&quot;&gt;Price Chopper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, there are only a few situations that make a ghost-tweeter a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The person in question is identified as a separate entity, brings you credibility,  and is responsible for community management–that is, they&amp;#8217;re hired to implement a communications strategy that partly manifests on  twitter. An example here is &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/#!/fiestafarms&quot; title=&quot;Fiesta Farms on Twitter&quot;&gt;Ivy Knight&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; work on &lt;a href=&quot;fiestafarms.ca&quot; title=&quot;Fiesta Farms website&quot;&gt;Fiesta Farms&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/#!/ontariosown&quot; title=&quot;Ontarios Own on twitter&quot;&gt;Jodi&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; work for &lt;a href=&quot;http://ontariosown.com/&quot; title=&quot;Ontario&amp;#39;s own website&quot;&gt;Ontario&amp;#8217;s Own&lt;/a&gt;. They each do a lot more than tweet. And it&amp;#8217;s never about themselves unless they believe the info useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; It&amp;#8217;s your corporate account, you have multiple voices–but even then they should be identifiable somewhere, in a blog post, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; You&amp;#8217;re a trouble maker like Guy Kawasaki and &lt;a href=&quot;http://subscribersrule.com/?p=488&quot; title=&quot;Guy Kawasaki&amp;#39;s twitter spam approach&quot;&gt;gaming the system&lt;/a&gt; while you can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; It&amp;#8217;s promotional–Sonya here just mentioned a tattoo parlour that has a guest tweeter for a week. Fun stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; I&amp;#8217;m open to more, do share.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When is it a particularly bad idea?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you hire some random self-styled social media guru without a communications strategy, a metrics tracking plan, or check-ins to assess the influence of their work. You can tell these people because they call themselves experts (if they see the word &amp;#8216;guru&amp;#8217;, please throw something wet at them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media marketing is new. We&amp;#8217;re really five years into developing pragmatic approaches and measuring the right performance indicators. We have a leg up from the amazing work done in the Search Engine Optimization universe, but that space evolves quickly as well. And frankly, the world of websites is also being affected by expectations people develop from their experiences on social platforms and mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problems range from wasting your money on a hamster wheel you&amp;#8217;re paying someone else to get fit on to turning people off with inanity. It&amp;#8217;s honestly mind-blowing in an era where &lt;a href=&quot;http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+not+to+use+twitter&quot; title=&quot;search on how not to use twitter&quot;&gt;a quick search will help you avoid the most established pitfalls&lt;/a&gt; that these amount of inanity on twitter persists. These people are dropping small turds all over the internet and stamping your brand on them. Repulsive? Now you&amp;#8217;re getting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The barrier to a decent tweet is just SO fucking low. The notion that someone being paid to represent your organization can&amp;#8217;t come up with more than an encouragement to buy your product is an offense that paints all marketers. We&amp;#8217;ve just got the twitter canard about &amp;#8220;doing your laundry&amp;#8221; or what people ate for dinner&amp;#8221; in the rear view mirror and these &amp;#8216;pros&amp;#8217; show up and drop a load on the windshield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m uncomfortable calling out local brands on this (though I might start soon), this is after all, supposed to be instructive. So here&amp;#8217;s what to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Only talk to prospective representers who&amp;#8217;s work you know and like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; If you don&amp;#8217;t know anyone and don&amp;#8217;t know the space well enough to assess, get a referral from someone who does.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Make sure they get what you stand for. If an honest self-assessment suggests this knowledge must be developed, hire someone who can help you with it (If you&amp;#8217;re doing something that doesn&amp;#8217;t suck, try us).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Learn how to create a useful presence on twitter, from your profile image and bio to who you should be connecting with on what topics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Help other people. It&amp;#8217;s a community. You become popular by being useful. The more useful you are to more influential people, the better you&amp;#8217;re doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Define specifically who you&amp;#8217;d like to be building relationships with and why.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Define ways to learn from and iterate on your attempts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your designated tweeter isn&amp;#8217;t doing this strategically, they&amp;#8217;re polluting the twitter stream of those too lazy to unfollow them with irrelevance. It would be great if your brand could become part of the solution instead of the problem. Hell that&amp;#8217;s a good strategy right there–call it meaningful marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do feel free to fire back. This rant is over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A not-so-great talk was topped off with an awkward conversation at the end of the event. Please, indulge me because I think it exemplifies what happens when old thinking crashes headlong into new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty skinny blonde advertising type working the event approaches. She asks &amp;#8220;did you like it?&amp;#8221;&amp;#8211; meaning did I like the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Yeah, it was good&amp;#8221; I say, reaching for a morsel of fresh fruit. It wasn&amp;#8217;t very good. But I don&amp;#8217;t want to talk about it. Not now and not with her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She asks &amp;#8220;Do you* have *Twitter?&amp;#8221; The way she asked tipped me off that this was not going to end well. I would ask someone &amp;#8220;Do you Tweet?&amp;#8221; not &amp;#8220;Do you have Twitter?&amp;#8221; Sorry, I&amp;#8217;m being a snob but it didn&amp;#8217;t sound right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Yes, I have Twitter&amp;#8221; I say back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;You should Tweet.&amp;#8221; She says. And I know &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what she means. She wants me to Tweet about how great the event was. So she&amp;#8217;s being assertive and encouraging me to do just that. She&amp;#8217;s being an advertising type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I play dumb on purpose replying &amp;#8220;I DO Tweet&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She looks confused [pause] &amp;#8220;You should Tweet that you liked it&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess she didn&amp;#8217;t realize that if the experience shareworthy, I would share it. It&amp;#8217;s Social Media Week for goodness sakes. Every person in the room had some kind of device in their hand. You don&amp;#8217;t need to ask me to Tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, it&amp;#8217;s kinda like asking someone to make out with you after a date. Either you do or you don&amp;#8217;t. But you don&amp;#8217;t ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say me and my grapes moved on from JWT. I was relieved to find some fresh air on the other side of the door on a cold February day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there you have it. My taste of Social Media Week 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Comedy is Tragedy + Time&#8230;. and Twitter</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/comedy-is-tragedy-time-and-twitter/"/>
   <updated>2011-02-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/comedy-is-tragedy-time-and-twitter</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I did it. Last night I got up on stage and read at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grownupsreadthingstheywroteaskids.com/&quot;&gt;Grownups Read Things they Wrote as Kids&lt;/a&gt;. I read some poetry I wrote in grade nine about a boy, love, drugs, zits&amp;#8211;you name it. Yes, in a narcissistic way, I just want to share it with you because I did something that was a bit outside my comfort zone and I like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I also want to reflect on the question you might be asking yourself &amp;#8220;why (the hell) did I want to read something I wrote in grade 9?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, I want reflect on why the 11 other people who read last night jumped on stage to read stuff. On a bigger scale, I want to consider why Dan Misener&amp;#8217;s project has been so successful that last night was the 10th anniversary of the event.&amp;lt;!--more--&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there&amp;#8217;s a clue to all of this in Dan&amp;#8217;s own description of how the whole thing got started. Apparently he was at his girlfriend&amp;#8217;s house for Christmas when the two stumbled on her old diary. They spent the day reading out loud to one another and discovered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`This is really funny, reading this stuff out loud to each other. I bet other people are in the exact same boat. I bet a lot of other people have this kind of stuff lying around. And wouldn&amp;#8217;t it be fun to get together with a bunch of them and do exactly this?&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was searching for the right stuff to read, I didn&amp;#8217;t think the poems I selected were funny at all. In fact, I thought they were tragic. When I was listening to other people&amp;#8217;s readings, I thought, &amp;#8220;theirs are funny, but mine&amp;#8217;s not funny.&amp;#8221; But, it turns out my poems were funny too.  As you watch the video, pay attention to where the laughter erupts. It&amp;#8217;s worth noting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question around why people like to share stuff like this is not unlike understanding the psychology of using social media platforms like Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some pop-psychology writers like those who are published in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-tao-innovation/200903/understanding-the-psychology-twitter&quot;&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/a&gt; have theorized that it&amp;#8217;s all about our need to connect with community. A community that has become more and more inaccessible since the Industrial Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others like &lt;a href=&quot;http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/the_way_we_live/article5747308.ece&quot;&gt;David Lewis&lt;/a&gt;, a cognitive psychologist in the UK, claim that it&amp;#8217;s all about existentialism:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Using Twitter suggests a level of insecurity whereby, unless people recognize you, you cease to exist. It may stave off insecurity in the short term, but it won&amp;#8217;t cure it.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I reflect on the experience of sharing something awkward and painful, I&amp;#8217;m reminded of some of my more painful Tweets. I can remember the hellish parenting moment I was having when I Tweeted,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;These kids could lead a person to Nicorette.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tragedy of my parenting situation only became funny when I said it out loud&amp;#8211;mostly to strangers out there in the Twitter-verse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At their best, narcissistic Tweets aren&amp;#8217;t much different than reading grade 9 poetry to an audience of grownups. Twitter provides a reflective distance that allows one to step outside of a given moment and therefore have a different reaction to one&amp;#8217;s circumstances. Maybe that&amp;#8217;s one reason why Twitter&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marketingcharts.com/interactive/tech-savvy-moms-increase-social-media-use-by-462-9699/&quot;&gt;so big among the mommy crowd.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, as the queen of comedy Carole Burnett once said, &amp;#8220;Comedy is tragedy plus time.&amp;#8221; To that I would add, &amp;#8220;Comedy is Tragedy plus Twitter.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The essence of Social Media Strategy by Gary Vaynerchuck</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/the-essence-of-social-media-strategy-by-gary-vaynerchuck/"/>
   <updated>2011-01-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/the-essence-of-social-media-strategy-by-gary-vaynerchuck</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a great article in Inc. Magazine, Gary Vaynerchuck, the passionate voice and face of Wine Library TV  lets us in on his day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#8217;s clearly addicted to social media, which is a topic for another discussion, but he drops a strategic nugget that can&amp;#8217;t be overstated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s one of the insights that will help you separate the exploding ranks of folks billing themselves as social media experts just because they spend time on Twitter, Facebook and Foursquare from those who can help you achieve measurable,  sustainable returns that tie back to your business goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people think I&amp;#8217;m a huckster, but with the show, my intent isn&amp;#8217;t to sell our wine. It&amp;#8217;s to educate people about wine. There&amp;#8217;s a big difference. Too many companies think they want to do a video blog to sell merchandise, but if you turn your site into QVC, you lose. I have an audience that trusts me. It&amp;#8217;s about building a global brand—not selling four more bottles of Pinot Grigio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inc.com/magazine/20110201/the-way-i-work-gary-vaynerchuk.html&quot;&gt;The Way I Work: Gary Vaynerchuk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wine Library sells wine by day. At the store. That&amp;#8217;s not what their marketing does. Their marketing helps people learn more about wine. Gary Vaynerchuck is on a mission to make wine more accessible. To unravel the layers of pompous, posturing jargon and to put down the positioning that makes most people uncomfortable buying wine.  Or used to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a win/win/win:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  He gains credibility–a critical asset online, where trust–not cash, is king.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The audiences who enjoy his material get free insight shared by a passionate leader.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The entire wine industry benefits from the buyers Gary is developing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: That&amp;#8217;s what we call Meaningful Marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B: What can you credibly and passionately be helping people take part in?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Just Write It: Sage Advice from Chris Brogan</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/just-write-it-sage-advice-from-chris-brogan/"/>
   <updated>2011-01-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/just-write-it-sage-advice-from-chris-brogan</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I found this from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chrisbrogan.com/the-myth-of-the-perfect-writing-environment/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+chrisbrogandotcom+%28%5Bchrisbrogan.com%5D%29&quot;&gt;Chris Brogan&lt;/a&gt; in my inbox this morning. His newsletter is great. And, if this doesn&amp;#8217;t motivate you to blog more often (or at all) I don&amp;#8217;t know what will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perfect Kills Published&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best sentences don’t sell books (or magazines or whatever). A string of reasonably not bad sentences with useful and engaging information sells books. My books are NOT the best-written books out there on their topic. They’re well-marketed books that I put some soul and heart into. Is every sentence just so? Not even a little bit. But am I a New York Times bestselling author? Oh yes I am. Because I published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the only difference between where a lot of writers are and where I am: I published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How? I write. I write all the time. I’m writing this at Walt Disney World, when I should be riding on the Tower of Terror or something. Yes, I do take time to stop and smell the roses, but I don’t neglect my duties. It’s part of what I do. Write. Get writing. Stop making excuses, and don’t look back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your successful writing future awaits. Just get publishing.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Your Unkempt Assets and Other Lessons</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/you-unkept-assets-and-other-lessons/"/>
   <updated>2011-01-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/you-unkept-assets-and-other-lessons</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4036&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/4033/you-unkept-assets-and-other-lessons/attachment/screen-shot-2011-01-17-at-11-20-17-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4036&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-01-17 at 11.20.17 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-01-17-at-11.20.17-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;511&quot; height=&quot;404&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This morning, with one eye open sipping espresso, I found this in my &amp;#8220;My Daily Deal&amp;#8221; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://livingsocial.com/deals/18358-brazilian-wax?msdc_id=53&amp;amp;ref=TORDeal011711_53_4666email&quot;&gt;Living Social&lt;/a&gt; in my inbox. Living Social is one of the many websites offering &amp;#8220;deeply discounted&amp;#8221; deals at local businesses.  This &amp;#8220;Daily Deal&amp;#8221; was for a discounted Brazilian wax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to ask the women readers if this description of your vaginal area (That&amp;#8217;s right I said vaginal area. And I can say vagina too!) sounds accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Diamonds may be a girl&amp;#8217;s best friend, but when they&amp;#8217;re in the rough they can be prickly to the touch &amp;#8212; just like your unkempt assets. Here&amp;#8217;s a pearl of wisdom: when you snag today&amp;#8217;s edge-smoothing Brazilian wax from La Perla Salon &amp;amp; Spa for $25 (regularly $60), you&amp;#8217;ll be as happy as a clam. Enjoy a complimentary cappuccino or mineral water while you wait for your appointment; then treat your treasure to this stubble-removing service, selecting either hard or soft wax. Located near Eaton Centre, this lux downtown spa and its team of talented technicians will have you cleaned and polished faster than you can compress a karat&amp;#8217;s worth of carbon.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, how many vagina metaphors can there be in one single ad? Apparently my vagina is a diamond. An unkempt asset. A clam. A treasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d like to remind &lt;a href=&quot;http://laperla.sites.toronto.com/&quot;&gt;La Perla Salon and Spa&lt;/a&gt; of the following tenet; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.copyblogger.com/remarkable-marketing-story/&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;Know Your Audience&amp;#8221; is rule #1 &lt;/a&gt;of content creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s try and get inside the mind of a woman who wants a Brazilian wax, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do women who get Brazilian waxes think about their bodies? What is the trigger motivating them to remove all of their pubic hair? For the sake of transparency I&amp;#8217;ll say I&amp;#8217;ve always found the practice to seem rooted in sexism. But that&amp;#8217;s a conversation for another day, and for the purposes of this post, really besides the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is, what does the Brazilian &amp;#8220;do&amp;#8221; for the woman who gets one? Because it must do something in order for her to endure this rather unpleasant process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the following possible options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  It makes her feel &amp;#8216;together&amp;#8217; like a manicure or a haircut. It makes her feel like she&amp;#8217;s on her game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  It makes her feel pretty, sexy, attractive for herself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Same as above for her partner who she aims to please.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  It enhances her sex life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter which insight you think is the right one, in the mind of the &amp;#8216;waxee&amp;#8217; there&amp;#8217;s a pay-off for getting a Brazilian. It makes her feel good and somehow empowered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there is nothing empowering about referring to a woman&amp;#8217;s vagina as a &amp;#8220;diamond in the rough&amp;#8221; or her &amp;#8220;unkempt asset.&amp;#8221; in fact, it makes her body seem like something solely to be consumed by others. Not to mention the fact that if a woman views her vagina as a treasure, it doesn&amp;#8217;t become disgusting the moment it&amp;#8217;s less than hairless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;#8217;s look at a great ad that takes on one of these insights&amp;#8211;that it makes women feel more &amp;#8220;together&amp;#8221; and more attractive to be waxed. The ad avoids being &amp;#8216;judgey&amp;#8217; like the Brazilian copy does&amp;#8211;it says having a neat bikini line is you, but better. And it makes a point of embracing all possible options in the self-grooming category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a peek.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Getting Dominos. Who Has the Last Laugh?</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/getting-dominos-who-gets-the-last-laugh/"/>
   <updated>2011-01-13T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/getting-dominos-who-gets-the-last-laugh</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The film &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foodincmovie.com/&quot;&gt;Food Inc&lt;/a&gt;. opens by dispelling the myth that grocery food comes from the idillic looking farms we often see on their packages. To the sounds of eerie music, a voice over says &amp;#8220;Even though it looks like a tomato, it&amp;#8217;s a &lt;em&gt;notional *tomato. It&amp;#8217;s the *idea&lt;/em&gt; of a tomato.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film is deadly serious about a serious issue. Food Inc.&amp;#8217;s focus is on exposing the secrets that the food industry apparently doesn&amp;#8217;t want us to know&amp;#8211;like the scary places where our food actually comes from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food Inc. and other recent films and books have has been incredibly successful at influencing people&amp;#8217;s thinking about where their food comes from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also seems to be influencing the way marketers are marketing food.&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.1667px;&quot;&gt;Many big food companies are trying to resist being tarred by this brush. And they&amp;#8217;re being pretty creative about it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://express.dominos.ca/&quot;&gt;Dominos pizza&lt;/a&gt; has created an entire campaign called &amp;#8220;Behind the Pizza.&amp;#8221; Here&amp;#8217;s the ad promoting the Behind the Pizza website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get that this is all supposed to be funny and absurd. Not to be a buzz kill, but I&amp;#8217;m going to take the campaign apart to understand how humour functions in the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus group participants are saying they want to know the source of their food, just like films like Food Inc. taught them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people behind Dominoes are initially made to seem highly suspect&amp;#8211; driven around in limos with blacked-out windows like under cover agents. This is scary big food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iconography is over the top. But, it&amp;#8217;s directly addressing a post Food Inc. generation, and telling the folks who worry about food that they&amp;#8217;re simply paranoid. They use traditional folksy images of farms and farmers to make light of people&amp;#8217;s concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.1667px;&quot;&gt;Dominos website &lt;a href=&quot;http://more.dominos.com/behindthepizza/&quot;&gt;Behindthepizza.com&lt;/a&gt; uses the same kind of humour. At the top of each page where they invite you to explore a specific ingredient, the small print says  &amp;#8220;There is not a Dominos actually on the farm.&amp;#8221; Well I guess not&amp;#8230;hardy har har.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4028&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/4021/getting-dominos-who-gets-the-last-laugh/attachment/screen-shot-2011-01-13-at-3-44-38-pm-2&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-4028&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2011-01-13 at 3.44.38 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-01-13-at-3.44.38-PM1-580x412.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;412&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best example happens when you click on&lt;a href=&quot;http://more.dominos.com/behindthepizza/#/spinach/step1&quot;&gt; step 1 of the Spinach icon&lt;/a&gt; to view a video called &lt;em&gt;Baby Spinach: The Most Sensitive Vegetable.&lt;/em&gt; This video talks about &amp;#8220;sensitive&amp;#8221; baby spinach that grows under a rainbow. Babies and rainbows? I think I&amp;#8217;m going to cry. Apparently the spinach cutting machine is tended to by &amp;#8220;warm hearted men and women.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen. I get there&amp;#8217;s a joke going on here. But the question is what kind of joke is it, and what&amp;#8217;s its intended effect?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would argue that while it seems like Dominoes is using irony,  they&amp;#8217;re actually up to something more sinister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironic statements are designed to &amp;#8220;convey a meaning &lt;em&gt;exactly opposite&lt;/em&gt; from their literal meaning.&amp;#8221; Dominoes makes reference to rainbows and babies when talking about their spinach to be funny, but they still want you to associate their food with quality real food, not junk. Put another way, they don&amp;#8217;t want you to think that there&amp;#8217;s a scary industrial dimension to their food. Otherwise, why bother making a site like this at all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flavour of their humour is more like Hyperbole. Unlike irony,  hyperbole is meant to &amp;#8220;to evoke strong feelings or to create a strong impression&amp;#8221; even though it&amp;#8217;s not to be taken literally. So, when you say  &amp;#8220;The bag weighed a ton&amp;#8221; you&amp;#8217;re still trying to convey that the bag is heavy. Just not as heavy as a ton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dominoes is going over the top about their spinach and mushrooms and tomatoes  and the farmers who make them to &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.1667px;&quot;&gt;tell everyone who cares about food to take a deep breath and chill out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the big reason Dominoes uses hyperbole is to make fun of people who worry about farms as factories. They make it seem like what Food Inc. was saying made big food so scary was that they rely on big machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dude, come on. Food Inc. was pointing to foods as factories based on them producing processed &amp;#8220;notional food&amp;#8221; it wasn&amp;#8217;t about farms using big heavy machinery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dominoes is deliberately twisting the idea of factory farming to discredit Food Inc. and other exposés that reveal the dark underbelly of big food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.1667px;&quot;&gt;I feel like I&amp;#8217;m teaching a semiotics class or something. Please pardon me for going all academic on you. But this is what it takes to dissect the layers going on in something as simple as a g-damned pizza campaign. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.1667px;&quot;&gt;This food fight is turning into very serious business. And don&amp;#8217;t kid yourself, the stakes are very high. It&amp;#8217;s important to watch how a film like Food Inc. impacts our culture&amp;#8211;and how those who have the most to lose are fighting hard to maintain the status quo.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Serious Post about an Irreverent Josh Groban</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/a-serious-post-about-an-irreverent-josh-groban/"/>
   <updated>2011-01-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/a-serious-post-about-an-irreverent-josh-groban</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Groban&quot;&gt;Josh Groban&lt;/a&gt; is a tenor vocalist. The folks on his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joshgrobanlive.com/&quot;&gt;fan site&lt;/a&gt; call him a &amp;#8220;classical crossover tenor vocalist.&amp;#8221; In marketing-speak &lt;em&gt;Crossover&lt;/em&gt; is a funny word. I associate it with &amp;#8220;Crossover SUVs&amp;#8221; that are really SUV&amp;#8217;s without the guilt. Is that what&amp;#8217;s going on here? Is Josh Groban just &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Bocelli&quot;&gt;André Bocelli&lt;/a&gt; or worse, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_Divo&quot;&gt;Il Divo&lt;/a&gt;, in hipster clothing? Or does Crossover mean something more?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, when Josh Groban sang &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/kanyewest&quot;&gt;Kayne West tweets&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Kimmel&quot;&gt;Jimmy Kimmel&lt;/a&gt; Live, he changed the game. Well, he&amp;#8217;s been making a name for himself for a while. Remember when he was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlMi5J9RZ38&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;caught&amp;#8221; in line for Snoop Dogg&amp;#8217;s pot brownies &lt;/a&gt;on the AMA&amp;#8217;s? Or when &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwIyLHsk2h4&quot;&gt;he sang the praises of Jimmy F(&amp;amp;king Ben Affleck&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brands were traditionally thought of as having  a consistent set of personality traits. Banks, insurance companies, scotch, Mercedes would all be considered to have &amp;#8220;serious&amp;#8221; brand attributes, and any divergence from this into the realm of silly or irreverent would considered be damaging to the brand. Tenors would also be considered to have &amp;#8220;serious&amp;#8221; brand personalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s interesting to see this old brand thinking to be challenged through Groban&amp;#8217;s antics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of brand personality is changing, and with it the whole notion of who your communities of interest are. Brands, celebrities, businesses are no longer static entities. Imagine if your &amp;#8220;serious&amp;#8221; friend was always serious. Serious at a party. Serious during sex. Serious at the park with his kids. And more and more brands are functioning like people. They are multi-dimensional, and people are cool with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By extension, communities of interest aren&amp;#8217;t static either. So, you might think that only a certain type of person would like a tenor vocalist like Groban. And maybe that person would look like my mom. But, it turns out, that&amp;#8217;s not the whole story. In a recent Billboard magazine interview, Groban said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s easy to generalize,&amp;#8221; he says. &amp;#8220;But I&amp;#8217;d love to take people through my concert audience and point out all the different types of people who are there. I think at the start of my career my audience was older and more female, and that image has stuck around for the rest of the time. But what I think happened is these women brought their husbands and their sons and their daughters, and everybody had a great time, and now it runs the gamut.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the comments about Groban&amp;#8217;s take on Kayne on the notably lewd &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dlisted.com/node/40270&quot;&gt;website D-Listed&lt;/a&gt;, where in addition to the usual disses, people make comments like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josh Groban is so fucking cute. His awesome levels just shot up like 50 more points for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe &amp;#8220;awesome levels&amp;#8221; are the new cred. Being irreverent is one of those things that allows you to seem accessible, funny, interesting&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;human. So you&amp;#8217;re not just &amp;#8220;the amazing voice,&amp;#8221; you&amp;#8217;re the* guy* with the amazing voice. That&amp;#8217;s very different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the cocktail party scenario, there&amp;#8217;s nothing more endearing than when a person surprises you. It happens to me all the time. I know someone as &amp;#8220;edgy&amp;#8221; and they turn out to be really sweet. Or, I think of someone as an intellectual, but I love them so much more when they make me howl with laughter at a party. Consistency is boring. Surprises are memorable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how are you working to surprise people? How would exposing another side of yourself make you more accessible? Or, is accessibility sometimes a bad idea?&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2010-12-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The fantastic people who came to &lt;a href=&quot;http://moustacheparty.eventbrite.com/&quot;&gt;The Great Canadian Moustache Party&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.templekitchen.com/&quot;&gt;Mildred&amp;#8217;s Temple Kitchen&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate Movember, didn&amp;#8217;t just look good, they sounded good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each person had their own bit of wisdom to share about the experience of growing a moustache or watching others grow theirs. And now, we share their wisdom with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did Movember teach you? Check out our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=82D12C176BD7F4D4&quot;&gt;entire Movember playlist&lt;/a&gt; for more wisdom from the evening&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;1. You gotta know who to take home + who to &amp;#8220;kick out in the morning&amp;#8221;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;2. The girl-stache is utterly irresistible&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;3. You gotta go big, or go home&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;4. It&amp;#8217;s all about grooming&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;5. Our dads knew how to do it&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;6. Sometimes you have to suffer to be noble&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;7. For the love of G-d, invest in a decent razor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;8. No one can resist a man with a moustache&lt;/h1&gt;

   <title>How &#8220;Grown Up&#8221; Is Your Brand?</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/how-grown-up-is-your-brand/"/>
   <updated>2010-12-09T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/how-grown-up-is-your-brand</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just turned Forty. To acknowledge the event I wanted my husband to buy me a &amp;#8220;bauble&amp;#8221;&amp;#8211;a keepsake to mark the event. I ended up with a bold choice&amp;#8211;what those in the know might call a  &lt;a href=&quot;http://jewelry01.blogspot.com/2010/08/jewelry-trend-alert-statement-rings.html&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;statement ring&amp;#8221; &lt;/a&gt; from a great Queen Street boutique called&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.loveofmineboutique.com/&quot;&gt; Love of Mine.&lt;/a&gt; I must tell you, I love the ring. I just love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3882&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/3881/how-grown-up-is-your-brand/attachment/screen-shot-2010-12-09-at-12-27-50-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3882&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-12-09 at 12.27.50 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screen-shot-2010-12-09-at-12.27.50-PM-250x250.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not telling you this to brag (it was actually a relatively inexpensive purchase if you must know.) I&amp;#8217;m telling you this because buying this ring made me think about another significant &amp;#8220;bauble&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211;my engagement ring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never* loved* my engagement ring. I think it&amp;#8217;s because when we bought it (8 long years ago), I wasn&amp;#8217;t entirely sure who I was. I diverged from the obvious &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiffany.com/Engagement/Item.aspx?GroupSKU=GRP10001#f+0/0/0/0/0/0&quot;&gt;Tiffany diamond solitaire&lt;/a&gt; kind of ring, but truth be told, the ring I selected in the same general universe of other engagement rings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brands struggle with maturity issues all the time. I am going to go out on a limb and proclaim that you can determine a brand&amp;#8217;s maturity level by considering how confident they are in their individuality and how they feel compelled to express it.&amp;lt;!--more--&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brands that want to be different, but still use convention as a benchmark are what I call &amp;#8220;thinking like a 30 year old.&amp;#8221; As the engagement ring story indicates, at  30 I wanted to be my own woman, but I wasn&amp;#8217;t sure how. As a result, I clung to certain stereotypes about how it was &amp;#8220;supposed to be.&amp;#8221; I may have accessorized conventionality, but I wasn&amp;#8217;t ready to divert from the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I contend that brands that behave like 40 year olds are the ones that have the greatest staying power. Consider Volkswagon&amp;#8217;s&lt;a href=&quot;http://thinkingouttabox.wordpress.com/2009/10/21/volkswagen-ads/&quot;&gt; Think Small &lt;/a&gt;campaign from the 1950&amp;#8242;s.  When everyone else was thinking big Volkswagon was willing to think small.  I would put the original &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.absolut.com/&quot;&gt;Absolut Vodka&lt;/a&gt; ads in this camp&amp;#8211;but I&amp;#8217;d argue that they seem to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/3768/3768&quot;&gt;growing less mature&lt;/a&gt;, not more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a difference between being confident and smart and being audacious just for the sake of being audacious. That type of approach is what I would consider the 20 year old approach&amp;#8211;something very common in beer advertising and more recently in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owGykVbfgUE&quot;&gt;Old Spice Ads&lt;/a&gt; where using sex, irony, etc. is a tactic that gets attention, but to what end?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, the Old Spice ads are like 20 year olds who need to be just a bit too noisy to prove they &amp;#8220;don&amp;#8217;t give a shit?&amp;#8221; Ok, gotcha, you don&amp;#8217;t give a shit. Now please move away, I can&amp;#8217;t hear myself think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the best, recent example of  a 2o year old brand is the Spence Diamonds campaign polluting bus shelters all across the GTA. I&amp;#8217;ll save that rant for another blog post (and it&amp;#8217;s coming up&amp;#8211;I promise you), but needless to say, they make a loud statement, but it&amp;#8217;s one I just don&amp;#8217;t &lt;em&gt;get.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3883&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/3881/how-grown-up-is-your-brand/attachment/screen-shot-2010-12-09-at-1-49-07-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3883&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-12-09 at 1.49.07 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screen-shot-2010-12-09-at-1.49.07-PM-223x250.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;223&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, now that I&amp;#8217;m 40, I feel confident saying that the best brands behave like 40 year olds. Here&amp;#8217;s some examples of  how they do it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  They don&amp;#8217;t need to be LOUD to say something. They can say it quietly&amp;#8211;and still be funny, intelligent, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  They are not original in order to buck tradition, they are original because it&amp;#8217;s in their DNA.  In fact, they&amp;#8217;re not even thinking about tradition. They don&amp;#8217;t need to. They&amp;#8217;re just doing what feels right and it pays dividends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve named a few, but I&amp;#8217;m curious what brands &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; think qualify as  40 year old brands? What&amp;#8217;s a 50, 60, 70 year old brand. I&amp;#8217;d love to hear your opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: Just saw that Sociological Images got ahold of the Spence Diamonds ad and had a few choice words for their approach to single-dom. Check out their blog post here&lt;/em&gt; http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2010/12/09/stigmatizing-single-people/&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Getting to Know Movember</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/getting-to-know-movember-canada/"/>
   <updated>2010-11-30T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/getting-to-know-movember-canada</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3870&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/3869/getting-to-know-movember-canada/attachment/screen-shot-2010-11-30-at-5-06-36-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3870&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-11-30 at 5.06.36 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Screen-shot-2010-11-30-at-5.06.36-PM-250x250.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;You never know where a blog post will lead you. And that&amp;#8217;s part of the fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog post was inspired by a readers comment that raised a question prompting me to do a bit of digging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone calling themselves *No Mo Here *posted the following comment on the W&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/3788/were-getting-behind-movember&quot;&gt;e&amp;#8217;re Getting Behind Movember&lt;/a&gt; blog post. The writer commented:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;Raising funds for Prostate Cancer Canada is positive and Movember is a great idea but, 15% of donations for Movember goes directly into the pocket of the Movember founder. It&amp;#8217;s a little secret that this campaign doesn&amp;#8217;t want you to know. Not all funds goes to fighting Prostate Cancer. Booo.&amp;#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Mo Here *&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;raised an interesting issue. Who exactly &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;is *this mystical organization called&lt;a href=&quot;http://ca.movember.com/&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ca.movember.com/&quot;&gt;Movember Canada&lt;/a&gt;? And how do they make a living? On this, the last day of Movember, I thought I&amp;#8217;d help elucidate and clear the air.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not entirely surprising that someone like &lt;em&gt;No Mo *posted his/her comment. The truth is, I was also confused about who was behind Movember and its relationship to Prostate Cancer in general, and Prostate Cancer Canada in particular. While I&amp;#8217;m a big fan of Movember, I would say that &amp;#8220;Movember the social &lt;/em&gt;movement&amp;#8221;* (men donning &amp;#8216;staches for Prostate Cancer)  is well executed, but &amp;#8220;Movember the &lt;em&gt;organization&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; not well articulated or understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I called Jesse Hayman, Campaign Coordinator for Movember Canada to get a better understanding of these Movember folks, and here&amp;#8217;s what I found out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; *&lt;em&gt;Movember is non-profit: *&lt;/em&gt;In Canada, Movember is a non profit organization but they don&amp;#8217;t have charitable status. That means they can raise money but they can&amp;#8217;t issue tax receipts. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prostatecancer.ca/&quot;&gt;Prostate Cancer Canada&lt;/a&gt; issues tax receipts on their behalf. As a non profit, they each make salaries, but no money is going into anyone&amp;#8217;s pocket&amp;#8211;not even the founder&amp;#8217;s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; *&lt;em&gt;They&amp;#8217;re friendly: *&lt;/em&gt;Movember Canada&amp;#8217;s offices are within Prostate Cancer Canada&amp;#8217;s offices. They are separate organizations, but they sit together, and play nicely together. They are friends. Aw.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; *&lt;em&gt;They&amp;#8217;re in the awareness business: *&lt;/em&gt;Movember is a public education engine. They deliver awareness and generate funds. They don&amp;#8217;t deliver services to folks dealing with Prostate Cancer. That&amp;#8217;s Prostate Cancer Canada&amp;#8217;s job. And PCC does a very good job of delivering services  through research, support, education and more. That&amp;#8217;s why Movember Canada directs all funds to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;They&amp;#8217;re a lean, mean awareness machine.&lt;/strong&gt; They employ 3 staff full time in Canada. The rest of the work and outreach is done by volunteers across the country&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; *&lt;em&gt;They have costs: *&lt;/em&gt;The 15% raised by Movember Canada does not go into the founder&amp;#8217;s pocket. Rather 15% of the money raised through Movember goes to pay for staff, infrastructure, materials, etc. to run a rockingly good organization moving the needle on a crucial health issue. According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&amp;amp;cpid=48&quot;&gt;Charity Navigator&lt;/a&gt;, organizations that spend 33.3% or less on expenses to raise money are doing their jobs just fine, thank you. Movember Canada is well within this range. But, they say they&amp;#8217;re always trying to lower their administrative costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;They do alot of good:&lt;/strong&gt; Last year Movember Canada raised $7.8 million for Prostate Cancer. This year, they&amp;#8217;re headed toward the $20 million dollar mark. I&amp;#8217;d say that&amp;#8217;s pretty super-fantastic. If you ran a business that grossed $20 million on netted $17 million, you&amp;#8217;d feel pretty darned good about yourself. Let&amp;#8217;s give Movember Canada a round of applause puhlease!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; *&lt;em&gt;They could do better: *&lt;/em&gt;Movember Canada and Movember in general could do a better job of positioning themselves within this very important movement. That would help others trust their motivations and understand their strong connection to the issue of Prostate Cancer, and Prostate Cancer Canada. If that helps people part with their money than all the better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you go *No Mo Here, *maybe now that I&amp;#8217;ve cleared things up you can rename yourself *Grow Mo Here *when Movember rolls around again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy last day of Movember everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2010-11-29T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/3857</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just started reading a fascinating book called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Emperor-All-Maladies-Biography-Cancer/dp/1439107955&quot;&gt;The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer &lt;/a&gt;that traces the history of the elusive disease and its treatments. In it, the author Sidhartha Mukherjee talks about dramatic medical  developments that lead to current cancer treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mukherjee claims that the widepread purchaing of &amp;#8220;durables&amp;#8221; from the 1920&amp;#8242;s onward coincided with a rapid increase in the number and kind of drugs that dramatically lengthened people&amp;#8217;s lifespan and their sense of immortality. It&amp;#8217;s hard to believe, but life expectancy for Americans rose from fourty-seven to sixty-eight in the first half of the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;A young generation thus dreamed of cures&amp;#8211;of a death free, disease free existence. Lullued by the idea of the durability of life, they threw themselves into consuming durables&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, people bought &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studebaker&quot;&gt;Studebakers&lt;/a&gt; and TV&amp;#8217;s because they suddenly felt like they were going to live forever&amp;#8211;or at least for a long, long time. So they invested stuff that would be around too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3859&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/3857/3857/attachment/screen-shot-2010-11-29-at-11-06-41-am&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3859&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-11-29 at 11.06.41 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Screen-shot-2010-11-29-at-11.06.41-AM-250x250.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does it say about our current state of mind that we live in a disposable culture? Whenever I find myself in a &amp;#8216;big box&amp;#8217; store, I&amp;#8217;m stunned by the sheer quantity of junk people are willing to pay hard earned money for. Of course that effect is amplified during holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, my friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fashiontakesaction.com/content/about/founder/72-founder-a-president-kelly-drennan&quot;&gt;Kelly Drennan&lt;/a&gt;, founder of Fashion Takes Action posted &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestar.com/living/article/874727--fast-fashion-pricing-hits-new-lows&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; on her Facebook page that that talks about how cheap fashionable clothes are these days. Cheapness in the price of clothes is of course accompanied by low quality. But no one seems to mind. The article quotes one woman&amp;#8217;s reaction to her cheap summer dresses falling apart after only one season of wear:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Usually for those kinds of things I don&amp;#8217;t even consider really whether or not I&amp;#8217;ll have them around for next summer,” she says. “If I do, great. If not, because they were so cheap it almost doesn&amp;#8217;t really matter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it a coincidence that our culture of consumption is accompanied by a health crisis? Diabetes, cancer, obesity, etc. are all on the rise and we&amp;#8217;re buying more and more disposable crap. Is our sense of mortality causing us to become a more disposable culture?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We deliberately turn a blind eye to the fact that all this stuff is literally killing us and the planet&amp;#8211;so perhaps it&amp;#8217;s a vicious cycle. More stuff=bad health=more stuff. And on and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.storyofstuff.com/&quot;&gt;The Story of Stuff&lt;/a&gt; for a quick Coles Notes version of how the materials economy works:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I came across an article called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livingprinciples.org/new-relationships-with-our-stuff/&quot;&gt;New Relationships with our Stuff&lt;/a&gt; that posits a new movement is afoot. Websites like &lt;a href=&quot;http://neighborgoods.net/&quot;&gt;Neighbourgoods &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href=&quot;http://snapgoods.com/&quot;&gt;Snapgoods &lt;/a&gt;allow people to borrow, rent and sell  things they they already have rather than getting them new from a store. The local, artisinal and craft movements are also evidence of this shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does it mean we&amp;#8217;re feeling more immortal? Is this an effort to get back to a time when things were more solid and predictable rather than temporal and fleeting? Are we seeking better health? Better lives? Less stuff?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a conference in San Fransisco in January where these issues will be the central focus of discussion. It&amp;#8217;s called &lt;a href=&quot;http://compostmodern.org/&quot;&gt;Compostmodern&lt;/a&gt;, and I&amp;#8217;m thinking about checking it out. Anyone want to come?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3850&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/3846/ba-de-ya-dancing-in-movember/attachment/hypenotic_movember_badge-5&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3850&quot; title=&quot;Hypenotic_movember_badge&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Hypenotic_movember_badge4-250x250.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We came. We saw. We &amp;#8216;stached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://moustacheparty.eventbrite.com/&quot;&gt;Great Canadian Moustache Party&lt;/a&gt; was the result of good old fashioned team work; Hypenotic brought design + social media chops, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.templekitchen.com/&quot;&gt;Mildred&amp;#8217;s Temple Kitchen&lt;/a&gt; brought incredible food, atmosphere and service, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thebaitshop.ca/&quot;&gt;The Baitshop&lt;/a&gt; brought their styles, creativity and skills in hand screening shirts and designing decks. And no one slacked. Thanks Team!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there were friends like &lt;a href=&quot;http://mixedsignals.ca/#/-in-the-house-canada&quot;&gt;Andy Roberts&lt;/a&gt; who played great tunes and &lt;a href=&quot;http://tarazatstudios.com/&quot;&gt;Aaron Phaelan &lt;/a&gt;who came out to shoot some video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course it wouldn&amp;#8217;t have happened without the friends who came to support the cause. Thanks for being there and bringing the kind of enthusiasm that makes us love you. We have a couple more Movember surprises. And, stay tuned, next year&amp;#8217;s planning is already in the works.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Calling Out Around the World</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/calling-out-around-the-world/"/>
   <updated>2010-11-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/calling-out-around-the-world</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve been planning and calling and working, and calling. All in support of &lt;a href=&quot;http://ca.movember.com/&quot;&gt;Movember&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prostatecancer.ca/&quot;&gt;Prostate Cancer Canada.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#8217;t generally go for the celebrity endorsement thing. It&amp;#8217;s against our genetic makeup. But somehow, the idea of getting Burton Cummings, Lanny MacDonald or Alex Trebek in the room (sadly Louis Riel, Doug Henning and Bruno Gerussi are no longer with us) was irresistible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#8217;ve been seeing what I can do to send our Great Canadian Moustache Party over the top. It all takes place Movember 24th at Mildred&amp;#8217;s Temple Kitchen. &lt;a href=&quot;http://moustacheparty.eventbrite.com/&quot;&gt;Get your tickets here &lt;/a&gt;because capacity is limited. You never know who may show up!&lt;/p&gt;

They sum it up best when they call themselves &amp;#8220;a multi-faceted place of business and leisure.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baitshop co-owners Ken and Greg jumped on the opportunity to join forces with Hypenotic and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.templekitchen.com/&quot;&gt;Mildred&amp;#8217;s Temple Kitchen&lt;/a&gt; to throw and awesome Movember party in support of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prostatecancer.ca/&quot;&gt;Prostate Cancer Canada. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this video, The Baitshop boys talk about why they&amp;#8217;re getting behind Movember and celebrating The Great Canadian Moustache at Mildred&amp;#8217;s Temple Kitchen. They&amp;#8217;ll be at the party displaying artworks featuring our favourite Moustached Canadians and screening t-shirts with the images on site&amp;#8211;all available to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you bought your tickets yet? They&amp;#8217;re only $25 and there&amp;#8217;s limited capacity, so&lt;a href=&quot;http://moustacheparty.eventbrite.com/&quot;&gt; buy your tickets NOW.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>We&#8217;re Getting Behind Movember</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-3804&quot; title=&quot;MovemberBadge_SJFB_small&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/MovemberBadge_SJFB_small.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; /&gt;November is one of those months that jumps on you when you&amp;#8217;re not looking. It&amp;#8217;s September&amp;#8230;.and then &lt;em&gt;bam&lt;/em&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s November. That&amp;#8217;s why it&amp;#8217;s taken us so long to get on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ca.movember.com/&quot;&gt;Movember&lt;/a&gt; train. We meant to do it last year, and the year before. But now we really are. In true Hypenotic fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Barry says on his &lt;a href=&quot;http://ca.movember.com/mospace/992220/&quot;&gt;Movember profile page&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Never doubt that a small cluster of facial hair can change the world&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, we&amp;#8217;ve arrived. And, just to let you know Hypenotic has gotten behind (yes, pun intended) Movember for several reasons;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Because its a bit ridiculous, and so are we&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Because we&amp;#8217;re a values based company, so what better way to demonstrate our values than to wear them on our faces?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Because we can, and will, make a whole lot of noise around this moustache business and help people better understand Prostate Cancer, and the organization Movember supports, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prostatecancer.ca/&quot;&gt;Prostate Cancer Canada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Because we can help raise money for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prostatecancer.ca/&quot;&gt;Prostate Cancer Canada&lt;/a&gt; who is committed to &amp;#8220;elimination of the disease through research, education support and awareness.&amp;#8221; Sounds good to us. Especially when 1 in 6 of all men will get it in their lifetime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stubbly faced fellas around Hypenotic had a few words to say about Movember, so let&amp;#8217;s turn it over to Barry, Rick and Lionel.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Absolut Branding: City Inspired Vodka is (Mostly) Smart Marketing</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/3768/"/>
   <updated>2010-11-09T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/3768</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3770&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/3768/3768/attachment/screen-shot-2010-11-09-at-11-11-49-am&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-3770&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-11-09 at 11.11.49 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Screen-shot-2010-11-09-at-11.11.49-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;317&quot; height=&quot;244&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.absolut.com/&quot;&gt;Absolut Vodka&lt;/a&gt; has released its infamous spirit in a number of city-inspired flavours. New Orleans vodka tastes like mango and black pepper, LA tastes like blueberry, acai berry, acerola cherry and pomegranate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a smart move for Absolut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every vodka brand has mimicked the flavours that Absolut was initially known for. So now &lt;a href=&quot;http:www.greygoose.com&quot;&gt;Grey Goose&lt;/a&gt; comes in L&amp;#8217;Orange, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smirnoff.com&quot;&gt;Smirnoff&lt;/a&gt; Blueberry tastes, you guessed it, like Blueberry and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you&amp;#8217;re a connoisseur, Vodka is a parity product, and brands are looking for ways to stand apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his book &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zagbook.com/&quot;&gt;Zag&lt;/a&gt;, Marty Neumeier focuses on outlining a strategy to ensure your brand is *not *doing what the other guy is doing.  This is because, in Neumeier&amp;#8217;s words&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fighting clutter with more clutter is like trying to put out a fire with gasoline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to zagging, according to Neumeier is looking for new market space, or &amp;#8220;white space&amp;#8221; that you brand can claim, and credibly own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Absolute zagged, and they did it right by leveraging the power of meaningful marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/branding/2189/2189&quot;&gt;previous blog post, I criticized Febreeze &lt;/a&gt;for coming up with air fresheners that were supposed to smell like places like &amp;#8220;Moroccan Bazzar.&amp;#8221; But Absolut has approached the &amp;#8216;places&amp;#8217; idea in a far more intelligent way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each city themed vodka has a portion of proceeds going to a worthy cause that is directly embedded within the city featured on the bottle. So, the New Orleans vodka has proceeds directed at Hurricane Katrina relief, and the Brooklyn vodka supports Habitat for Humanity to help fund an affordable homes project in Bedford-Stuyvesant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to note that there is some controversy surrounding Absolut Brooklyn that threatens its intrinsic values- proposition. Director &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000490/&quot;&gt;Spike Lee&lt;/a&gt;, collaborated with Absolut on the creative execution of the bottle and ad. The video celebrating Brooklyn&amp;#8217;s stoops is undeniably hip and fun&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one big problem; the Brooklyn Neighbourhood featured in the video, ads and on the bottle has a number of social issues, one of which includes alcoholism. And, in  troubled neighbourhood where people are inundated with alcohol advertising, the Absolut Brooklyn ads are the most prominent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[The New York Daily News ][7]featured a number of teenagers who did a survey of alcohol advertising posters and billboards in their neighbourhood and they had some choice words for Spike Lee. When asked what he&amp;#8217;d like to tell Spike Lee, one teenager commented:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;d be like, &amp;#8216;Why? Do you understand what you&amp;#8217;re doing &amp;#8230; that you&amp;#8217;re putting up an ad for liquor and you know there&amp;#8217;s an alcoholism problem here?&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This controversy brings the challenges of values-based marketing into sharp relief. The moment you try to claim any kind of values space, you&amp;#8217;re suddenly vulnerable to criticism. I&amp;#8217;ve used this example before but it&amp;#8217;s a good one; claim you&amp;#8217;re a vegetarian and suddenly everyone&amp;#8217;s checking out your belt and footwear to call you out on your hypocricy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a director committed to films profiling African Americans, Spike Lee&amp;#8217;s involvement raises the &amp;#8220;values&amp;#8221; bar. The criticism of young people from Bedford-Stuyvesant probably should have been anticipated by the agency behind Absolut. But something tells me it likely didn&amp;#8217;t cross their minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, should Absolut have stayed out of the controversy and veered to a different city? Or, is this a suitable homage to Brooklyn? Are people overreacting? After all, is Brooklyn really the market for Absolut Brooklyn, or is it the rest of us who romanticize about the stoop life that Lee portrays?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curious what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[7]: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;d be like, &amp;#39;Why? Do you understand what you&amp;#39;re doing ... that you&amp;#39;re putting up an ad for liquor and you know there&amp;#39;s an alcoholism problem here?&amp;#39;&amp;quot; he said.

   <title>A Visual Rendering of the Term Artisanal</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/i-know-it-when-i-see-it-a-visual-rendering-of-the-term-artisanal/"/>
   <updated>2010-10-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/i-know-it-when-i-see-it-a-visual-rendering-of-the-term-artisanal</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grist.org/article/food-2010-10-27-an-artisanal-plea-from-a-fed-up-foodie&quot;&gt;a great rant on the term &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grist.org/article/food-2010-10-27-an-artisanal-plea-from-a-fed-up-foodie&quot;&gt;Artisanal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grist.org/article/food-2010-10-27-an-artisanal-plea-from-a-fed-up-foodie&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;was posted by the food editor of my new favourite blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grist.org/&quot;&gt;Grist&lt;/a&gt;.  Here are a few choice words &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grist.org/member/1411&quot;&gt;Bonnie Azab Powell&lt;/a&gt; had about food products claiming to be &amp;#8220;artisanal&amp;#8221;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artisanal once described something meaningful, honoring the labor of people who make things very skillfully, with their hands. By now, it&amp;#8217;s just an emptied-out, hollow marketing term, like &amp;#8220;fresh.&amp;#8221; And things have gotten absurd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s true. Terms like &amp;#8220;organic,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;sustainable,&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;artisanal&amp;#8221; have been so abused by food companies that they&amp;#8217;re now virtually meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then again, sometimes language adds a layer of complexity that gets in the way of our own basic &amp;#8220;I know it when I see it&amp;#8221; intuition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.1667px;&quot;&gt;They say a picture&amp;#8217;s worth a 1000 words. So while everyone&amp;#8217;s busy writing up Manifestos on the meaning of artisanal,  I thought it&amp;#8217;d be best to show some images of Dawn Woodward from &lt;a href=&quot;http://evelynscrackers.com/&quot;&gt;Evelyn&amp;#8217;s Crackers&lt;/a&gt; that demonstrate her dedication to her craft. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dawn and Ed describe their crackers as &amp;#8220;handcrafted from artisanal, organic ingredients.&amp;#8221; No matter how you define artisanal, their crackers fit the bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I know? Have a look at some photos I snapped at our meeting this morning. These are most definitely living examples of the &amp;#8220;I know it when I see it&amp;#8221; methodology at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3736 aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;dawn&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/dawn.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.1667px;&quot;&gt;These are a true baker&amp;#8217;s arms. Notice the burn marks? Someone once asked Dawn if she was a cutter. But these kinds of burns are par for the course when you bake your own crackers. Owners of big cracker factories don&amp;#8217;t typically get these. Know what I&amp;#8217;m saying?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3737&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/3735/i-know-it-when-i-see-it-a-visual-rendering-of-the-term-artisanal/attachment/dawn3&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3737 aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;dawn3&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/dawn3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.1667px;&quot;&gt;Dawn is extremely dedicated to her craft. How dedicated you ask? Well, dedicated enough to have wheat, that&amp;#8217;s right, wheat tattooed on her back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3740&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/3735/i-know-it-when-i-see-it-a-visual-rendering-of-the-term-artisanal/attachment/photo-7&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3740 aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;photo-7&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/photo-7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one serendipitous moment at the end of our meeting with Dawn and Ed, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kraftcanada.com/en/Products/P-R/RITZCrackers.aspx&quot;&gt;Ritz &lt;/a&gt;cracker truck went speeding by. We caught Dawn standing in the foreground with the Ritz truck behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ve heard of Ritz, that little cracker company owned by&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kraftcanada.com/en/home.aspx&quot;&gt; Kraft&lt;/a&gt;? I think it&amp;#8217;d be safe to say their crackers aren&amp;#8217;t artisanal in any sense of the word. How can you tell? Just check out the size of their truck. It&amp;#8217;s a dead giveaway.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Nestle Funds Research to Further Confuse Parents</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/gerber-and-nestle-release-research-to-further-confuse-parents/"/>
   <updated>2010-10-25T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/gerber-and-nestle-release-research-to-further-confuse-parents</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3717&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/3716/gerber-and-nestle-release-research-to-further-confuse-parents/attachment/screen-shot-2010-10-25-at-3-34-56-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-3717&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-10-25 at 3.34.56 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-25-at-3.34.56-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;343&quot; height=&quot;203&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Nestlé put out a research report called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foodpolitics.com/2010/10/toddler-eating-patterns-the-latest-survey/&quot;&gt;Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study &lt;/a&gt;(FITS).  The study generally concludes that infant nutrition is improving, but Toddlers are not well fed. Before turning to the study&amp;#8217;s findings, let us consider why Nestlé would fund and publish this particular piece of research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a little factoid you might not know. Nestlé acquired &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gerber.com/Public/Default.aspx&quot;&gt;Gerber &lt;/a&gt;in 2007. Hmmm&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gerber has always been big in the baby food world. But like all good food companies, Gerber needs to grow and be profitable. There are only so many babies born each year.  They need more &amp;amp; newer revenue streams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.4px;&quot;&gt;Can you just imagine  Nestlé execs sitting around contemplating &amp;#8220;H&lt;em&gt;ow can we extend Gerber&amp;#8217;s ubiquity beyond infancy&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;#8221; &amp;#8221; OH!  OH! OH! I know.&amp;#8221; says one astute young brand executive  &amp;#8220;Let&amp;#8217;s make toddler foods and market them to parents&amp;#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.4px;&quot;&gt;One problem. Toddlers don&amp;#8217;t need pre-made food. They can just eat regular &amp;#8220;people&amp;#8221; food. Or can they?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.4px;&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the idea. Gerber convinces parents that they need Gerber to guide their choices around &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.4px;&quot;&gt;food because nowadays food  is too complicated an issue for parents to be able to understand let alone &lt;em&gt;manage&lt;/em&gt; on their own.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.4px;&quot;&gt;While folks like &lt;a href=&quot;http://michaelpollan.com/books/food-rules/&quot;&gt;Michael Pollan&lt;/a&gt; are trying to keep it simple (&amp;#8220;Eat real food. Not too much. Mostly plants&amp;#8221;) Nestlé is trying to keep things complicated. Real complicated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, Gerber now makes Toddler foods like this clever &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gerber.com/Toddler/Products/PASTA_PICK_UPS.aspx?PLineId=7510b910-e601-4a5c-97b2-331b4ce33e5b&amp;amp;PCatId=9772c526-b81c-45a2-80c7-dd7893122bea&amp;amp;PMilestoneId=98fef2e2-431f-4082-a5f2-0f17226b14b7&quot;&gt;microwavable ravioli&lt;/a&gt;, just the right size for toddler&amp;#8217;s hands. They&amp;#8217;ve even segued into pre-schooler foods like the super duper nutritious &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gerber.com/Preschooler/Products/Preschooler_Juice_Treats.aspx&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;juice treats.&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; All with the right amount of fat, calories, sodium. It&amp;#8217;s like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.leancuisine.com/Index/Index.aspx&quot;&gt;Lean Cuisine &lt;/a&gt;(also owned by Nestlé) for kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re not convinced that Nestlé/Gerber are hell bent on making food seem utterly complicated, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gerber.com/Public/Default.aspx&quot;&gt;Gerber website&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently sitters, crawlers and walkers all have different nutritional needs. Check out this handy dandy &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gerber.com/Toddler/Nutrition_And_Feeding/shsh_nutrition_101.aspx&quot;&gt;nutrition glossary&lt;/a&gt;. That thing has more information about food than any parent would ever want to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.4px;&quot;&gt;Ok. so back to the research findings of the FIT study. Here&amp;#8217;s some of what we learned:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.4px;&quot;&gt;71% of toddlers and 84% of preschoolers consume more sodium than recommended on a given day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  25% of older infants, toddlers and preschoolers do not eat even one serving of fruit on a given day, and 30% do not eat a single serving of vegetables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  A small but important number of older infants are not getting enough iron. Twelve percent of children from six-to-11 months of age are not getting enough iron on a given day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  French fries are still the most popular vegetable among toddlers and preschoolers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#8217;s the solution? Clearly to feed your kids (a.k.a &amp;#8220;The Gerber Generation&amp;#8221;) more of the &amp;#8220;patent pending&amp;#8221; scientifically rendered microwavable food in the plastic container. Clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think this makes any sense my friends, I&amp;#8217;d like to enrol you in a research study of my own, also coincidentally called the FITS study (an acronym for Food Is The Shit) researching why parents can&amp;#8217;t figure out what to feed their kids to raise them healthy. Come on people. Anyone heard of carrots?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, for your amusement, a little Gerber ad featuring the many faces of &amp;#8220;Gerber generation&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.4px;&quot;&gt;is all about kids up to 5 years of age:&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 17.28px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Silly Bandz: They&#8217;re not just for Dupes, Are They?</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/silly-bandz-theyre-not-just-for-dupes/"/>
   <updated>2010-10-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/silly-bandz-theyre-not-just-for-dupes</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3707&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/3703/silly-bandz-theyre-not-just-for-dupes/attachment/screen-shot-2010-10-21-at-11-47-44-am&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-3707&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-10-21 at 11.47.44 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-21-at-11.47.44-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;284&quot; height=&quot;183&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve never seen a trend move so fast. It was like watching a virtual trend-nami released into the elementary school playground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.4px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Week 1:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sillybandz.com/&quot;&gt;Silly Bandz&lt;/a&gt; first spotted on a 6 year old kid who was over for a playdate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Week 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Daughters received Silly Bandz (or some variant) as a lootbag at a birthday party&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Week 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Silly Bandz confiscated by supply teacher at school for being too &amp;#8220;distracting&amp;#8221; and parents randomly walking up to me, asking me where to get them &amp;#8217;cause there kid is humiliated by having none.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the surface, today&amp;#8217;s Silly Bandz aren&amp;#8217;t much different that the black rubber bracelets we almost-40 year olds wore in the 80&amp;#8242;s. And, many would think that they&amp;#8217;re a sign that young people can&amp;#8217;t think for themselves but are instead inclined to do whatever their pals are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3706&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/3703/silly-bandz-theyre-not-just-for-dupes/attachment/screen-shot-2010-10-21-at-11-04-03-am&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-3706&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-10-21 at 11.04.03 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-21-at-11.04.03-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;267&quot; height=&quot;401&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But, here&amp;#8217;s the twist. We didn&amp;#8217;t have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com&quot;&gt;YouTube &lt;/a&gt;in the 80&amp;#8242;s. So, we wore the rubber bracelets pretty much like Madge did&amp;#8211;up and down the arm. And we were quiet about it. &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.4px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;We &lt;/em&gt;didn&amp;#8217;t rock the boat. &lt;em&gt;We&lt;/em&gt; didn&amp;#8217;t write songs about black rubber bracelets, and &lt;em&gt;we &lt;/em&gt;didn&amp;#8217;t make movies about &amp;#8216;em either. We simply wore them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.4px;&quot;&gt;The world has changed since those black rubber bracelets were the most sought after school yard accessory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.4px;&quot;&gt;Here are some interesting videos that feature young girls &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8216;owning&amp;#8217; &lt;/em&gt;their Silly Bandz. All of these riveting productions show these girls adapting their Silly Bandz in ways that put their creativity, fashion sense and ingenuity to work. They provide an interesting case study on the power of YouTube in the hands of some PYT&amp;#8217;s (That&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdV7Kb1RG8Y&quot;&gt;Pretty Young Things&lt;/a&gt; for those who were around when Michael Jackson was still normal)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, a tutorial from webkinzhipporocks on how to make Silly Bandz into earrings. Listen to how she says the word &amp;#8220;Silly Bandz.&amp;#8221; Pretty funny at the end when she tries to explain what to do with the earrings if you don&amp;#8217;t have pierced ears.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A DIY project where powdrpunkgrrl demonstrates how to fix a Silly Bandz by sewing with some pretty rockin&amp;#8217; tunes in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, here&amp;#8217;s prettycat2000 demonstrating a cool Silly Bandz trick&amp;#8211;turning a Silly Bandz into an Air Balloon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.4px;&quot;&gt;So, what do you think? Is this just fetishization of brand paraphanalia, or true creativity at work?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Who Knew The Pre-Show Would be so Interesting?</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/who-knew-the-pre-show-would-be-so-interesting/"/>
   <updated>2010-10-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/who-knew-the-pre-show-would-be-so-interesting</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My buddy Joshna and I decided to watch a movie. Well, to be more specific, we decided to watch&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067093/&quot;&gt; Fiddler on the Roof&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8211;a movie that strangely (being a Jewish girl) I had never seen before and Joshna had strangely (being an Indian/South African girl) had watched endlessly as a child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set the date and the build-up began. It started with Twitter references, but by the time the event rolled around it had become epic including a trip to &lt;a href=&quot;http://toronto.ibegin.com/retail/queen-video&quot;&gt;Queen Video&lt;/a&gt; for the movie rental,  &lt;a href=&quot;http://caplanskys.com/&quot;&gt;Caplanskys&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216; smoked meat sandwiches and fabulous &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.manischewitz.com/&quot;&gt;Manischewitz&lt;/a&gt; cocktails. Maybe that doesn&amp;#8217;t sound epic to you, but you might feel differently after you&amp;#8217;ve seen the (slap-dash) video about what happened before the Fiddler fiddled his first note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This video shows how much &amp;#8220;content&amp;#8221; exists before the main event even takes place. By having a camera in hand and doing a couple of context shots, I can give folks a pretty good sense of where the evening is headed. You can do the same for your videos&amp;#8211;which will inevitably be less exciting than the night Jodi + Joshna watched Fiddler on the Roof, but nothing can be done about that, can it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some ideas for shooting a pre-event video:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Give context: *&lt;/em&gt;Joshna walking through the doorway, the Caplanskys sign&amp;#8211;these all tell you where you are in the video. If you don&amp;#8217;t have that footage you can always use transition slides (Slides that say &amp;#8220;Then we went to get some deli&amp;#8221; but it&amp;#8217;s not quite as fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Decide what is worthy of &amp;#8216;build up&amp;#8217; and what will be of interest to your audience. *&lt;/em&gt;Is it the dress rehearsal? The pre-game talk? The dressing of the room?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Plan but don&amp;#8217;t over-plan. *&lt;/em&gt;I couldn&amp;#8217;t have known that the girl at the video store would be so cute and forthcoming had I not been intrepid enough to ask her a few key questions. Turns out she was awesome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Keep it short. *&lt;/em&gt;People have short attention spans. Stuff can be interesting, but only for so long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Jazz it up.&lt;/strong&gt; Music is key to keeping people&amp;#8217;s attention. It can add romance to a non-event like buying some deli&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Interview everyone. *&lt;/em&gt;Some of the answers you get will be worth keeping, others won&amp;#8217;t. But, keep asking and talking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>The Blessing of a Lost Makeup Bag</title>

   <updated>2010-10-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/the-blessing-of-a-lost-makeup-bag</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3569&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/3567/the-blessing-of-a-lost-makeup-bag/attachment/screen-shot-2010-10-16-at-8-55-58-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-3569&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-10-16 at 8.55.58 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-16-at-8.55.58-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;316&quot; height=&quot;325&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It was the perfect storm. First the fixture in our bathroom broke and we were down to one bulb making it hard to see my skin up close. Then, I lost my makeup bag&amp;#8211;just one of the hazards of lugging it back and forth from my spinning class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I went a week without makeup or hair product. I apologize if you were one of the people who saw me during that week-long period. I wasn&amp;#8217;t looking my best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truth is I couldn&amp;#8217;t live without my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kynk.ca/product/HH110&quot;&gt;Kynk  Hair Honey&lt;/a&gt;, a fabulous all natural product that doesn&amp;#8217;t irritate my already super sensitive scalp with alcohol. I&amp;#8217;ve only ever seen Hair Honey at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thebigcarrot.ca/&quot;&gt;The Big Carrot&lt;/a&gt;, so off I went to replace it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And,  while at The Big Carrot, with my hubby and kids waiting in the car, I made the monumental, spontaneous decision to shift to all chemical free cosmetics. In addition to the Hair Honey, I  bought two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.earthlab.ca/products/natural_mascara.html&quot;&gt;Earthlab Cosmetics Raw Mascara &lt;/a&gt;and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.100percentpure.com/PINK-GRAPEFRUIT-GLOW-LIP-CHEEK-TINT-s/70.htm&quot;&gt;100 Percent Pure Pink Grapefruit Glow for Lips and Cheeks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m now determined to whittle my formerly overstuffed makeup bag down to 5 items max (blush, mascara, lipstick, tinted moisturizer and eyeliner).  And, I want all of those things to be friendly to my body and to the earth. As the saying goes &amp;#8220;what goes on goes in&amp;#8221; and I want what goes in to not mess with my health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a radical step for me. The last remaining &amp;#8220;conventional&amp;#8221; makeup item in my possession is my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dermalogica.com/ca/html/products/sheer-moisture-spf15-18.html?type=&amp;amp;cat=&quot;&gt;Dermalogica Sheer Tint Moisture&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8211;salvaged by the fact that it had fallen out of my makeup bag before I schlepped it to the gym that fateful day. A little peak at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cosmeticsdatabase.com/&quot;&gt;The Environmental Working Group&amp;#8217;s Skin Deep database &lt;/a&gt;revealed that my trusted Moisturizer is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cosmeticsdatabase.com/product/278663/Dermalogica_Sheer_Tint_Moisture_SPF_15_Dark/&quot;&gt;rated a 3 out of 10&lt;/a&gt; on their hazard scale&amp;#8211;a moderate hazard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moderate hazard? Is it worth the risk?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up with a mom who had a vanity table with a big mirror with lights all around it. I felt totally glamorous looking in that mirror. I think I probably spent hours staring at my reflection.  And the drawers of that Hollywood vanity table were full of neatly organized fancy makeup containers that were incredibly alluring to me&amp;#8211;even at an early age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My &amp;#8216;bubby&amp;#8217; (Jewish grandmother) was proud to declare that she never left home without her makeup. I&amp;#8217;ve always kinda been the same. People don&amp;#8217;t think of me as the &amp;#8220;makeup type&amp;#8221; because the makeup itself is barely detectable on my face. It&amp;#8217;s more the gesture, the idea of makeup I guess that makes me feel &amp;#8220;put together.&amp;#8221;&lt;br&gt;
But, I promise, I&amp;#8217;m always wearing mascara and tinted moisturizer if not more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is until I lost my makeup bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, giving  up conventional makeup isn&amp;#8217;t easy for me. There&amp;#8217;s quite a bit of marketing baggage that has helped convince me that the familiar store-bought makeup is fun and makes me look pretty. In fact, when I got into the car today and unwrapped my new cheek and lip glow, eager to try it on for size, my husband (with whom I have 2 daughters) said &amp;#8220;Just like one of the girls.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he was right. But this time there was a difference. I finally decided to infuse my enjoyment of cosmetics with my own personal values. I&amp;#8217;m venturing to say that it won&amp;#8217;t  make me enjoy it less, or feel less pampered, pretty, etc. In fact, I&amp;#8217;m already looking forward to my next trip to The Big Carrot for some tinted moisturizer and an eyeliner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you see me around, tell me what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Malcolm Gladwell bulls-eyes wrong target</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/malcolm-gladwell-bulls-eyes-wrong-target/"/>
   <updated>2010-10-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/malcolm-gladwell-bulls-eyes-wrong-target</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Anyone who enjoys complex ideas articulated compellingly, entertainingly and with style will enjoy Malcolm Gladwell&amp;#8217;s writings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His recent article in the New Yorker, called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/10/04/101004fa_fact_gladwell&quot; title=&quot;Small Change&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;Small Change&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; doesn&amp;#8217;t disappoint on the usual counts, but it adds a new feature I hadn&amp;#8217;t come across yet in his writing. It makes the wrong case.I&amp;#8217;m a fan. If there&amp;#8217;s room for disappointment in an indictment from someone I enjoy reading, it&amp;#8217;s that it seems like the effort is banal and contrived. Forgive me for living in a bubble, but I thought we were done with questions like &amp;#8220;why do I want to know what other people are eating for lunch&amp;#8221;? Malcolm Gladwell may the most insightful and articulate pundit to not &amp;#8220;get it&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case his prose brings to life focusses on Social Networking&amp;#8217;s failure as a replacement for revolutionary acts that result in social change. And maybe I missed a memo somewhere, but take it from someone whose career is about influencing people through media; you don&amp;#8217;t need a five page essay to make the point that it doesn&amp;#8217;t. Anyone who thinks otherwise has moved from kool-aid into heavier stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone who never considered a &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/&quot; title=&quot;Meetup.org&quot;&gt;Meetup&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; a replacement for standing in front of a tank, I think it would be a great tool to get supporters and documenters to the event. You want a fast &amp;#8220;sit-in&amp;#8221;, organize a &amp;#8220;tweet-up&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to plan in the dark, do it. But if you want to build relationships with people from all walks of life, varying demographics, undivided by space and time, solely connected through common interest, try Social Networking. It&amp;#8217;s the right tool for the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1oo people wished me happy Birthday on Facebook the other day. A bunch more on Twitter. World-changing? No. But it was nice. Some of them were folks I rarely connect with and it was a good reminder to stop and smell the roses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I support the fledgling efforts of the thousands of people who follow my @SlowFoodTO account on Twitter. Maybe they&amp;#8217;ll change the world one day. Many of them are undeniably working at it daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grist wrote an article the other day about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grist.org/article/2010-10-12-what-monsantos-fall-from-grace-reveals-abo-the-gmo-seed-industry/&quot;&gt;Monsanto&amp;#8217;s fall from king to doormat on Wallstreet&lt;/a&gt;. Among the reasons they cited were farmers realizing their yields were not as advertised. I bet they connected and discussed their issues online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of things you simply shouldn&amp;#8217;t spend time on Social Networking for, like hanging pictures at your house. But we&amp;#8217;re constantly discovering new connection opportunities, new awareness opportunities as this space rapidly evolves and we react to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I have officially ceased to be amazed by the number of &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/social-media-category/2818/why-do-smart-people-fear-social-media&quot;&gt;intelligent people who don&amp;#8217;t use it and claim that fact as indication that Social Networking is not useful&lt;/a&gt;, I haven&amp;#8217;t tired of teaching them about. These platforms are doing a lot to be more accessible to beginners and if you meet them halfway by scaling their short learning curves, you may find uses you weren&amp;#8217;t able to see before the climb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the article, Let me leave you with three questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Why the narrow focus? Social Networking is a medium like a telephone, not an act like Social Change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Why throw the baby out with the bath water? Just because it doesn&amp;#8217;t do what you want it to doesn&amp;#8217;t make it useless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Anyone else see Social Networking as the right tool for certain jobs? We&amp;#8217;ve had loads of successes–maybe our standards are a bit lower?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/10/04/101004fa_fact_gladwell?currentPage=5&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a title=&quot;Ass&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/37205550@N00/3068373319/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3154/3068373319_e93dd1cebf.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Ass&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;small&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Attribution License&quot; href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/photo-dropper/images/cc.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Creative Commons License&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.photodropper.com/photos/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;photo&lt;/a&gt; credit: &lt;a title=&quot;magnusfranklin&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/37205550@N00/3068373319/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;magnusfranklin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional marketing is akin to playing &amp;#8220;Pin-the-Tail-on-the-Donkey&amp;#8221;. Drunk. With an increasingly agile donkey. Big brands are clueing in, but it takes time to dismantle the elaborate donkey-pin buck-shot machine they&amp;#8217;ve invested in. And the situation isn&amp;#8217;t being helped by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Still landing a few pins–some people can&amp;#8217;t change until they&amp;#8217;ve exhausted all their options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  No easy transition from an exploitative approach to a trust/relationship-based model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Useless products, or ones that create their margins at the expense of others don&amp;#8217;t easily hold up under the transparency required online&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meaningful Marketing offers an approach that leads to more qualified leads. And works better when you see your prospects as people instead of donkeys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you (or your agency) aren&amp;#8217;t working on a strategy to shift your marketing towards connecting with your audiences on common interests instead of targeting them with your messages, maybe it&amp;#8217;s time to ask yourself who the ass is?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;color: #444444;&quot;&gt;This&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; image from the online version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.macleans.ca/2010/10/08/wait-is-that-mark-bittman/&quot;&gt;Macleans Magazine&amp;#8217;s visit to Fiesta Farms&lt;/a&gt; with celebrity chef, writer and sustainable food advocate Mark Bittman says more about the local food movement&amp;#8217;s progress than the print edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #444444;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.macleans.ca/2010/10/08/wait-is-that-mark-bittman/&quot;&gt;The &amp;#8220;LFP&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;BUY THIS TO VOTE&amp;#8221; signs you see in front of Mark &lt;/a&gt;indocate&lt;/span&gt; where you can find Ontario produce that&amp;#8217;s been certified &amp;#8220;local sustainable&amp;#8221; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://fiestafarms.ca/philosophy/what-is-local-food-plus#more-714&quot;&gt;Local Food Plus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Certification indicates that the producer has jumped through serious hoops to deliver food that wouldn&amp;#8217;t make you sick if you knew where it came from, what&amp;#8217;s in it, how it was made, how the people who made it are treated, how the animals were treated before volunteering to be dinner and what it took to get it here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://buytovote.com&quot; title=&quot;Buy This to Vote&quot;&gt;Buy This to Vote&lt;/a&gt; Campaign helps consumers make the connection between their purchasing choices and what&amp;#8217;s on offer at the grocery store, restaurants and in institutions. We made that! It&amp;#8217;ll be rolling out over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t wait until they see the other side of the aisle. When Macleans and Mark Bittman catch wind of programs like this that represent how amazingly food forward Ontario&amp;#8217;s non-profits and sustainable brands are, we&amp;#8217;re in for a meaty story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.macleans.ca/2010/10/08/wait-is-that-mark-bittman/&quot;&gt;Wait, is that Mark Bittman in aisle two? &amp;#8211; Arts &amp;amp; Culture, Books &amp;#8211; Macleans.ca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Vivian &#038; Bourdain: A Case Study in Leadership</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/3050/"/>
   <updated>2010-10-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/3050</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3053&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/3050/3050/attachment/screen-shot-2010-10-01-at-2-04-20-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-3053&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-10-01 at 2.04.20 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-01-at-2.04.20-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;244&quot; height=&quot;280&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Heard a great story from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thebeastrestaurant.com/&quot;&gt;Beast &lt;/a&gt;Restaurant chef + friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chefdb.com/nm/11289/&quot;&gt;Scott Vivian&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedrakehotel.ca/culture/86d&quot;&gt;The Drake&amp;#8217;s 86&amp;#8242;d&lt;/a&gt; Monday night (see? inspiration is everywhere&amp;#8211;see &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/blog/2820/how-to-be-a-prolific-blogger&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; for a reminder).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vivian&amp;#8217;s tale of meeting Anthony Bourdain highlighted  the importance of being a leader and the benefits that one derives from not just &amp;#8220;sell, sell, sell-ing&amp;#8221; yourself + what you offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here goes. Beast was invited to cater the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.anthonybourdain.net/&quot;&gt;Anthony Bourdain&lt;/a&gt; after-party following Bourdain&amp;#8217;s appearance at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.masseyhall.com/&quot;&gt;Massey Hall. &lt;/a&gt;Vivian was also asked to bring Bourdain a meal to his green room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, lots of people love Anthony Bourdain. And lots of people would like bragging rights to say they hung out with Bourdain, or even better, got featured on his TV show &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.travelchannel.com/TV_Shows/Anthony_Bourdain&quot;&gt;No Reservations. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, as Vivian describes it, people who were lined up to have their copies of Bourdains latest book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Medium-Raw-Bloody-Valentine-People/dp/0061718947&quot;&gt;Medium Raw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Medium-Raw-Bloody-Valentine-People/dp/0061718947&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;signed were shouting out requests like &amp;#8220;Hey Anthony, wanna go for dinner?&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Hey Anthony come to my restaurant.&amp;#8221; One fella even walked through the crowd just to give Bourdain a draft (draft??) beer, which he accepted and gracefully set aside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the show, when Vivian went backstage to deliver Bourdain his meal, the fellow chef welcomed Vivian in for a beer, and the two got to talking. Ya know. Chit chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the conversation turned to Bourdain&amp;#8217;s show, and Vivian asked why No Reservations had never filmed in Toronto. Bourdain replied that he&amp;#8217;d spent some time in Canada&amp;#8211;in Vancouver and Montreal, and that chefs in those towns slagged Toronto and its food-scene so badly, that Bourdain didn&amp;#8217;t think Toronto had much to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vivian took the opportunity to tell Bourdain about Toronto&amp;#8217;s food community&amp;#8211;the young chefs who often work together to put together incredible events and who give unprecedented profile and vitality to our food culture. He also told Bourdain about the range of ethic foods available on the cheap all throughout Toronto&amp;#8217;s neighbourhoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vivian finally said, (and I paraphrase): &amp;#8220;Listen, come to Toronto. And don&amp;#8217;t come to my restaurant, let me show you around. I&amp;#8217;ll take you to my favourite hidden spots  and you&amp;#8217;ll see how great Toronto is.&amp;#8221; To that Bourdain simply replied &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m going to bring No Reservations to Toronto, and we&amp;#8217;ll make TV together.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only did Bourdain make that offer to Vivian, but he repeated it again in front of a large group of people during the book signing. In addition, Bourdain made a point of praising Vivian and Beast from the stage in front of um, about 3000 foodies. Beast&amp;#8217;s phone has been ringing ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The  now-famous exchange between chefs has been covered in numerous publications including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.torontolife.com/daily/daily-dish/aprons-icons/2010/09/24/despite-some-reservations-toronto-will-appear-on-anthony-bourdain%E2%80%99s-no-reservations/&quot;&gt;Toronto Life&lt;/a&gt; and has been a hot topic in the foodie community. But, what&amp;#8217;s most impressive to me is not that Vivian had the chance to talk to Bourdain mano-a-mano. Or even that Bourdain wants to &amp;#8220;make TV&amp;#8221; (sound sexy when you say it like that) with Vivian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What blows my mind is how intuitively Vivian knows how to be a leader. And how that is what will ultimately bring No Reservations to Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before Bourdain came to town, Vivian was interviewed about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.postcity.com/Cityscape/restoronto/September-2010/Where-Beast-039s-Scott-Vivian-would-take-Anthony-Bourdain-in-TO/&quot;&gt;top five Toronto restaurants&lt;/a&gt; he&amp;#8217;d take Bourdain if given the chance. Look at the list. Notice anything interesting? Beast is nowhere on the list. Why? Because Vivian&amp;#8217;s a classy dude, and because Vivian is a true leader in Toronto&amp;#8217;s food movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The take away from this exchange should be clear; Don&amp;#8217;t make it about you and you&amp;#8217;ll succeed. Now, the &amp;#8216;it&amp;#8217; in this sentence refers to any kind of communication activity; a tweet, a facebook post, a blog, an interview, a print ad&amp;#8211;a job interview, a cocktail conversation for god sakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sales culture, like the kind featured in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104348/&quot;&gt;Glengarry Glen Ross&lt;/a&gt; still informs the way we approach how we do business (wow, I forgot how good this movie is.) Got leads? Sell them. Close them. A.B.C &amp;#8220;Always. Be. Closing.&amp;#8221;  Even though we work in open concept loft spaces, we still act like we work in boiler rooms like the ones in the movie. Why? Because we want instant results. And we don&amp;#8217;t trust that another way works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the truth is talking about yourself, selling yourself, pushing, pushing, pushing your wares is not what it takes to attract a following. We talk alot about communities, tribes, communities of interest. But do we really act as though we know what that means? As &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chrisbrogan.com/audience-or-community/&quot;&gt;Chris Brogan rightfully says&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;#8220;The difference between an audience and a community is which direction the chairs are pointing.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, what does it really take to build community?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes confidence not to be so obsessed with ROI that you can&amp;#8217;t let go and give power to the community&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes being a good listener and caring about what other people have to say and give them props when they deserve them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes an ego check. No, this isn&amp;#8217;t about you. Are you sure you can handle it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes understanding how these various tools work and the right way to use them to attract and retain the interest of communities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What else does it take? You to tell me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;ve ever agreed to fill out a customer survey and then regretted giving up your precious time, maybe you should watch more movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife and I just watched our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1022603/&quot;&gt;first movie&lt;/a&gt; on the newly-Canadian &lt;a href=&quot;http://netflix.ca&quot;&gt;Netflix.ca&lt;/a&gt; this past Saturday. It was a welcome departure from my usual trek to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestar.com/business/article/865294--blockbuster-bankruptcy-won-t-affect-canada-chain-says&quot;&gt;Blockbuster&lt;/a&gt;, where I get so overwhelmed by all the possibilities (hey &amp;#8211; we don&amp;#8217;t even have cable) that I dawdle, and my wife is too tired to watch by the time I get home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie played without a hitch. As is typical, I dozed off mid-movie, to my wife&amp;#8217;s chagrin. But I caught the missed bits on my iphone, while I waited for take-out the next day. (An entertaining new use for my &amp;#8216;found&amp;#8217; time.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the most remarkable thing about Netflix so far has been the simplicity of the follow up. Today I got an email from Netflix inquiring about the picture and audio quality of their service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear [Rick],&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You recently watched (500) Days of Summer. To help us ensure a great experience for all members, would you take a moment to tell us about the picture and audio quality?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The quality was very good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The quality was acceptable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The quality was unacceptable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your help!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Your friends at Netflix&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was genuinely taken aback by the remarkable restraint: A survey of just one question!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s nice to see a service both wants my feedback and respects my time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could it be that Netflix has learned that relationships are built over time? And that if they make it easy for me, I will happily share my likes and frustrations, ongoing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, I clicked. I&amp;#8217;m interested to see where this relationship is headed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which begs the question: Are there ways that you can make it easy for your customers to give you feedback that both respects their valued time, and enables you to serve them better? Tools like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kissinsights.com/&quot; title=&quot;Kiss Insights&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://goodgecko.com/tour/genie&quot; title=&quot;goodgecko Genie&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; might be a start. Know of any others?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Food matters. And so does building community.</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/food-matters-and-so-does-building-community/"/>
   <updated>2010-09-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/food-matters-and-so-does-building-community</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mark Bittman was in Toronto this week promoting his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Food-Matters-Cookbook-Revolutionary-Recipes/dp/1439120234/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1284660910&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;Food Matters Cookbook. &lt;/a&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve long been a fan of Bittman and have followed him as he&amp;#8217;s embraced a more values based approach to eating&amp;#8211;for which he&amp;#8217;s now become a key spokesperson. His TED talk on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ted.com/talks/mark_bittman_on_what_s_wrong_with_what_we_eat.html&quot;&gt;What&amp;#8217;s Wrong with What we Eat&lt;/a&gt; makes a great case for reducing our consumption of meat and junk and tipping the scales in favour of a plant based diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to Bittman&amp;#8217;s talk at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestop.org/&quot;&gt;The Stop&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; Wychwood Barns, I saw this tweet (via a great tool called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socialmention.com/&quot;&gt;Social Mention&lt;/a&gt;) that said that Bittman was at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fiestafarms.ca&quot;&gt;Fiesta Farms,&lt;/a&gt; filming something for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.macleans.ca/&quot;&gt;Maclean&amp;#8217;s magazine &lt;/a&gt;article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3036&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/socialmedia-2/3035/food-matters-and-so-does-building-community/attachment/screen-shot-2010-09-29-at-11-27-25-am&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-3036&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-09-29 at 11.27.25 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Screen-shot-2010-09-29-at-11.27.25-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;359&quot; height=&quot;191&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heard of him? Yeah, I heard of him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may know, Fiesta Farms is one of Hypenotic&amp;#8217;s clients. So, it would have been nice to capture Bittman in the aisles of the store, or even get him to say a few words about what he enjoyed about his experience. But I figured the next best thing would be to go to his book launch event (which frankly I was planning to do anyway) with my little &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theflip.com/en-ca/&quot;&gt;Flip camera &lt;/a&gt;in hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the talk I was a little dismayed when Bittman&amp;#8217;s publicity people treated folks who wanted books signed like children; asking us to come up row by row and putting a little sticky note with our names on  them on the inside flap where Bittman would so graciously sign. Way to take all the personalization out of the meet + greet process folks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the signings were finished, I waited for my moment. I politely asked Bittman for a few words about his experience at Fiesta Farms and asked if it&amp;#8217;d be ok if I filmed him. Though he obliged, as you can see from this video, he was irritated by my filming. He was literally packing up as we were talking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve now had a chance to read Bittman&amp;#8217;s account of his time in Toronto in his &lt;a href=&quot;http://markbittman.com/the-food-matters-cookbook-chronicles-toronto&quot;&gt;Food Matters Chronicles&lt;/a&gt; and the pieces of the puzzle are coming together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am just going to say it. Bittman&amp;#8217;s a bit of a curmudgeon when it comes to social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his Chronicles, Bittman recalls his lunch with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goodfoodrev.com/&quot;&gt;Good Food Revolution&amp;#8217;&lt;/a&gt;s Malcolm Jolley in the following way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a sit-down with Malcolm Jolley of Good Food, who insisted on taping the conversation with a little camera in front of his face the whole time, which seems to be au courant, though why you&amp;#8217;d rather plough through a video in real time than read a writer&amp;#8217;s analysis of it is beyond me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bittman, like Jolley, is a food writer (for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/author/mark-bittman/&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.) Clearly, Bittman puts the written word up on a pedestal. But, in the age of social media, why is &amp;#8216;telling&amp;#8217; better (or more journalistic) than &amp;#8216;showing?&amp;#8217;  Good Food Rev mixes up high quality writing and high quality video. The combination makes for a dynamic, readable online publication. Anyway, why dis another food journalist out there spreading the gospel? We all have the same agenda around food, don&amp;#8217;t we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Bittman misidentifies Jolley&amp;#8217;s publication as &amp;#8220;Good Food&amp;#8221; not Good Food Revolution and doesn&amp;#8217;t even bother to embed the url to Good Food Revolution to drive more people to the site. Bittman gets alot of readers on his site. It would have been very generous to properly identify the publication and share the link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to be part of a food community, you should give kudos to those working to spread the word. Good Food Revolution covering the Food Matters Cookbook means more cookbook sales for Mark Bittman. So maybe he could be less grumpy. But even more important, promoting good food grows the entire movement. How &amp;#8217;bout you throw Malcolm a bone by promoting the good work on his site Mr. Bittman?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#8217;s not the only factoid that Mark Bittman got wrong. If you scroll down the page to the comments, you can see that Jason McBride, Communications Coordinator at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestop.org/&quot;&gt;The Stop&lt;/a&gt;, bothered to write a comment to correct Bittman&amp;#8217;s misspelling of &amp;#8216;Wychwood&amp;#8217; and to identify &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestop.org/&quot;&gt;The Stop&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; link so Bittman&amp;#8217;s gazillion readers could find their way to this fabulous &amp;#8220;Food Matters&amp;#8221; type organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time Mark Bittman tries to elevate his type of &amp;#8220;written&amp;#8221;  food journalism (the New York Times type I guess) he demonstrates that his fact-checking chops are as weak as his social media muscles. Don&amp;#8217;t get me wrong, I like Mark Bittman and what he stands for. But, he could use a lesson in supporting the food community that matters, not only to selling books, but to changing the world.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Locawashing vs. The Authenticity Hoax</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3022&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaningfulmarketing/3013/locawashing-vs-the-authenticity-hoax/attachment/screen-shot-2010-09-27-at-3-57-09-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-3022&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-09-27 at 3.57.09 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Screen-shot-2010-09-27-at-3.57.09-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;322&quot; height=&quot;243&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Greenwashing, and its variants are not new. Because values sell, marketers flaunt their faux-values to attract sales when there is, in fact, very little to substantiate their lofty claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a fun greenwashing game called &lt;a href=&quot;http://sinsofgreenwashing.org/games-tools/name-that-sin-game/&quot;&gt;Name that Sin&lt;/a&gt; that encourages you to identify which deceiving tactic brands are using to trick you into thinking they are environmentally friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should not be surprising that the local food movement has its own version of greenwashing&amp;#8211;let&amp;#8217;s call it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newrules.org/node/2853/&quot;&gt;Locawashing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two recent examples have given me new cause to consider the meaning and impact of Locawashing; The first is the prevalence of &lt;a href=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703399404575506562162038450.html&quot;&gt;fake Farmers Market stands&lt;/a&gt; set up by major retailers like Albertson&amp;#8217;s in the US; The second is Canada Bread&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.countryharvest.com/en/community/canadian-wheat&quot;&gt;Country Harvest&lt;/a&gt; brand featuring ads and POP materials featuring the faces of the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; farmers who make their wheat&amp;#8211;which then gets turned into processed bread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often the conversation  about these issues revolves around language. What is a farmers market? What does local mean? Who is a locavore? As per the case with Safeway and Albertsons setting up Farmers Markets at the front steps of their stores, there&amp;#8217;s a concern about what these terms mean once they are appropriated by industry:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farmers and their supporters have spent several decades building &amp;#8220;farmers&amp;#8217; market&amp;#8221; into a brand that signifies something specific to consumers, namely, locally grown produce fresh off the farm&amp;#8230;there is a fear on the part of farmers&amp;#8217; groups that the term could become so diluted that the public no longer feels the need to visit the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want these terms to mean something &lt;em&gt;real. *We want to see/feel/touch the *real *thing when we go to Farmer&amp;#8217;s markets. Is there something suspicious in *our&lt;/em&gt; desire for authenticity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his new book &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.ca/Authenticity-Hoax-Lost-Finding-Ourselves/dp/0771071051&quot;&gt;The Authenticity Hoax&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbc.ca/thenextchapter/2010/09/andrew-potter.html&quot;&gt;streamed version available from CBC interview available here&lt;/a&gt;) Andrew Potter argues that the search for the *real *or *authentic *is at the root of many of our current problems. He sees the search for authenticity as &amp;#8220;dopey nostalgia.&amp;#8221; Potter sees the local food movement as socially pernicious because it helps people &amp;#8220;feel good&amp;#8221; (e.g. buying local makes me feel good, spiritually) but it keeps them from questioning whether that serves a higher, &amp;#8220;real&amp;#8221; social good (impacting the environment, our health, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think? Is there something suspicious about wanting terms like local and farmers market to mean something? Is Potter onto something? Should we preserve the integrity of these terms so that the fake versions don&amp;#8217;t pass as real? How would we do that anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Sponsorship means Supporting the Issues Not Your Brand</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/leading-by-supporting-the-issues/"/>
   <updated>2010-09-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/leading-by-supporting-the-issues</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Participating in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.endcancer.ca/&quot;&gt;The Weekend to End Women&amp;#8217;s Cancers&lt;/a&gt; was an incredibly moving experience. The 12 members of the Cancer is Crap team joined together to remember and celebrate &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chatelaine.com/livingwithbreastcancer/&quot;&gt;Leanne. &lt;/a&gt;It was an uplifting and inspiring event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2970&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaningfulmarketing/2905/leading-by-supporting-the-issues/attachment/screen-shot-2010-09-22-at-4-55-06-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-med wp-image-2970 alignleft&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-09-22 at 4.55.06 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Screen-shot-2010-09-22-at-4.55.06-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;584&quot; height=&quot;475&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event was a success because of many people–the walkers, the donors, the volunteers, and of course, the sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that corporate sponsors don&amp;#8217;t only have altruistic reasons for getting behind events, but we hope that their intentions are mostly good. There&amp;#8217;s nothing wrong with a &amp;#8220;win-win&amp;#8221; that benefits both the corporate donor and the cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While corporate sponsorship has an important role in charity events, there&amp;#8217;s a very line that must be tread. When people are engaged in an authentic and meaningful experiences, marketing messages that make participants feel like the experience is manufactured are unwelcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to shine a light on two sponsorship mis-steps at the Weekend to End Women&amp;#8217;s Cancers to demonstrate the importance of sponsors supporting events and issues from the sidelines. The key is letting the &amp;#8220;halo effect&amp;#8221; work its magic instead of being seen to wrestle with the cause for the limelight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www1.shoppersdrugmart.ca/en/Home.aspx&quot;&gt;Shoppers Drug Mart &lt;/a&gt;was the new, national sponsor for this year&amp;#8217;s walk. In Toronto the walk wound its way through Toronto streets from the Princess Margaret gates all the way to Downsview Park and then back the following day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The route was designed so that participants would walk by Shoppers&amp;#8217; stores all along the route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, we were all walking 32K a day no matter where we walked, but it somehow made a lot of the walkers feel &amp;#8216;duped.&amp;#8217; And hell hath no fury like a woman with sore feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was just a bad move for Shoppers to make walkers feel like the stores were dictating the route. It created a perception that people were being forced &amp;#8220;out of their way&amp;#8221; to be reminded that Shoppers was the sponsor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Um, we already knew you sponsored the event Shoppers. And we were happy about that until you made yourself seem more important than the issue and all of the women walking in support of it. The best route to follow would have been to support the people who go to the ends of their driveways serving everything from Lemonade to pastries to support the walkers. Enable and support them by providing a &amp;#8216;cheering kit&amp;#8217; and you&amp;#8217;ll have a true win win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jnjcanada.com/&quot;&gt;Johnson and Johnson&lt;/a&gt; hosted lunch on the first day of the walk. Lots of people needed Band Aids for sore, blistered feet while walking so the donations of Band Aids were obviously welcomed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But J&amp;amp;J&amp;#8217;s lunch also featured a Karaoke station featuring the old school jingle &amp;#8220;I am Stuck on Band Aid &amp;#8216;Cause Band Aid&amp;#8217;s stuck on me!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone thought it&amp;#8217;d be a great idea to set up a karaoke booth at the rest stop and have J&amp;amp;J donate $1 to Women&amp;#8217;s Cancers every time someone sang the Band Aid song into the microphone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2957&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaningfulmarketing/2905/leading-by-supporting-the-issues/attachment/screen-shot-2010-09-22-at-4-44-27-pm-2&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-2957&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-09-22 at 4.44.27 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Screen-shot-2010-09-22-at-4.44.27-PM1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;528&quot; height=&quot;94&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The net effect? A bunch on tired, hungry women walkers had the distinct pleasure of hearing that damned jingle over and over when they had a moment&amp;#8217;s rest before hitting the pavement again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than creating a positive impression, J&amp;amp;J created a negative one. A better solution? How about sponsoring the medic stations where walkers went to deal with their injured feet. How about hosting a karaoke station with uplifting songs like &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;I will Survive&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;These Boots Were Made for Walking&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; and posting videos to YouTube?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how can a sponsor do good without being perceived as self-serving?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Stand Back.&lt;/strong&gt; Sponsors don&amp;#8217;t need to be in the spotlight. In fact the more they are seen to be championing the issue without promoting themselves, the more positive perceptions they&amp;#8217;ll create. That doesn&amp;#8217;t mean you can&amp;#8217;t have your name on the banner–it just means let the issue be first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; *&lt;em&gt;Be Seen to Support: *&lt;/em&gt;Sponsors can support causes by being seen &amp;#8220;on the ground&amp;#8221; walking, volunteering and pitching in. They can also support the cause by using their presence in the community to grow attendance at the event. Retail stores offer great opportunities to reach people. Sure it&amp;#8217;s nice to have the brochures on the cash station, but what else can you do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Be Useful&lt;/strong&gt;: What can you do to actually add value for the people who are busting their chops? If it&amp;#8217;s not actually useful then why are you doing it? Consider what different audiences need during the course of an event–volunteers, walkers, family and friend supporters, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; *&lt;em&gt;Make the Most of the Event: *&lt;/em&gt;What can you do before, during and after to enhance the event. Most events are over in one day. That&amp;#8217;s a pretty short lifespan. Consider what would be of value at other times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are as many ways to build relationships by supporting and promoting the people who participate in events as there are participants. Can anyone else think of any?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Culinary Tourism &#038; Brand Ambassadors</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/culinary-tourism-brand-ambassadors/"/>
   <updated>2010-09-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/culinary-tourism-brand-ambassadors</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I was 19, I backpacked across Europe with four friends. Thank goodness my trip pre-dates the internet; that summer doesn&amp;#8217;t belong on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hopped over to Israel from Greece to meet relatives I&amp;#8217;d never met. Israel was fascinating on many levels, but this is about a bad experience. $400 in Traveller&amp;#8217;s Cheques were stolen at my hostel in Tel Aviv. When my cousin caught wind of the news, he came straight over and insisted I take $400 from him. He could have loaned me $50 to get by or bought me a couple of beers to help me get over it, but he was adamantly committed to doing his part to improve my memory of his city. And he did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tel Aviv didn&amp;#8217;t know it, but they had a brand Ambassador in my cousin Benny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just got off the plane from Halifax this weekend where I had plenty of opportunities to think about brand ambassadors for places. I was presenting at an event called &amp;#8220;One World One Table&amp;#8221;, hosted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.culinarytourism.org/&quot; title=&quot;The International Culinary Tourism Association&quot;&gt;ICTA&lt;/a&gt; (The International Culinary Tourism Association) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tasteofnovascotia.com/&quot; title=&quot;Taste of Nova Scotia&quot;&gt;Taste of Nova Scotia&lt;/a&gt;. I met Food Inc. Producer/Director Robert Kenner and his charming wife Marguerite, Celebrity Chef + P.E.I. ambassador Michael Smith, and a lot of really interesting folks from 16 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also had a brand ambassador experience that stamped a first impression on me that will forever make Nova Scotia a place I look forward to getting back to, exploring more of, and telling other people about. But it didn&amp;#8217;t happen at the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doug Townsend (&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/douglastee&quot; title=&quot;Doug Townsend on Twitter&quot;&gt;@DouglasTee&lt;/a&gt;), Director of Marketing for Taste of Novia Scotia and his wife Renée Lavallée (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feistychef.ca/&quot; title=&quot;Feisty Chef website&quot;&gt;feistychef.ca&lt;/a&gt;) showed us such an intimate, convivial, informative and delectable experience that I left thinking hospitality was endemic to the culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d had a few interactions w/Renée on twitter (&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/feistychef&quot; title=&quot;Renée Lavallée on Twitter&quot;&gt;@feistychef&lt;/a&gt;), and a few more with Doug after the two or three strategy phone calls I had with the ICTA and Taste teams as they planned the event. But that was enough for Doug to pick us up at the airport, meet us at Halifax&amp;#8217;s swell new &lt;a href=&quot;http://halifaxfarmersmarket.com/seaport/&quot;&gt;Seaport Market&lt;/a&gt;, lend us a car to visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.explorelunenburg.ca/&quot; title=&quot;Explore Lunenberg Nova Scotia&quot;&gt;Lunenberg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chesterareans.ca/&quot; title=&quot;Chester Nova Scotia&quot;&gt;Chester&lt;/a&gt; and to host us for dinner. Did I mention Renée is a Chef?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_2918&quot; style=&quot;width: 260px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2918&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/branding/2904/culinary-tourism-brand-ambassadors/attachment/img_1545&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-thumbnail wp-image-2918&quot; title=&quot;Fresh Clams and Scallops&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/IMG_1545-250x250.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    Clams + Scallops jumped from the ocean, to Renée + Doug&#39;s door, and into the pot.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Doug and Renée were busy as all hell between two kids and high-alert conference responsibilities. But writer Stephanie Ortenzi (&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/stachio&quot;&gt;@stachio&lt;/a&gt;), Rebecca LeHeup (&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/ontarioculinary&quot;&gt;@OntarioCulinary&lt;/a&gt;) and Noelle Munaretto from OCTA + Jodi and I were treated to local cheese (Dragon&amp;#8217;s Breath of course) and other treats Renée and Doug picked up at the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We chatted standing in the kitchen while Doug shucked oysters and poured &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drinkpropeller.ca/&quot;&gt;Propeller beer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renée concocted clams and scallops around us (never had scallops in the shell before). She handled harpooned swordfish, and served two of the best salads I&amp;#8217;ve ever had, composed of, again, fresh fare from local producers picked up Saturday AM at the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might imagine, the only way to wrap a visceral experience like this was with a crack cocaine level sensorial hit in the form of a salt-baked pear drizzled and sitting in home made caramel. So we did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_2922&quot; style=&quot;width: 260px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2922&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/branding/2904/culinary-tourism-brand-ambassadors/attachment/img_1561&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-thumbnail wp-image-2922&quot; title=&quot;Desert cocaine&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/IMG_1561-250x250.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    Salt baked pear in home made caramel
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if that wasn&amp;#8217;t enough, Chef Craig Flinn (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/craigcooks&quot; title=&quot;Chef Craig Flinn on Twitter&quot;&gt;@craigcooks&lt;/a&gt;) hosted us at Chives Canadian Bistro. That experience could be a chapter in a book about the senses. Suffice it to say that he was more than an amazing host, the impression he created transcended the heavenly meal. He walked us through each course, shared wine from his personal stock, answered questions and then let us buy him a drink at a pub down the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And speaking of drinking, I headed out with the team from Taste of Nova Scotia on Monday night and ended up sitting next to another multi-talented ambassador for Nova Scotia–Chef Michael Howell (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mhowellgtc&quot; title=&quot;Chef Michael Howell of Tempest on Twitter&quot;&gt;@MHowellGTC&lt;/a&gt;), owner of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tempest.ca/&quot; title=&quot;Tempest World Cuisine&quot;&gt;Tempest&lt;/a&gt;. We talked for two hours straight and it turns out we&amp;#8217;ll be continuing the dialogue at Slow Food&amp;#8217;s Terra Madre in Torino.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not sure what brand &amp;#8220;messaging&amp;#8221; could have made an impression on me that would be as significant as the one created by the Diplomats I met over my five day visit. As a professional who&amp;#8217;s conscious of these things, it seems like the needle Nova Scotia is moving in the world is about &amp;#8216;hospitality&amp;#8217; and that just about anyone there is empowered to move it forward in their own way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to all for the experience, the memories and the lesson in modern brand strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Online, Guru is spelled RTFM</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/online-guru-is-spelled-rtfm/"/>
   <updated>2010-09-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/online-guru-is-spelled-rtfm</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The motto of Social Media is &amp;#8220;if you get it, share it&amp;#8221;. So in the spirit of giving it away, let me spell out the secret to becoming an expert on the web&amp;#8217;s most amazing tools, tactics, and platforms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RTFM (Read The Fucking Manual)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web offers mind-blowing resources for &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/&quot; title=&quot;Techcrunch&quot;&gt;what&amp;#8217;s new&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mashable.com/&quot; title=&quot;Mashable&quot;&gt;what&amp;#8217;s next&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.readwriteweb.com/&quot; title=&quot;Read Write Web&quot;&gt;how it&amp;#8217;s impacting business&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.casestudiesonline.com/&quot; title=&quot;Social Media Case Studies&quot;&gt;case studies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://lifehacker.com/&quot; title=&quot;Life Hacker&quot;&gt;how-tos&lt;/a&gt;. There are ratings for everything, even &lt;a href=&quot;http://alltop.com/&quot; title=&quot;Alltop&quot;&gt;ratings for the raters&lt;/a&gt;. There are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.commoncraft.com/rss_plain_english&quot; title=&quot;Video: RSS in plain English&quot;&gt;great ways to filter&lt;/a&gt; if it&amp;#8217;s all too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re in too much of a hurry to filter your own information, you can use the greatest answer machine since the Wizard of Oz. Just type your question into the white box and a team of San Franciscan hampsters with PHDs get on their bicycle powered filtering wheels and process all the news in the world into a prioritized list for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2887&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/social-media-category/2885/online-guru-is-spelled-rtfm/attachment/screen-shot-2010-09-09-at-5-20-07-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-2887&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-09-09 at 5.20.07 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Screen-shot-2010-09-09-at-5.20.07-PM-580x234.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;234&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I could be accused of facetiousness, it would only be in that people are too busy and would rather pay for answers and leave this area of expertise to people like Hypenotic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we do hope that keeps happening, as we&amp;#8217;re committed to staying on top of the ways people are being influenced by media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My point was simply that in this hyper-fast era, reading the instructions can be just enough to put you in the lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The irony is that the best brands are going out of their way on a design, usability and documentation level to make it easy for people to address, interact with and get value from their products/services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d say that if there&amp;#8217;s single a difference between people who get ahead online and people who feel like they&amp;#8217;re being left behind it&amp;#8217;s intrepidness. The willingness to look around corners. Figure things out. Push buttons and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that it&amp;#8217;s a learned skill. I wasn&amp;#8217;t the kind of kid who took apart toasters to see how they worked but it wasn&amp;#8217;t hard to be inspired by the amazing things we can do with technology.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Pushing the Boundaries of Location “Check Ins”</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/pushing-the-boundaries-of-location-check-ins/"/>
   <updated>2010-09-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/pushing-the-boundaries-of-location-check-ins</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s get straight to this, &amp;#8217;cause this is some funny stuff. Two small caveats:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; This is NSFW (put on those headphones)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; This is not safe for people without a sense of humour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Location services like &lt;a href=&quot;http://foursquare.com/&quot;&gt;Foursquare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://gowalla.com/&quot;&gt;Gowalla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://gowalla.com/&quot;&gt;Yelp&lt;/a&gt; and most recently &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/places/&quot;&gt;Facebook Places&lt;/a&gt; give you the ability to sign-in at locations like restaurants, bars, grocery stores, and share your location and tips with friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It raises the question of whether any place is a good place to check in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not long ago, I noticed a woman checking in on Foursquare at a place called &lt;a href=&quot;http://foursquare.com/venue/5538288&quot;&gt;Discount Cigarettes&lt;/a&gt; in Pesacola Florida. Why would you want to brag about hanging at a place like that? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flowtown.com/blog/the-worst-places-to-be-the-foursquare-mayor&quot;&gt;Others have suggested &lt;/a&gt;that places like &amp;#8220;happy ending&amp;#8221; massage parlours and pawn shops may not be the kind of places you want to tell your network you&amp;#8217;re hanging out at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should you sign in at Church and Synagogue? &lt;a href=&quot;http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100605192637AA1OpIz&quot;&gt;People &lt;/a&gt;are starting to consider these questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think? Are there places that should be off bounds for &amp;#8216;check-ins&amp;#8217;?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Tapping into Fiesta Farms’ Quirky Authenticity</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/tapping-into-fiesta-farms-quirky-authenticity/"/>
   <updated>2010-09-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/tapping-into-fiesta-farms-quirky-authenticity</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve had a bit too much fun lately creating video content for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fiestafarms.ca&quot; title=&quot;FiestaFarms&quot;&gt;Fiesta Farms. &lt;/a&gt;First we helped the staff of Fiesta fete the new Mayor of Fiesta Farms on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foursquare.com/&quot; title=&quot;Foursquare&quot;&gt;Foursquare&lt;/a&gt;, and then we made a Double Rainbow spoof video to promote &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestop.org/invest-in-a-stop-share&quot;&gt;Grow for the Stop &lt;/a&gt;veggies&amp;#8217; arrival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy for Fiesta Farms is based on the idea that Food Matters for different people for a number of different reasons&amp;#8211;but that for Fiesta Farms&amp;#8217; shoppers it&amp;#8217;s always about more than filling their fridge and their bellies. But that doesn&amp;#8217;t mean we have to be earnest all the time. In fact, we&amp;#8217;ll leave that job to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/&quot;&gt;Whole Foods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiesta Farms is Toronto&amp;#8217;s largest independent grocery store. That gives them the freedom to buy from farms and entrepreneurs other, bigger guys, can&amp;#8217;t. But it also gives them them the ability to be a little off beat. If you&amp;#8217;ve been to the store, you know that it has a little quirk deep in its bones. It&amp;#8217;s an unpolished space. Its employees feel like real people. Its owner, Joe Virgona, is an iracible guy who has a heart of gold.  And that&amp;#8217;s what makes Fiesta Farms so easy to love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a lot of fun playing up Fiesta&amp;#8217;s charmingly quirky side. Too much fun perhaps. But eating your veggies doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, special thanks to the super-duper talented Aaron at &lt;a href=&quot;http://tarazatstudios.com/&quot;&gt;Tarazat Studios &lt;/a&gt;who leant us a hand with editing the Mayor video.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Many of you who&amp;#8217;ve worked with us will recognize this style of graphic recording from our brainstorm sessions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      We use it as a way to report on ideas and insights in a way that both demonstrates relationships as well inspires people who aren&amp;#8217;t used to using Design thinking to solve problems. When they see their ideas come to life in colour, they&amp;#8217;re motivated to continue the process.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      We learned many of our research and ideation methodologies from the now disbanded Bell Delta Centre, but there&amp;#8217;s a healthy community of ideation professionals all over the place.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I thought it worth sharing now, despite the almost 3 million views, because I&amp;#8217;ve also read Drive, and really enjoyed it. It&amp;#8217;s one of those reads that just feels right. The book is filled with ideas that sound right, and it&amp;#8217;s a relief to see them backed up by by research and represented compellingly.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

   <title>Forget Social Media–go read a newspaper</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/forget-social-media-go-read-a-newspaper/"/>
   <updated>2010-09-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/forget-social-media-go-read-a-newspaper</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a fun tip for those still scaling the &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t get it&amp;#8221; side of the social media peak. Particularly if part of of what&amp;#8217;s challenging you is the way &amp;#8220;updates&amp;#8221; look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first rule you (should) learn on Twitter is that no one cares what you&amp;#8217;re doing, unless who you are adds perspective to that activity. I care what chefs and farmers eat, but otherwise find meal updates are banal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully it won&amp;#8217;t be long after that that you learn to get off Twitter&amp;#8217;s homepage and onto software (like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tweetdeck.com/&quot;&gt;Tweetdeck&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://hootsuite.com//&quot;&gt;Hootsuite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://seesmic.com/&quot;&gt;Seesmic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.squidoo.com/twitterapps&quot; title=&quot;Twitter Apps list motherlode&quot;&gt;etc&lt;/a&gt;) that makes it easier for you to process all the information and insight traded daily on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you&amp;#8217;re not up to a professional tool, or learning something new isn&amp;#8217;t an option for you right now, &lt;a href=&quot;http://paper.li/hypenoticbam&quot; title=&quot;Barry Martin Twitter as Newspaper page&quot;&gt;paper.li &lt;/a&gt;is here to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It displays the content pointed to by the people you&amp;#8217;re following as a newspaper. Something we&amp;#8217;re all familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_2866&quot; style=&quot;width: 590px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2866&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/socialmedia-2/2842/forget-social-media%e2%80%93go-read-a-newspaper/attachment/screen-shot-2010-09-07-at-3-30-17-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-2866&quot; title=&quot;Paper.li_Twitter_As newspaper&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Screen-shot-2010-09-07-at-3.30.17-PM-580x528.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;528&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    My Twitter stream as a newspaper
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond familiarity, it&amp;#8217;s a nice way to process the information because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  you can see more of it before choosing to click the link to the source.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  the articles are organized by category/subject matter for easy scanning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more expensive alternative would be to get your hands on an ipad and download &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flipboard.com/&quot;&gt;Flipboard&lt;/a&gt;. It helps turn Facebook&amp;#8217;s horrendous interface into a pleasurable way to peruse news from your network. It also, (currently, though this must be changing soon), let&amp;#8217;s you add up to seven other RSS streams to your personal newspaper. All beautifully rendered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will this be the thing that helps you start to appreciate Social Media?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://paper.li/hypenoticbam&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;

   <title>Backtalk: Bang for your social media buck</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/2845/"/>
   <updated>2010-09-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/2845</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2850&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/social-media-category/2845/2845/attachment/screen-shot-2010-09-07-at-2-36-12-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2850&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-09-07 at 2.36.12 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Screen-shot-2010-09-07-at-2.36.12-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;280&quot; height=&quot;262&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Those of us raised in the &amp;#8216;computer age&amp;#8217; forget to marvel at the incredible innovations we&amp;#8217;ve seen and how they&amp;#8217;ve transformed our lives. Applications and devices add complex, amazing features every day and we barely blink an eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s take a moment to marvel at one small innovation: The response video. But first, consider one of its earlier incarnations–the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_song&quot;&gt;answer song&lt;/a&gt;. The answer song (as I discovered on CBC&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.randysvinyltap.com/main.php&quot;&gt;Vinyl Tap&lt;/a&gt;) is a song made in response to another song. So, Mary Wells records &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1M5eEJeT38&quot;&gt;My Guy &lt;/a&gt;and a year later, in response, The Temptations record &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltRwmgYEUr8&quot;&gt;My Girl&lt;/a&gt; (turns out &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smokey_Robinson&quot;&gt;Smokey Robinson &lt;/a&gt;wrote both songs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hip Hop&amp;#8217;s (Warning: Major NSFW!) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1456295/20020725/too_short.jhtml&quot;&gt;version of the answer song &lt;/a&gt;takes a slightly different turn. So, Hip Hop star Khia records (Waring: Major NSFW!) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMCMlNyySvo&quot;&gt;My Neck My Back&lt;/a&gt; in praise of female sexuality and frankly cunnilingus&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMCMlNyySvo&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Too Short cooks up a misogynistic response entitled (Waring: Major NSFW!) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-re6vhCCFc&quot;&gt;My Dick My Sack.&lt;/a&gt; Well, we&amp;#8217;ve traveled some distance from the My Guy/My Girl era. Moving on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s involved in coming up with an &amp;#8216;answer&amp;#8217; song?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A person has to hear a song, then go into a recording studio, then cut a track and get it out there. There&amp;#8217;s a lot of time lost between inspiration and response. And time is of the essence for those of us who get itchy waiting for the bank machine to spit out our money–never mind the teller from days of yore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now consider what&amp;#8217;s involved in making a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;amp;answer=57931&quot;&gt;YouTube video response. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;amp;answer=57931&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;With the technology of new smaller video cameras like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theflip.com/en-ca/&quot;&gt;Flip&lt;/a&gt; or our current favorite&lt;a href=&quot;http://store.kodak.com/store/ekconsus/en_US/pd/Zi8_Pocket_Video_Camera/productID.156585800&quot;&gt; Kodak Xi8&lt;/a&gt;, making video is a no-brainer. And uploading video has never been simpler. Although, truth be told, uploading video can be more time consuming than you&amp;#8217;d think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When responding to an existing video on YouTube, you can either make and upload a new video, or you can choose a video you&amp;#8217;ve already uploaded. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/youtube/thread?tid=5468ba4cf86003d1&amp;amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s some information on both approaches.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits of creating a response video are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  If the original video is well viewed, chances are yours will be too. A pretty decent response to the wildly popular &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQSNhk5ICTI&quot;&gt;Double Rainbow video &lt;/a&gt;(over 14 million views) called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJALEAgZeG8&amp;amp;feature=watch_response&quot;&gt;Double Rainbow Song&lt;/a&gt; received over 34 thousand views. Far more than it probably would have received on its own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  It&amp;#8217;s a much more creative way to &amp;#8216;comment&amp;#8217; on a video.Beyonce&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4m1EFMoRFvY&amp;amp;ob=av3e&quot;&gt;Single Ladies&lt;/a&gt; has 34 video responses, from kids to plus sized single ladies to this woman (video below) with a little piece of advice for her single friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  It acknowledges that one video inspired another even though there may not be a direct link between the two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Point is, you can respond quickly and creatively without very much effort at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S Watch for a special Hypenotic response video hitting the airwaves tomorrow. So much fun!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why do smart people fear Social Media?</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/why-do-smart-people-fear-social-media/"/>
   <updated>2010-09-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/why-do-smart-people-fear-social-media</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s something about Social Media that polarizes people. People either &amp;#8220;get it&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.sysomos.com/2010/08/05/why-some-companies-dont-get-social-media/&quot; title=&quot;Why executives don&amp;#39;t get Social Media&quot;&gt;don&amp;#8217;t get it&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;. Are addicted to it or despise it. The only thing we agree on is that everyone has an opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a dynamic website, multiple twitter accounts, and the campaigns we run for clients, I&amp;#8217;m obviously a proponent, but I&amp;#8217;m not going to sell you on it in this post. I&amp;#8217;m interested in teasing out what it is that inspires a particular mind-set in the anti-camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It never ceases to amaze me how many smart people I sit across from in meetings and at events that say things like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t get it. It doesn&amp;#8217;t make sense/It&amp;#8217;s a waste of time/I&amp;#8217;ll never do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How those two statements end up next to each other eludes me. It&amp;#8217;s like they&amp;#8217;re saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My shoe is on fire. Want a coconut?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;poolcustomizerandy&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/44550075@N08/4949191860/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4148/4949191860_4aa9fcf4ac.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;poolcustomizerandy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;evris28&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/44550075@N08/4949191860/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;To me, the first sentence suggests further investigation is required. &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t get it&amp;#8221;, is an opportunity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Other people probably don&amp;#8217;t either, and you might be able to get a head start by diving in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  You may find a new way of doing things that saves you time, money, energy or is simply more fun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the possibilities are endless. And the people we meet tend to be hard driving intra or entrepreneurs. One assumes they&amp;#8217;ve had the imagination to envision something that others could not to get where they are. So what is it about Social Media that&amp;#8217;s hard to fathom?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Is it that the metrics aren&amp;#8217;t obvious? *What are you measuring now that suggests you shouldn&amp;#8217;t waste time looking for new opportunities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is it that the concept of earning attention instead of vying for it is too foreign?&lt;/em&gt; What gets &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; attention? What do &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; notice, remember, participate in, act on or share? Does the stuff you seek out stick with you better than the stuff you come across randomly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Per Malcolm Gladwell&amp;#8217;s suggestion, I&amp;#8217;ve spent my 10,000 hours assessing the value and influence of the strategic use of Social Media and I explain to the folks who&amp;#8217;ll listen that there are better opportunities for getting at their goals through engagement than there have been for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We haven&amp;#8217;t seen a cultural shift in the way people are being influenced by media of this order since the advent of the printing press. You can reach more people more easily who are actually interested in what you&amp;#8217;re offering. Moreover–*they can reach out to you! *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d like to be proven wrong on this, but I&amp;#8217;m left with the conclusion that anyone not working on a plan to use the web as a strategic resource to power their mission:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Seriously lacks vision or imagination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Is avoiding leadership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Is squeezing the juice out of an existing play while they can&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business, markets, public sentiment, and the way we&amp;#8217;re being influenced are mutable factors. They require a flexible approach to marketing that builds a foundation and grows slowly, over the long term. Invest in your marketing wisely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you don&amp;#8217;t have to investigate something new every day, how about just the revolutionary stuff?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;smemon87&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/18090920@N07/4420336383/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Once upon a time, I thought I wanted to be a PR professional. I suited up and went for an interview at&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.humber.ca/program/04561&quot;&gt; Humber College&amp;#8217;s Public Relations &lt;/a&gt; program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first interview question was &amp;#8220;did you bring a resume?&amp;#8221; I realized I had failed the first PR interview test. I didn&amp;#8217;t have all the necessary documentation with me. Bad PR girl. Bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought the next best thing would be to fax my resume over the moment I got home. Seemed like a good PR professional-type thing to do. Moments after I faxed it, I took a big gulp and realized that the resume I had sent looked like a dog&amp;#8217;s breakfast&amp;#8211;bullets everywhere, boo-boos galore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I waved goodbye to my PR career (thank goodness).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.1667px;&quot;&gt;The impulse to act quickly without sufficient contemplation doesn&amp;#8217;t serve me well in print. But it turns out, it makes me a better blogger. My &amp;#8220;just get it done&amp;#8221; approach means that I actually publish blog posts. I don&amp;#8217;t just think about them, I don&amp;#8217;t write drafts and save them and contemplate. I hit the publish button and put the good-word &amp;#8220;out there.&amp;#8221; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, sometimes I make grammatical errors or things don&amp;#8217;t work quite the way I&amp;#8217;d hoped. But, I believe my approach is better than any other because at least people get to read my posts. They live in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, I&amp;#8217;ve come up with some tricks for how to be a prolific blogger without making myself, or&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/about-us&quot;&gt; Hypenotic&lt;/a&gt; look bad:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Schedule time to blog: *&lt;/em&gt;Make a commitment and block off the time in your calendar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not extra: *&lt;/em&gt;You can&amp;#8217;t think of it as something you&amp;#8217;ll get around to when you have some free time. Blogging is part of your job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Keep Notes: *&lt;/em&gt;You&amp;#8217;d be amazed how quickly a good idea for a blog post can evaporate from your memory bank. I&amp;#8217;m convinced some of my best blog posts have been the victim of memory failure. Keep a notebook and jot down ideas as they come.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Look Around: *&lt;/em&gt;Inspiration is everywhere. The more stuff you expose yourself to, the more content you&amp;#8217;ll come up with. That&amp;#8217;s why magazines and movies are write-off&amp;#8217;s, they&amp;#8217;re there to inspire you. Even indirectly. At the very least, set up a really good &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/reader/view/#welcome-page&quot;&gt;google reader &lt;/a&gt;and update it regularly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Mix it Up: *&lt;/em&gt;Not every post has to be a dissertation on a subject. Give yourself permission to write some really short blog posts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Hit Publish: *&lt;/em&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t overthink it. Don&amp;#8217;t save it as a draft for further (and further) contemplation. Just publish your post. If you want to amend it, you can do that later. If you want to add to it, you can write another post as a variation of the same topic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Have Other People Read and Edit your Work: *&lt;/em&gt;We have a policy around the office. I ask people to read my blog posts. If they see a boo-boo, I ask them to just go in and change it. They don&amp;#8217;t need to point out my mistakes (who likes that anyway?). So, my work is perfected when I&amp;#8217;m not even looking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What tips do you have to getting down to the business of blogging?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Social Media ROI: The Squirrel Method</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/social-media-roi-the-squirrel-method/"/>
   <updated>2010-09-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/social-media-roi-the-squirrel-method</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently, during a pleasant summer morning cuddled up with my daughters watching a gripping episode of Avatar, the Last Airbender, something caught my eye. It&amp;#8217;s hard to do that during Avatar. But, senses aroused, I trained my eye on the mirror in my living room and saw it. There was a squirrel in the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Squirrel intruder&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/86292040@N00/504253255/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/204/504253255_7262b16887.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Squirrel intruder&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Attribution License&quot; href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/photo-dropper/images/cc.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Creative Commons License&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.photodropper.com/photos/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;photo&lt;/a&gt; credit: &lt;a title=&quot;robertpaulyoung&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/86292040@N00/504253255/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;robertpaulyoung&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My three year old had left the back door open and was about to be entertained by an hour&amp;#8217;s worth of effort to get the squirrel out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the hour, we left Jodi with the scared bushy-tailed fellow now clinging to a window moulding and went out for ice-cream.We tried opening the doors and disappearing upstairs. We tried whistling, coaxing, and googling. To no avail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And she got him out. By leaving a trail of peanut butter drops out the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flash forward to Monday morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over a breakfast meeting, I was being asked the usual hard questions about Social Media ROI. How do I quantify the return? How do I qualify the investment?  I counter-grilled by trying to get at what magical metrics they were getting from what they were doing previously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from announcing a sale one day and asking the people who show up where they heard about the event, it&amp;#8217;s pretty hard to quantify your ROI. Most of us do business with brands we trust. But I doubt those brands factor what it took for them to be perceived as trustworthy (employees with a good upbringing? delivering on time? clear communications?) into their calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the meeting, I had successfully transformed the entrepreneur&amp;#8217;s perspective on the benefits of planning to use the web strategically before jumping at tactics. He felt comfortable articulating to his partners the value of earning the attention of more qualified leads and building relationships with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we were leaving, an analogy struck me. Not that your prospects are squirrels, but when you earn their attention with something they&amp;#8217;re interested in, lead them where you want them to go, and back off on the hard sell, you end up with a process where everyone wins.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Terroni’s Brand Takes No Prisoners</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/terronis-brand-takes-no-prisoners/"/>
   <updated>2010-08-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/terronis-brand-takes-no-prisoners</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2778&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/?attachment_id=2778&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2778&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-08-26 at 4.11.57 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-26-at-4.11.57-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;310&quot; height=&quot;440&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Servers at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.terroni.ca/&quot;&gt;Terroni &lt;/a&gt;won&amp;#8217;t sprinkle cheese on your Spaghetti Canna a Mare (with Seafood), and that&amp;#8217;s a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stances like this one, and others (no cutting pizza, no butter on bread) stir up a lot of controversy. But Terroni takes a position on their brand, and they fervently protect it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.copyblogger.com/courageous-blogging/&quot;&gt;Copyblogger &lt;/a&gt;writer Brian Clark believes you must have courage to be a leader:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need the courage to alienate the wrong people in order to resonate with the right people. You need to stick to your convictions when people tell you you’re wrong simply because your knowledge doesn’t mesh with their opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of &amp;#8220;protecting your brand&amp;#8221; may conjure up images of people sitting around board rooms discussing the minutia of whether a particular shade of red is consistent with the brand &amp;#8220;identity&amp;#8221;. This is not what I&amp;#8217;m talking about. And this is not what I imagine Terroni does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brands that stand for something, like Terroni, operate from a gut level. Terroni&amp;#8217;s mission in life is to use, make and share authentic Southern Italian food. Authenticity is baked into everything they do. Just like you know which clothing styles suit you and which don&amp;#8217;t, good brands just know what &amp;#8216;fits&amp;#8217; with who they are and what they believe in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2796&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/branding/2782/terronis-brand-takes-no-prisoners/attachment/screen-shot-2010-08-26-at-7-37-48-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2796&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-08-26 at 7.37.48 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-26-at-7.37.48-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;221&quot; height=&quot;169&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;So, when a relative of Terroni&amp;#8217;s owner came back from Italy with a brightly patterned, highly textured bag made by Italian women inmates , they got in touch and started carrying &lt;a href=&quot;http://translate.google.ca/translate?hl=en&amp;amp;sl=it&amp;amp;u=http://www.madeincarcere.it/&amp;amp;ei=7s92TKjwPIy2ngfet7mdCw&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=translate&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=1&amp;amp;ved=0CBwQ7gEwAA&amp;amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dmade%2Bin%2Bcarcere%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dsafari%26rls%3Den%26prmd%3Di&quot;&gt;Made In Carcere &lt;/a&gt;(Made in Prison) bags printed with the Terroni moniker. The bags and accessories are proudly displayed at Terroni restaurants right alongside the olive oil and tomato sauce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bags are recycled so they simultaneously give a &amp;#8220;second chance&amp;#8221; to the fabric they&amp;#8217;re made from and the women who manufacture them. The accessories all come from scraps left behind by  high end Italian fashion houses such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.costumenational.com/&quot;&gt;Costume National.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terroni&amp;#8217;s co-owner Vince describes the look as &amp;#8220;very Italian&amp;#8221; which for him probably means &amp;#8220;Southern Italian.&amp;#8221; The South has the Mediterranean sea where one can imagine the perfect beach-side setting for a lovely yellow and white polka dot bag. It just fits with olives, capers, anchovies and all of the affordable, fabulous ingredients that define Southern Italian cooking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2779&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/?attachment_id=2779&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2779&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-08-26 at 4.57.22 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-26-at-4.57.22-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;298&quot; height=&quot;215&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;If I&amp;#8217;m waxing a bit poetic it&amp;#8217;s because that&amp;#8217;s the effect that Terroni&amp;#8217;s simple, Southern Italian Food has on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, it&amp;#8217;s not just Terroni&amp;#8217;s food. I&amp;#8217;m always happy to eat at Terroni, and I can&amp;#8217;t say that about many places (especially not &amp;#8216;chains&amp;#8217;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the food,  I often look longingly at all the products that line their shelves. Their hot peppers in oil kick some ass. As a product extention, the In Carcene bags and accessories really round out the Southern Italian feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fact is, a brand well executed conjures feelings and creates a story&amp;#8211;even if it&amp;#8217;s a story or a feeling about someplace you&amp;#8217;ve never been. Like I&amp;#8217;ve never been to an Italian prison, but man, this headband makes me feel like Anna Magnani in *&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051986/&quot;&gt;Nella città l&amp;#8217;inferno&lt;/a&gt;. *It carries a mystique that it just wouldn&amp;#8217;t have if I bought it at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lululemon.com/&quot;&gt;Lululemon. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can tell Terroni gets it because they deliver these feelings with every plate of pizza and pasta and with my brand new headband. So, let the whiners keep whining and call Terroni&amp;#8217;s careful choices &lt;a href=&quot;http://torontoist.com/2008/08/terroni_abhors_your_unsophisticated_palate.php&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;unjustifiable pretentiousness.&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; I call it being on a mission and maintaining focus and love for the brand and avoiding distractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, special props to my dad for taking the pictures. Great job dad!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>All Hail the Class Clown</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/all-hail-the-class-clown/"/>
   <updated>2010-08-25T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/all-hail-the-class-clown</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2755&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaningfulmarketing/2752/all-hail-the-class-clown/attachment/screen-shot-2010-08-25-at-1-28-34-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2755&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-08-25 at 1.28.34 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-25-at-1.28.34-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;246&quot; height=&quot;342&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Just wrapped a meeting with Philip Playfair and Steve Hammond, the Co-Founders of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lowfoot.com/&quot;&gt;Lowfoot. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lowfoot.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Lowfoot&amp;#8217;s business is based on disruptive thinking, and I&amp;#8217;m convinced they&amp;#8217;ve got it right. They&amp;#8217;ve uncovered the fact that while everyone&amp;#8217;s busy figuring out new ways (some green, some not) to meet our ever growing energy needs, no one is really, &lt;em&gt;seriously&lt;/em&gt; asking how to build a business on getting people to generate less energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#8217;s what they&amp;#8217;ve done. &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.1667px;&quot;&gt;Lowfoot has staked its business on the power of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_meter&quot;&gt;Smart Meter technology &lt;/a&gt;to empower people to reduce their demand for energy and reap rewards (in the form of credits) from using less.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meetings with these guys are always interesting. They have an &amp;#8220;anything is possible&amp;#8221; way of thinking that is exciting to be around. One of the insights I gained from today&amp;#8217;s meeting is that both Phil and Steve are former class clowns (well, maybe not so former).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term class clown is generally seen in a negative light. Class clowns are perceived as attention seekers, troubled kids who are using humour to make up for deep-seated insecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you met Phil and Steve, you&amp;#8217;d know that stereotype is pure bunk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I went digging deeper and came up with two very interesting approaches to thinking about the class clown as a model for business innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14.1667px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.copyblogger.com/how-to-stop-being-invisible/&quot;&gt;Copyblogger has a great post &lt;/a&gt;on why class clowns rule the blogosphere. &lt;/span&gt;The author&amp;#8217;s salient point is that while:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;valedictorians are forgotten the moment they step down from the podium,&amp;#8221; class clowns are remembered for &amp;#8220;telling the truth in an interesting way&amp;#8221;and as a result, they are remembered long after school days have drifted by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea of telling the truth in an interesting way fits with Lowfoot&amp;#8217;s business model. Lowfoot is committed to turning people into energy generators. They are not afraid to speak truth to power by pointing out that all forms of energy generation (wind, solar, &amp;#8220;green&amp;#8221;) come at a cost. Just ask the &lt;a href=&quot;http://savethebalafalls.com/&quot;&gt;folks in Bala &lt;/a&gt;who are facing a &amp;#8220;green&amp;#8221; dam being built in the centre of their town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Lowfoot, class clowns are good at getting noticed because they&amp;#8217;re not invested in the same popularity/unpopularity contests that everyone else is mired in. Fitting in is just not their specialty. Former class clown &lt;a href=&quot;http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DTI/is_11_33/ai_n15777260/&quot;&gt;CEO David Newman&lt;/a&gt; does a good job of explaining the skill set that is unique to the class clown:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Think about it&amp;#8211;class clowns, by their very nature, are not afraid to fail, unlike the geniuses. They thrive on being different, unlike the geeks, who suffer by being different. They focus on getting noticed among the noise, unlike the cool kids, who focus on fitting in.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s something the class clown can teach you about running a successful business? Or even better, what&amp;#8217;s a class clown antic you&amp;#8217;ll never forget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, in honor of my new favourite class clowns, I leave you with this:&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Missing the Boat on Brand Ambassadors</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/missing-the-boat-on-brand-ambassadors/"/>
   <updated>2010-08-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/missing-the-boat-on-brand-ambassadors</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2728&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/branding/2724/missing-the-boat-on-brand-ambassadors/attachment/img_0409&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-large wp-image-2728&quot; title=&quot;IMG_0409&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/IMG_0409-1024x1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;614&quot; height=&quot;614&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every employee in your organization is in the marketing department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means that no matter how much money you spend on advertising (or social media, PR, direct mail, etc.) your employees&amp;#8217; feelings about where they work creates &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; most significant impression on consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/09/what-advertisin.html&quot;&gt;Seth Godin points out, &lt;/a&gt;if you&amp;#8217;ve ever walked into an &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.apple.com/ca&quot;&gt;Apple Store&lt;/a&gt; you&amp;#8217;ll know what I mean. I think I have a crush on every single guy who works there. Helpfulness is so sexy. But I digress&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just spent some time in Muskoka at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.touchstoneonlakemuskoka.com/&quot;&gt;Touchstone Resort. &lt;/a&gt;To put it plainly, Touchstone is a fancy place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does fancy mean? Well, there&amp;#8217;s a guy who comes and grooms the beach daily, a gym, salt water pool, daily housekeeping* and* (get this) call and book ahead and someone will come to build a fire for you right at the beach. THEY BUILD YOU A FIRE. Amazing, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you get that this is not typical cottage living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Touchstone also sells cottages&amp;#8211;whole cottages or fractional ownership. And, while I didn&amp;#8217;t experience any heavy handed salesy stuff, I did notice that they offer a free&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.touchstoneonlakemuskoka.com/daycation.html&quot;&gt; &amp;#8216;Daycation&amp;#8217; visit&lt;/a&gt; to anyone interested in having a look around the place.  Make no mistake about it, they want to make a favourable impression on those who visit because they want you to buy.&amp;lt;!--more--&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it came to creating favourable impressions, Trevor, the lovely gentleman who took  my kids, my parents and us on a pontoon  tour  of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Muskoka&quot;&gt;Lake Muskoka &lt;/a&gt;took the prize. He was a genuine, decent, friendly guy. When we asked, he  told us about the resort&amp;#8211;how the fractional ownership thing worked, how the resort was doing, the developers behind the place. He glowed with enthusiasm and pride. He&amp;#8217;s a teacher in during the year, riding the boat and landscaping the resort are his part time gigs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there was the experience with management. My folks( who admittedly love their air conditioning) had very little cool air flow in the master bedroom. They weren&amp;#8217;t just being neurotic. I can verify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were paying the tab for the place and they wanted someone to come check it out. Someone did check it out and left claiming that something was wrong with the ductwork and they&amp;#8217;d need to call in some backup. That was the last we heard from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My folks called and left three messages for management. No response. Now, I&amp;#8217;m not saying my folks aren&amp;#8217;t somewhat high maintenance. But that aside, no one returned their calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what did Touchstone teach me about brand ambassadors?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trevor was the ideal brand ambassador for Touchstone. When you&amp;#8217;re trapped on a pontoon for an hour, there&amp;#8217;s lots of time for conversation. And, if the conversation drifts to the benefits of buying at Touchstone then all the better. Especially coming from a guy like that. If that was deliberate on Touchstone&amp;#8217;s part then I say  &amp;#8220;good on em!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the radio silence from Management created an entirely different impression. What does it say when no one answers your call. We&amp;#8217;ve all been in this spot and know it&amp;#8217;s unsettling. In the case of Touchstone it says you probably shouldn&amp;#8217;t buy a place there. It says nobody at the top is accessible and no body cares. It&amp;#8217;s a take the money and run situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me, when it comes to creating employee ambassadors Touchstone has half the equation figured out. It&amp;#8217;s ass backwards from how most places do it&amp;#8211;friendly, helpful management but crap on the ground people. But the result is the same. An inconsistent brand experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when that brand is a premium brand like Touchstone, every impression matters.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Running with Cancer</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/running-with-cancer/"/>
   <updated>2010-08-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/running-with-cancer</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In April my friend Leanne Coppen died of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HER2/neu&quot;&gt;Her2&lt;/a&gt; breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was only 38 and had been diagnosed only 2 years earlier. She did the 60K &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.endcancer.ca/&quot;&gt;Weekend to End Women&amp;#8217;s Cancers&lt;/a&gt; after her cancer had metastasized.  That&amp;#8217;s a long way for anyone to walk. But for someone who had been through over a year of treatment, it&amp;#8217;s downright incredible.  Here&amp;#8217;s a short video of Leanne&amp;#8217;s walk last year that was part of the orientation materials &lt;a href=&quot;http://to10.endcancer.ca/site/PageServer?pagename=10_aboutevent&quot;&gt;Princess Margaret&lt;/a&gt; makes available online:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;#8217;s put all that sad stuff behind us for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leanne was an amazing writer who blogged about Living with Breast Cancer for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.chatelaine.com/english/index.jsp&quot;&gt;Chatelaine magazine&lt;/a&gt;. I was recently reading her blog posts and stumbled upon a post where she wrote about going for a run in the midst of her treatment cycle. If you want to be blown away by a woman you never had the pleasure of meeting &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.en.chatelaine.com/living-with-http://blog.en.chatelaine.com/living-with-breast-cancer/when-she-says-10-minutes-she-means-it/&quot;&gt;read the post here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was the ideal poster child for my upcoming Walk to End Women&amp;#8217; Cancers. Because I&amp;#8217;m a big wimp, I&amp;#8217;ll only be walking 32K in one day, not the 60K she walked over the course of a weekend last year. If it wasn&amp;#8217;t for her, I wouldn&amp;#8217;t be walking at all, I&amp;#8217;d be sitting on my couch &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/jodilastman&quot;&gt;Tweeting &lt;/a&gt;or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.laineygossip.com/&quot;&gt;something. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first started talking to people about doing the walk I envisioned I would start walking and then not stop for like a really, really long time. Kinda like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109830/&quot;&gt;Forest Gump&lt;/a&gt;. Then people started asking, &amp;#8220;are you training?&amp;#8221; and warning &amp;#8220;that&amp;#8217;s a long walk you know.&amp;#8221; The kind people at work even mapped it and then told me that it was like walking to York Mills and back downtown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first I was taken aback. I signed up for a class at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.runningroom.com/hm/&quot;&gt;Running Room&lt;/a&gt;, bought new shoes, and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.runningroom.com/hm/inside.php?id=2584&quot;&gt;book on walking&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ve been trying to walk regularly as I head towards the big day on September 11th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But more than anything that damn blog post has kept me motivated. How could a woman who had endured rounds upon rounds of gruelling cancer treatment walk 60K and train while neck deep in shit? Well she did. And frankly she did it with a smile. And so healthy, lucky me is totally confident that I can do a measly 32K with a smile firmly planted on my face too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, if you can&amp;#8217;t walk, I&amp;#8217;m pretty confident you can donate. I know that&amp;#8217;s pushy. But hell, I&amp;#8217;m going to be pushy about this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve received letters about The Weekend before and frankly ignored them. But now I know better. And so do you.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>7 tips for writing useful (and usable) web content</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/getting-your-writing-read/"/>
   <updated>2010-08-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/getting-your-writing-read</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My friend Brian is an aeronautical engineer. Several years ago, he explained to me that most things designed for people with disabilities are more accessible for people without disabilities too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds obvious in hindsight, but if you set out to make what you&amp;#8217;re doing as usable as it can be, you give it the best chance of being used by the most people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a lesson here in writing for the web, where you&amp;#8217;re not only writing for the most impatient audience you&amp;#8217;ll ever meet, but also for search engines, who–while amazing bits of technology, can&amp;#8217;t quite compete with the human brain for processing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/magazine/20Computer-t.html&quot;&gt;certain types of information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This (much watched) video with comedian Louis CK hilariously illustrates our lack of reverence for the wonders of our digital era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s no disputing that writing for the web is its own beast. When writing for readers you have to contend with a profound lack of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.useit.com/alertbox/991128.html&quot;&gt;patience&lt;/a&gt;. You can&amp;#8217;t delay gratification, you have to serve it up quickly and heartily. The bonus is that if you optimize your content for readers you&amp;#8217;ll also be rewarded by search engines. Search engines are measured by how useful the content they serve up is, and, accordingly, are designed to let the best presented content rise to the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no shortage of places to find proven tips on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.useit.com/papers/webwriting/&quot;&gt;writing for the web&lt;/a&gt;. Here are some notes I dashed off for a client recently in response to a random post I chose from their site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Use media&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s nothing like a video or an image to draw people in. You can use multiple images if it helps. Think of yourself as an editor for a hot magazine–the better this article is curated, the more likely it will be to be read and shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Use links&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Link out to the organizations, profiles and references you mention. If you can send readers out to useful info/resources, you increase the chances of them coming back to us. It&amp;#8217;s social (courteous)–you&amp;#8217;d be tickled to have someone else point to your posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Use &amp;#8220;Block Quotes&amp;#8221;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make it easier for readers to approach your writing by employing the visual interestingness afforded by layout elements like block quotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also help us see important thoughts or quotes at a glance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Chunk your text&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People don&amp;#8217;t read online like they do in print–they scan. Knowing this gives us an opportunity to make it easier on them by writing for scanning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One great way to do this is to make sure paragraphs don&amp;#8217;t contain more than a single thought/idea. They can have multiple sentences, as long as you lead with the point, with ensuing sentences adding depth for interested readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This practice is useful because uninterested readers will simply skip to the next section (typically next paragraph).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Subheads&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking the last point further, it&amp;#8217;s considered good practice on longer posts to use subheads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scanners can skip to the sections that interest them and search engines weigh subheads more heavily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Voice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having an opinion is an important part of building relationships with readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reporting is great, but it should be in the context of an issue we&amp;#8217;re framing. It&amp;#8217;s important because there are a lot of places that report, but few in a position to have an opinion. Opinions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  endear some towards you, increasing the likelihood of being shared.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  polarize others, creating an opinion where there was none before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  can inflame still others. And there&amp;#8217;s nothing like controversy for getting attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try to do all three if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ask for feedback&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they say in the lotto, &amp;#8220;You have to play to win&amp;#8221;, and if you don&amp;#8217;t ask for comments, especially at the beginning, you shouldn&amp;#8217;t expect to get any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have any thoughts on improving posts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you point us at anyone who engages you, whether they use these tips or others?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course it sucks that this needs to exist. And I know it&amp;#8217;s a joke, but it does. Until people learn to stop writing copy that says &amp;#8220;we&amp;#8221; instead of &amp;#8220;you&amp;#8221;, and until people stop using twitter to have private conversations publicly, we need reminders that the era of talking at people is over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jargon doesn&amp;#8217;t make you more credible, it makes you more suspect.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Shut Up and Let Me Go!</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2674&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/branding/2672/shut-up-and-let-me-go/attachment/screen-shot-2010-08-10-at-12-08-46-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2674&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-08-10 at 12.08.46 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-10-at-12.08.46-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;314&quot; height=&quot;293&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Had a fun run-in with a day camp staffer who informed me that I would not be able to receive a refund for a camp position my daughter would no longer need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#8217;t charged an administrative fee to cover the costs of filling the position again (there&amp;#8217;s a waiting list). This was a punitive slap on the arse no money back guarantee. Let me repeat. No. Money. Back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this from a camp that sent my daughter home with the lyrics to the song &amp;#8216;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.gol.com/users/quakers/simple_gifts.htm&quot;&gt;Simple Gifts&amp;#8217;&lt;/a&gt; hand scrawled on a scrap of paper because a dear, sweet counsellor overheard her singing it and encouraged her to share it with the group (sniff).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The camp is behaving like cell phone companies who have contracts that protect *their *interests with little thought for what would serve their customers best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, some notable companies have incredibly simple exit plans that make it virtually seamless for you to go elsewhere. One shining example is the online billing service &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freshbooks.com/&quot;&gt;Freshbooks. &lt;/a&gt;Freshbooks lives up to its tagline &amp;#8220;Painless Billing&amp;#8221; by allowing you to leave, or downgrade your account with no questions asked. No one will ask you why you&amp;#8217;re leaving or negotiate to get you to stay. You simply click a a button and off you go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another notable example is the small  business software company&lt;a href=&quot;http://37signals.com/&quot;&gt; 37 Signals. &lt;/a&gt;Their philosophy is based on letting their customers outgrow them. In their book &lt;a href=&quot;http://37signals.com/rework/&quot;&gt;Rework&lt;/a&gt;, the company&amp;#8217;s founders Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson say that they realize they can&amp;#8217;t be all things to all people, and that when some companies &amp;#8220;grow up&amp;#8221; they&amp;#8217;ll move on to other software companies. In short &amp;#8220;Scaring away new customers is worse than losing old customers.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;#8217;re willing to let customers exit without pain and suffering you&amp;#8217;re saying several important things about your brand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  You are thinking about your customers&amp;#8217; needs over your own&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  You know who you are and who you aren&amp;#8217;t&amp;#8211;and that what you&amp;#8217;re offering isn&amp;#8217;t for everyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  You aren&amp;#8217;t just being punitive. Sure there may be costs when someone goes. And it&amp;#8217;s fair to pass those on. But, don&amp;#8217;t just do it because you&amp;#8217;re angry and want to punish somebody&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  You&amp;#8217;re confident in your own abilities. You don&amp;#8217;t need to force me to love you, I&amp;#8217;m going to love you just because you&amp;#8217;re so great at doing what you do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  You want me to pass you on. I may not want to use you anymore, but that doesn&amp;#8217;t mean we can&amp;#8217;t still be friends and I can&amp;#8217;t say really nice things about you to other people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#8217;s not make this whole breakup thing so painful. There are lots of reasons why people have to move on. Some of them very innocuous. So let&amp;#8217;s part on happy terms, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and can I have my jeans back?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>I’m Gonna Wash That Brand…</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/2649/"/>
   <updated>2010-08-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/2649</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I go to the bathroom in restaurants, I often think about the soap. &lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2661&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/branding/2649/2649/attachment/screen-shot-2010-08-05-at-3-22-28-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2661&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-08-05 at 3.22.28 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-05-at-3.22.28-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;296&quot; height=&quot;241&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The soap has become a fixation for me because I always ask myself: did they or didn&amp;#8217;t they refill the expensive-brand soap dispenser with cheap soap?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I see a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.methodhome.com/&quot;&gt;Method&lt;/a&gt; dispenser, the series of questions begins:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do they really use Method soap?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many people wash their hands here? That&amp;#8217;s expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s probably not Method. Wait, let me smell it. I don&amp;#8217;t think so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why don&amp;#8217;t they just put the cheaper brand in here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I feel about this fraud?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do I care?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why am I such a victim of branding?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The soap becomes a distraction from the dining experience and my perception of the restaurant. Truth is, they&amp;#8217;d be better to either use a generic (so as to be invisible) soap dispenser, or something totally unique (in order to say something about themselves.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2651&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/branding/2649/2649/attachment/screen-shot-2010-08-05-at-2-57-54-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2651&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-08-05 at 2.57.54 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-05-at-2.57.54-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;376&quot; height=&quot;467&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Herein lies the trouble with Jennifer Aniston&amp;#8217;s celebrity endorsement of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.glaceau.com/&quot;&gt;Smart Water&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like soap, water is a parity product. Whatever it&amp;#8217;s called, it more or less does the job. Drawing attention to the whole branding game thus becomes a big-hairy distraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one loathes Jennifer Aniston more than Canada&amp;#8217;s own &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.laineygossip.com&quot;&gt;Laineygossip.com&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, Lainey&amp;#8217;s most recent rant on Aniston sums up the problem with her endorsement of Smart Water. I&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this month&amp;#8217;s issue of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/fashion-articles/jennifer-aniston-barbra-streisand-pictures-0910&quot;&gt;Harper&amp;#8217;s Bazzar&lt;/a&gt; Aniston pays homage to Barbara Steisand in a photo shoot. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.laineygossip.com/Jennifer_Aniston_as_Barbra_Streisand_Harpers_Bazaar_04aug10.aspx?CatID=0&amp;amp;CelID=67&quot;&gt;Lainey&amp;#8217;s response is swift and harsh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.laineygossip.com/Jennifer_Aniston_as_Barbra_Streisand_Harpers_Bazaar_04aug10.aspx?CatID=0&amp;amp;CelID=67&quot;&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; and then she has a moment of self-reflection:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So would Streisand make movies like *The Bounty Hunter *over and over and over again? Movies that depict women one dimensionally who can only be fulfilled by a man and love?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You ask me why I’m hard on Jennifer Aniston. I’m hard on her because the game she sells sounds so good but the game she actually plays is the worst fraud there is. Jennifer Aniston is not an example. Jennifer Aniston is what we shouldn’t. And Jennifer Aniston is certainly NOT Barbra Streisand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this my friends is precisely why Smart Water made a big, huge mistep in casting Jennifer Aniston as it&amp;#8217;s spokesmodel. Using an actor who &amp;#8220;sounds so good&amp;#8230;but the game she actually plays is the worst fraud ever&amp;#8221; thrusts me back into  the mindset of the soap conundrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fraud of Jennifer Aniston highlights the fraud of selling water, of branding, of all that&amp;#8217;s good and right with the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the more her abs look like a washboard, the more distracted I become (how much does she work out? what does her life look like?&amp;#8230;) And I&amp;#8217;m not alone. As soon as the ad was published, folks started speculating about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/18/jennifer-aniston-bares-ri_n_580319.html&quot;&gt;Aniston&amp;#8217;s diet. &lt;/a&gt;And, others have used the absurdity of Aniston&amp;#8217;s endorsement to highlight more important issues, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/18/jennifer-aniston-bares-ri_n_580319.html&quot;&gt;lack of  access to clean water.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you can choose to be great or choose be invisible. If you land somewhere in the middle you risk drawing attention to the effort&amp;#8211;which really defeats the purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What celebrity endorsements do you think work? Do they ever work? As &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqPiJ0L7YmY&quot;&gt;Linda Richmond&lt;/a&gt; would say,  talk among yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Beware the Cosmic Spiral</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/beware-the-cosmic-spiral/"/>
   <updated>2010-08-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/beware-the-cosmic-spiral</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2626&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/branding/2609/beware-the-cosmic-spiral/attachment/screen-shot-2010-08-03-at-4-52-55-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2626&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-08-03 at 4.52.55 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-03-at-4.52.55-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;326&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We&amp;#8217;d like to interrupt the noise in your head to inform you that *you are not your audience. *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**The concept is simple, and yet very smart people forget to remove their heads from their navels (or worse places) to look around and consider what their audience might look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being in this business, I&amp;#8217;m often engaged in casual conversations with people about marketing. Sitting pond-side on a vacation recently, a talented expressive-arts therapy instructor wanted to discuss names for her business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was hard to maintain a professional demeanor when she told me the name she was considering was *Cosmic Spiral. *Granted, when you research its meaning, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zenzibar.com/cosmicspiral/cosmicspiral.htm&quot;&gt;Cosmic Spiral &lt;/a&gt;is a compelling term that has existed in a gazillion cultures for a gazillion years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, if you didn&amp;#8217;t know that, the name Cosmic Spiral would mean just one thing; &amp;#8220;You are a crazy woo-woo fanatic and your business is way too &amp;#8216;out there&amp;#8217; for me.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #444444; font-style: normal; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px;&quot;&gt;My first question to her was, &amp;#8220;well, do you want to attract people just like you?&amp;#8221; She is a woman I respect, and I&amp;#8217;ve participated in her programs. But I consider myself a pretty mainstream gal. Start talking cosmic spirals and I&amp;#8217;m running for the door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #444444; font-style: normal; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px;&quot;&gt;This is an extreme example of a rather common problem. People don&amp;#8217;t get out of their own heads to consider who their audiences may be and what they need to hear and see to feel like they are part of the message.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Saturday&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/all-inclusive-packages-geared-toward-the-neophyte-camper/article1658356/&quot;&gt;The Globe and Mail &lt;/a&gt;there was a fascinating article about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ontarioparks.com/&quot;&gt;Ontario Parks&amp;#8217;&lt;/a&gt; move to reach out to Ontario&amp;#8217;s newcomers with culturally relevant information and workshops on the joys of camping. A 22% drop in camping participation lead Ontario Parks to undertake focus groups and&lt;em&gt;, voila&lt;/em&gt;, Ontario Parks identifies a huge potential audience that has been alienated by their current marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year between &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ontarioimmigration.ca/stdprodconsume/groups/csc/@oipp/documents/document/oi_arr_ont_imm_cat_table.pdf&quot;&gt;2002 and 2007 &lt;/a&gt;an average of&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ontarioimmigration.ca/stdprodconsume/groups/csc/@oipp/documents/document/oi_arr_ont_imm_cat_table.pdf&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;over 126,000 newcomers arrived in Ontario and no one was helping them get excited about camping. I find that pretty amazing. But then again not surprising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, two Toronto based businesses have taken a proactive approach to audiences by thinking beyond demographics (age, gender, income, education), and instead thinking about communities of interest&amp;#8211;specifically about people who use bikes to get around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biking as a form of transportation is on the rise. What do urban bikers look like? A little gut-work will tell you they are a socially engaged, values-minded, educated bunch who tend to be independent thinkers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2617&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/branding/2609/beware-the-cosmic-spiral/attachment/screen-shot-2010-08-03-at-4-45-53-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2617&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-08-03 at 4.45.53 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-03-at-4.45.53-PM-250x250.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It then makes perfect sense that two values based independently-minded businesses that wanted to stand out decided to talk to bikers. Dufflet, a high end dessert company, ran &lt;a href=&quot;http://tourdedufflet.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Tour De Dufflet&lt;/a&gt; throughout the month of June in celebration of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogto.com/city/2008/05/bike_month_in_toronto/&quot;&gt;Bike Month&lt;/a&gt;. Participants who biked to all 3 Dufflet cafes in one day received a souvenir water bottle, refreshments and other goodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.typebooks.ca/&quot;&gt;Type Books&lt;/a&gt; has also forged a connection between their indie book stores and indie culture inherent in biking. Type has partnered with Bike Sauce, a new DIY bike repair space and community hub. &lt;a href=&quot;http://bikesauce.org/&quot;&gt;Bike Sauce&lt;/a&gt; wanted to offer cyclists a resource library on all things bike related. They approached Type, who did all of the digging to find the most relevant books, and sold them to Bike Sauce at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of seeing yourself as the audience, or thinking in terms of demographics, consider what communities of interest could engage in what your business has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Who besides you, and people like you, cares about what you&amp;#8217;re doing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  What unique features do you have that could be important to others (quick= moms, escapist=professionals, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Where do those people go for information? How should you speak to them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Who can you partner with to create meaningful linkages that don&amp;#8217;t already exist?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, avoid the cosmic spiral. It may be ancient. It may be beautiful. But man, it&amp;#8217;s a long, strange trip.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Asbestos and Ice Cream</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/asbestos-and-ice-cream/"/>
   <updated>2010-07-25T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/asbestos-and-ice-cream</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2581&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/2567/asbestos-and-ice-cream/attachment/nellie&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Nellie&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Nellie.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;246&quot; height=&quot;306&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2581&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/2567/asbestos-and-ice-cream/attachment/nellie&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Before the age of the internet&amp;#8211;well, before  age of the television, how companies treated their employees was largely a matter between the employee and the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently heard a BBC radio program about a young woman named &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nellie_Kershaw&quot;&gt;Nellie Kershaw&lt;/a&gt; who, in the 1920&amp;#8242;s suffered the first documented case of asbestos poisoning while working at &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_%26_Newall&quot;&gt;Turner Brothers Asbestos&lt;/a&gt; in Manchester, UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unable to work, Nellie corresponded with Turner Brothers requesting sickness benefits, she asked:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What are you going to do about my case? I have been home 9 weeks now and have not received a penny &amp;#8211; I think it&amp;#8217;s time that there was something from you as the National Health refuses to pay me anything. I am needing nourishment and the money, I should have had 9 weeks wages now through no fault of my own.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nellie was flat-out refused any form of compensation because asbestos poisoning was not a recognized occupational disease at that time. Nellie died in her early 30&amp;#8242;s and was buried in an unmarked grave because when Nellie&amp;#8217;s husband asked Turner Brothers for help in paying for funeral arrangements, they again refused to provide any form of compensation.&amp;lt;!--more--&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2581&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/2567/asbestos-and-ice-cream/attachment/nellie&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;History only remembers Nellie Kershaw because her case led to the implementation of the first asbestos industry regulations in 1931.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2584&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/2567/asbestos-and-ice-cream/attachment/screen-shot-2010-07-25-at-3-00-07-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2584&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-07-25 at 3.00.07 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Screen-shot-2010-07-25-at-3.00.07-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;305&quot; height=&quot;402&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Fast forward just shy of 100 years. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chapmans.ca/&quot;&gt;Chapman&amp;#8217;s Ice Cream&lt;/a&gt; factory in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestar.com/news/ontario/article/691159&quot;&gt;Markdale Ontario is destroyed by fire&lt;/a&gt;. The factory had been in the town for 35 years. At the time of the fire Markdale had a population of 1400, and 350 of it&amp;#8217;s residents worked at the factory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the fire, Chapman&amp;#8217;s owners David and Penny Chapman announced that the company would pay salaried employees in full for one year, hourly employees for four months – and he would &amp;#8220;take care of&amp;#8221; them beyond that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This decision was consistent with everything Chapman&amp;#8217;s stood for as a company. It had long supported the community at a grassroots level&amp;#8211;from supporting local baseball teams to donating large sums to the local hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I find myself staying at a cottage near Markdale nearly a year after the fire. On a ride up with a friend who has just moved from Toronto to a town near Markdale, my husband was bemoaning the poor (corporate type) ice cream available in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our friend staunchly defended Chapman&amp;#8217;s  by telling the story of the fire and how Chapman&amp;#8217;s stood up for its employees and for the town it is part of. Our friend said &amp;#8220;you&amp;#8217;ll never hear anyone in town say anything bad about Chapmans.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I happened to take the kids for a scoop of the cold stuff  at Chilli Willi&amp;#8217;s Ice Cream Parlour near Markdale.This particular parlour had to close its doors early when Chapman&amp;#8217;s closure meant ice cream shortages. The owner would not carry another supplier. She decided to wait until Chapman&amp;#8217;s was back up and running. Here, I heair a young man say how he likes the chocolate ice cream in the parlour better than the Chapman&amp;#8217;s ice cream he gets at home. I think &amp;#8220;this guy knows his Chapman&amp;#8217;s.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only does this story get lots of play in the local ice cream parlour and in and around Markdale, but the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=12&amp;amp;ved=0CBoQFjABOAo&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fviews.washingtonpost.com%2Fleadership%2Fguestinsights%2F2010%2F02%2Fjoe-frontiera-and-dan-leidl.html&amp;amp;ei=naVLTLKFIMP4nAf9zdjjDQ&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGqjP9vOdKlJTTOMHKdswvgcoYDKg&amp;amp;sig2=ZiLpMcXfsKLU4g0cRl94hw&quot;&gt;Washington Post &lt;/a&gt;wrote about the case as an example of exemplary corporate social responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against this background of cynicism about business &amp;#8212; sometimes deserved &amp;#8212; David and Penny Chapman stand out. After the fire, they could have called it a career, taking their insurance money and retiring to a warmer climate. Instead they did something all too rare in today&amp;#8217;s corporate culture &amp;#8212; they thought of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ice cream is a feel-good product; it puts smiles on children&amp;#8217;s faces. And Chapman&amp;#8217;s carried that feel-good-factor forward by supporting the folks who worked hard to make Chapman&amp;#8217;s a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People in Markdale are loyal to Chapman&amp;#8217;s ice cream. It&amp;#8217;s practically the only brand you&amp;#8217;ll see in general stores in the area. And, while I&amp;#8217;m generally resistant to &amp;#8216;big corporate&amp;#8217; entities like Chapman&amp;#8217;s and the farming practices they employ, I have to say, the impact of Chapman&amp;#8217;s gesture to employees put the sprinkles on top of their brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapman&amp;#8217;s leveraged their role as a beloved Canadian organization in the following ad where they thank Canada for supporting them while they were rebuilding their plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2581&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/2567/asbestos-and-ice-cream/attachment/nellie&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapman&amp;#8217;s has leveraged its &amp;#8220;when-bad-things-happen-to-good-people tale. But they do it without being exploitive. They have turned a tragedy into a triumph for their brand, for their employees, for the town, and finally, for Canada, who cheers on the success of the ice cream brand because it&amp;#8217;s nice, just like we are.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Apple’s secret sauce for your business</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/apples-secret-sauce-for-your-business/"/>
   <updated>2010-07-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/apples-secret-sauce-for-your-business</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-7199&quot; title=&quot;apple-sauce-good-business&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/apple-sauce-good-business.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;464&quot; /&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sure that in California this story uses a Shark, but in Toronto, there&amp;#8217;s an old joke that if you come across a bear in the woods, you don&amp;#8217;t have to out-run the bear, just your friend. As Homer (Simpson) says, &amp;#8220;it&amp;#8217;s funny &amp;#8217;cause it&amp;#8217;s true&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#8217;m finally ready to start using my ipad on the road–away from all the places I get wi-fi. I get the card from a Rogers store, plug it in, and go through the sequence to sign up for a plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a glitch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I call the number on the back of the card and Rogers starts passing me around like a considerably less-than-hot potato. That&amp;#8217;s par for the course, of course–big companies have conditioned us to repeat our story and credentials over and over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would have just put them on speaker while subjugating myself to their process, but their music made me want to get hit in head with a part blunt, part spiky medieval weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course each time it got worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They finally explained that I&amp;#8217;d need to speak to Apple and gave me the right number. Again, I was told I&amp;#8217;d need to wait, but before I got the gasoline and matches out to burn myself to death, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #444444; font-style: normal; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px;&quot;&gt;they piped in Bob Dylan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #444444; font-style: normal; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px;&quot;&gt;Something else came on that I didn&amp;#8217;t like next, but at least it wasn&amp;#8217;t the canned aspirational porn Rogers had subjected me to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Rogers and Apple subscribe to a music service ostensibly designed to soothe the ire of a customer with a problem. Except one uses music I&amp;#8217;m sure is part of the formula for RAGE from &amp;#8220;28 Days Later&amp;#8221; and the brilliant strategy of the other is to, simply, not do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All companies have problems. We accept that. But as a business owner or someone who cares about the brand they work for, how can you exploit the crummy reality of this fact?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can your brand suck less than all of the services and products your prospects will be frustrated by today?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: Let me give you a tip–it&amp;#8217;s not a greeter or a service person harassing them.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Little Video and a Big Lesson</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/2536/"/>
   <updated>2010-07-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/2536</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The subject of ear piercing came up with my 6 year old. For a couple reasons, I&amp;#8217;d rather she not. But rather than be the &amp;#8220;voice of authority&amp;#8221; sure to inspire rebellion, I showed her this:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, she thinks she should &amp;#8220;wait a while&amp;#8221; before piercing her ears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is to be learned from this little lesson in social media?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Video is a very effective means of communication. *&lt;/em&gt;Showing is much more effective than telling any day of the week. And it&amp;#8217;s never been easier to shoot or upload. Get yourself a little camera like this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theflip.com/en-ca/&quot;&gt;Flip camera &lt;/a&gt;and shoot away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Eliminate the voice of authority.&lt;/strong&gt; Of course I had an agenda in selecting that particular piece of footage. But, I didn&amp;#8217;t say a word before or after the viewing to suggest my point of view. Similarly, let good video stand on its own. It doesn&amp;#8217;t require commentary, voice over, supers, etc. to be effective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Keep it short. *&lt;/em&gt;Most adults have the attention span of a 6 year old. Make your point, and get out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Make it share worthy. *&lt;/em&gt;Sure there were other videos of kids getting their ears pierced at the mall. And I did show them just to be balanced. But I wouldn&amp;#8217;t post those vanilla vids on the blog. Borrrrring! This one&amp;#8217;s the most share worthy (poor kid.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Give it a good title. *&lt;/em&gt;Kylie&amp;#8217;s ear piercing trauma. Now that&amp;#8217;s a catchy title. I know what I&amp;#8217;m getting with that one. Don&amp;#8217;t give your video a generic name when you can tell people exactly what they&amp;#8217;ll get when they click on the video.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Eavesdropping and Digging for Pirate Rings</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/eavesdropping-and-digging-for-pirate-rings/"/>
   <updated>2010-06-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/eavesdropping-and-digging-for-pirate-rings</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2524&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/social-media-category/2522/eavesdropping-and-digging-for-pirate-rings/attachment/screen-shot-2010-06-29-at-4-13-27-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2524&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-06-29 at 4.13.27 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Screen-shot-2010-06-29-at-4.13.27-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;231&quot; height=&quot;408&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Listening is my new obsession. I&amp;#8217;m setting up a listening post for a client and I can&amp;#8217;t stop clicking links to find new folks to listen to. I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure this is connected to my obsession with other people&amp;#8217;s pictures. But, I digress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t know what a Listening Post is? It means aggregating all the blogs you read and terms you&amp;#8217;d like to search for into one location&amp;#8211;the most common free one is Google Reader. Google Reader lets you subscribe to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS&quot;&gt;RSS &lt;/a&gt; or feeds from the blogs you read. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chrisbrogan.com/grow-bigger-ears-in-10-minutes/&quot;&gt;Chris Brogan&lt;/a&gt; offers a succinct summary of the steps required to set up a Reader. But the long and short of it is that it is  an online subscription. Think of it as an actionable newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your Reader can be just for your reading pleasure. But most likely, it&amp;#8217;s content that you&amp;#8217;ll want to share.  Social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook are great platforms for sharing interesting links. What better way to demonstrate the range of your knowledge and the boundlessness of your curiosity than to share these links with other folks who have similar interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to creating a good reader is finding the right content to subscribe to. And this is where the addictive part comes in. Trolling through blogs  is like searching through a treasure chest, digging deep for a really great vintage broach or like a crazy funky pirate ring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the simple first steps I&amp;#8217;ve found work well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; *&lt;em&gt;Low Hanging Fruit: *&lt;/em&gt;Gather feeds from the sites you read regularly. This&amp;#8217;ll just make it simpler.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; *&lt;em&gt;Competitor Sites: *&lt;/em&gt;Never hurts to keep your eye on the competition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; *&lt;em&gt;What your Key Audiences Read: *&lt;/em&gt;If you know government stakeholders are reading the blog, then you should subscribe to policy feeds. If farmers are your audience, then you should be subscribing to this wonderful blog called &lt;a href=&quot;http://thebovine.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;The Bovine.&lt;/a&gt; Now you see why it&amp;#8217;s so addictive. Who knew such a wonderful niche blog existed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; *&lt;em&gt;Review your Twitter Feed: *&lt;/em&gt;Many of the people you follow and who follow you write blogs. There&amp;#8217;s a good chance that you have alot in common. Check out their blogs and subscribe if the fit is right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(Luke) Use the Links&lt;/strong&gt;: Review the links on sites you find relevant and then start clicking like mad. Don&amp;#8217;t be overwhelmed, like I said, most sites suck. Depending on your industry very few will be subscription worthy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; *&lt;em&gt;Subscribe to Keywords: *&lt;/em&gt;This part&amp;#8217;s kinda fun. Set up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/alerts&quot;&gt;Google Alerts &lt;/a&gt;for words you want to monitor across the entire world wide web-o-sphere. Google Alerts gives you the option of feeding this information directly into your Reader. It sounds complicated. But I swear it&amp;#8217;s not. What kids of words should you be searching for?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Your organization&amp;#8217;s name, name variations and your url (so, if you&amp;#8217;re company is Shur Thing, you should search for ShurThing and www.shurthing.com)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Your name and the names of others you want to follow (like your mentor and the competition&amp;#8217;s executives)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Competitors, with variations and urls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Keywords. Want to keep track of new California wineries? Use those very terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>The Lure of Faux Authenticity</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/the-lure-of-faux-authenticity/"/>
   <updated>2010-06-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/the-lure-of-faux-authenticity</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2514&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/2513/the-lure-of-faux-authenticity/attachment/screen-shot-2010-06-10-at-12-16-27-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2514&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-06-10 at 12.16.27 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Screen-shot-2010-06-10-at-12.16.27-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;248&quot; height=&quot;235&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been waiting a long time to find an article that helps me understand why &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.restorationhardware.com/rh/index.jsp&quot;&gt;Restoration Hardware&lt;/a&gt; carries items such as its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.restorationhardware.com/rh/catalog/product/product.jsp?productId=prod1593088&quot;&gt;Wine Barrel Chandelier&lt;/a&gt; described as &amp;#8220;Handcrafted from French Oak Wine Barrel Staves and Hoops&amp;#8221; in its mail order catalogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many old French wine barrels can there be lying around? Who wants to buy this kind of item through the mail?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally found the quintessential article on Salon.com today called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.salon.com/entertainment/tv/review/2009/10/07/man_shops_globe&quot;&gt;Overpriced Antiques for Anxious Yuppies.&lt;/a&gt; I found it by googling the words &amp;#8220;Reclaimed wood restoration hardware bullshit.&amp;#8221; Gotta love it when Google works so well.  The article does a brilliant job of describing our longing for objects that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trumpet their own authenticity and hint at a connection to the earth and an appreciation for craftsmanship and artistry and the untold charms of the world&amp;#8217;s foreign peoples&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course, the reality is these items are not authentic at all. They are just&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our new way of soothing ourselves over our lives of idle acquisition&amp;#8230;We pretend to appreciate the strong hands that fashioned this hand-woven wool rug or built that delightful floor lamp. In this age of ephemeral digital connections and vaporous 24-hour media feeds when most of us spend our days squinting at computer screens, it makes sense that we would be infatuated by the notion of real labor, that we would cling to the concreteness of old stuff that looks like it has a long and storied history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now there&amp;#8217;s a show that allows us to blow-up our fetish for the faux authentic. It&amp;#8217;s called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sundancechannel.com/man-shops-globe/&quot;&gt;Man Shops Globe&lt;/a&gt; which follows Keith Johnson, the lucky fellow who is head buyer for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/index.jsp&quot;&gt;Urban Outfitters&lt;/a&gt; (which owns &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.anthropologie.com/anthro/e4x/i18n.jsp;jsessionid=AA73CD8281CF62B46EB10BBC8CD6124B.app46-node2?_requestid=38512&quot;&gt;Anthropologie&lt;/a&gt;) and travels the world in search of authentic objects to knock-off for our shopping pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems we are at the peak postmodernism where the search for &amp;#8216;authenticity&amp;#8217; is utterly futile. Those exotic night markets in Thailand are ways for us to fetishize our idea of exoticism. And now, we don&amp;#8217;t even need to support their &amp;#8220;handicrafts&amp;#8221; to decorate our homes like we&amp;#8217;ve traveled the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Call it armchair exoticism. Call it faux authenticity. Bottom line is, it&amp;#8217;s just more of the same conspicuous consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The case for getting digital + social</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/the-case-for-getting-digital-and-social/"/>
   <updated>2010-06-08T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/the-case-for-getting-digital-and-social</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My newsletter from Yelp had some interesting numbers in it today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though we don&amp;#8217;t stop to think about much it, sites like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yelp.ca/&quot; title=&quot;Yelp.ca&quot;&gt;Yelp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gigpark.com/&quot;&gt;GigPark&lt;/a&gt;, Google Biz and  even &lt;a href=&quot;http://foursquare.com/&quot; title=&quot;Foursquare&quot;&gt;Foursquare&lt;/a&gt; are a great resource for qualified leads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They sit on a continuum of usefulness that ranges from a modern version of yellow pages to reading your mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Yelp,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  27% of all Yelp searches come from our iPhone Application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Last month (May), &lt;strong&gt;over half a million calls&lt;/strong&gt; were made to local businesses &lt;strong&gt;directly from Yelp&amp;#8217;s iPhone App&lt;/strong&gt;. That&amp;#8217;s about 1 call every 5 seconds to a business as a result of Yelp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Nearly &lt;strong&gt;a million people mapped door-to-door&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;directions&lt;/strong&gt; to a local business from their Yelp iPhone App last month.
And these are only the iPhone numbers. (&lt;a title=&quot;Don&#39;t forget&quot; href=&quot;http://www.yelp.com/yelpmobile&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t forget&lt;/a&gt;, we&amp;#8217;re on Android, Palm, and Blackberry as well!) In addition, Yelp&amp;#8217;s mobile traffic is only a fraction of our total traffic. Over 32 million people visited Yelp from desktop computers in the last 30 days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s a lot of people. Even if you don&amp;#8217;t use Yelp yourself, chances are you&amp;#8217;ve googled something and had a Yelp listing come up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I&amp;#8217;ve been logging on and using &lt;a href=&quot;http://canada411.ca/&quot; title=&quot;Canada411&quot;&gt;Canada411.ca&lt;/a&gt; for years instead of cluttering my small house with big phone books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the last time I was north of Toronto proper I found the best Szechuan I&amp;#8217;ve had since I moved here 14 years ago using Yelp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not sure anyone has an excuse not to spend the time it takes to fill in your profiles in these places (or have someone do it for you). Some of them even let you make an offer to prospective customers for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What services are you using?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Shit No One Needs: Vinyl Conference Folders</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/shit-no-one-needs-vinyl-conference-folders/"/>
   <updated>2010-06-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/shit-no-one-needs-vinyl-conference-folders</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2495&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/2484/shit-no-one-needs-vinyl-conference-folders/attachment/screen-shot-2010-06-03-at-11-02-10-am-2&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2495&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-06-03 at 11.02.10 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Screen-shot-2010-06-03-at-11.02.10-AM1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;256&quot; height=&quot;391&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;They&amp;#8217;re as ubiquitous as the name-on-a-string you wear around your neck at a conference. And, there&amp;#8217;s no good reason for their existence. PVC Conference Folders with a logo proudly emblazoned on the front. They say just one thing about the conference host&amp;#8211;they just couldn&amp;#8217;t be bothered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it&amp;#8217;s handy to have some paper to jot down notes at a conference. And there are an endless number of  promotions companies who can&amp;#8217;t wait to sell you their cheap, plastic conference folders and accompanying pen. 100 clipboards&amp;#8217;ll run you $7.50 + a $60 set up fee. They can pump &amp;#8216;em out like hotcakes. Or, like widgets. Pick your metaphor. But there&amp;#8217;s one problem. They suck. Hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Hypenotic headquarters, we&amp;#8217;re used to asking, &amp;#8216;why?&amp;#8217; Why a brochure? Why a website? Why a conference? When we questioned our client&amp;#8217;s (the &amp;#8216;raddest of the rad&amp;#8217; &lt;a href=&quot;http://push.ca/blogs/pete/archive/2009/06/16/matt-houghton-action-sports-media-renaissance-man.aspx&quot;&gt;Matt Houghton&lt;/a&gt;) first instinct to give away vinyl folders he was immediately primed to switch gears. This was a guy who understood the value of authenticity better than anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were helping Matt put together a Media Lab for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.push.ca/&quot;&gt;Push.ca&lt;/a&gt;, a Sympatico portal that is the most authentic Canadian voice on Skateboarding and Snowboarding. Push.ca was hosting the Media Lab to show potential advertisers Push.ca had the right people, content and ideas to speak to this niche audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scene was set to give the attendees an experience that was as cool as this culture. We reserved the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gladstonehotel.com/about&quot;&gt;Gladstone Hotel&lt;/a&gt;, ordered upscale street food like nachos and grilled cheese sandwiches, and had the hottest lineup of former pros turned marketers to lend insight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of a vinyl conference folder, we came up with an environmentally friendly pad, with each cover hand screened with the Push.ca logo. The pads were screened by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thebaitshop.ca/&quot;&gt;The Bait Shop&lt;/a&gt;, a spot so invested in skate culture that they have a half pipe in their showroom. Beyond the half pipe, their space features a  printshop and gallery. We further featured the Bait Shops&amp;#8217; skills by having them screenprint Push.ca t-shirts on site during the Media Lab, in full view of the participants. It was cool eye candy. When folks walked in, they were asked what colour shirt and what colour screen print they wanted. And, at the end of the day, they walked away with something authentic and hand rendered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, tell me again why you were thinking about getting one of those vinyl conference folders?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Shit No One Needs: KD with Freeze Dried Cauliflower</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/2475/"/>
   <updated>2010-05-31T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/2475</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2474&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/blog/2475/2475/attachment/screen-shot-2010-05-31-at-4-40-08-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2474&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-05-31 at 4.40.08 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Screen-shot-2010-05-31-at-4.40.08-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;241&quot; height=&quot;335&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;So Kraft decided to grind a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weightymatters.ca/2010/05/badvertising-kd-smart-thinks-youre-kd.html&quot;&gt;negligible amount of cauliflower&lt;/a&gt; into it&amp;#8217;s KD and place it under it&amp;#8217;s  oh-so-credible &amp;#8220;KD Smart&amp;#8221; moniker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is the smart part? Well, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogger.com/profile/15855979454844538601&quot;&gt;Yoni Freedhoff&lt;/a&gt;, Ottawa Family Doctor and founder of a multi-disciplinary, ethical, evidence-based nutrition and weight management centre (is that enough cred for you people?) a serving of this cauliflower goodness has the equivalent of 2 tablespoons of veggies as well as more fat, sugar and salt than regular KD. Oh, and it has 33% less actual KD than the other kinds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ad (which I spotted in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;amp;client=safari&amp;amp;rls=en&amp;amp;ei=0iEETJj0Ao-ANsKE0Ts&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=spell&amp;amp;resnum=0&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;ved=0CBsQBSgA&amp;amp;q=reader%27s+digest&amp;amp;spell=1&quot;&gt;Reader&amp;#8217;s Digest&lt;/a&gt;) proudly introduces &amp;#8220;Cauliflower that tastes like KD.&amp;#8221; Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s like calling German Chocolate Cake &amp;#8220;Rasberries that taste like chocolate.&amp;#8221; Or jeans, &amp;#8220;Zippers with Legs&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this from the folks who were behind &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-05-17/kraft-pepsico-pledge-to-aid-first-lady-s-campaign-update1-.html&quot;&gt;Michelle Obama&amp;#8217;s anti-obesity campaign?&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;#8217;m stunned, really. I think that the other supporters of Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation like Pepsi, General Mills and Kellogs should kick them out of the club.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Shit No One Needs: Exfoliator</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/shit-no-one-needs-exfoliator/"/>
   <updated>2010-05-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/shit-no-one-needs-exfoliator</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2463&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/2457/shit-no-one-needs-exfoliator/attachment/screen-shot-2010-05-27-at-3-20-32-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2463&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-05-27 at 3.20.32 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Screen-shot-2010-05-27-at-3.20.32-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; height=&quot;407&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is the first submission in a new series I&amp;#8217;m launching called &lt;em&gt;Shit No One Needs&lt;/em&gt;. The articles in this series will highlight the consumer products and services that serve no real purpose to anyone. Other agencies market that kind of stuff really, really well. So well, they&amp;#8217;ve helped convince lots of people to buy shit they don&amp;#8217;t need. We &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/about-us&quot;&gt;choose to work with values based companies&lt;/a&gt; who do things people actually care about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years ago, Seth Godin wrote a blog post that spelled it out in his usual succinct manner:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re a good marketer (or even worse, a great marketer), it means that you&amp;#8217;re responsible for what you sell. When you choose to sell it, more of it gets sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#8217;t choose to sell shit no one needs. We choose to talk about the stuff that gets sold that should not. So here goes&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one needs exfoliator. They don&amp;#8217;t need the kind made out of organic ingredients (that still has lots of unfriendly packaging) and they don&amp;#8217;t need the kind with tiny beads made from big long chemical words no one can pronounce. Many of those complicated multi-sylabic words cause cancer and other unfun diseases. Check the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ewg.org/&quot;&gt;Environmental Working Group&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s Skin Deep Database for a listing of all the wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cosmeticsdatabase.com/browse.php?category=exfoliant/scrub&quot;&gt;ingredients in exfoliants &lt;/a&gt;and other cosmetics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to get rid of dead skin cells on your face + body. Here are simple instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Step out of shower&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Grab towel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Rub towel vigorously over face and body&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Repeat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t believe me? &lt;a href=&quot;http://beauty.about.com/b/2008/04/03/simple-face-washing-tip-use-a-washcloth.htm&quot;&gt;Read this.&lt;/a&gt; Don&amp;#8217;t go and buy an exfoliating towel. That&amp;#8217;s just redundant. Just use your plain old bath towel, and rub it around. You&amp;#8217;ll feel glorious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an alternative perspective, watch this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6RuHgJ7us8&quot;&gt;terrific video&lt;/a&gt; on exfoliation that encourages you to scrub your face with chemical beads before smearing petroleum jelly all over your face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information on exfoliator and other heinous cosmetics check out Treehugger&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/09/ugly-beauty.php&quot;&gt;5 Ugly Truths You May Not Know About the Beauty Industry.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, stay tuned. Next stop cycle clips for your pants.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Uses + Abuses of Genre</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/the-uses-abuses-of-genre/"/>
   <updated>2010-05-25T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/the-uses-abuses-of-genre</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2450&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/2442/the-uses-abuses-of-genre/attachment/screen-shot-2010-05-25-at-11-11-52-am&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2450&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-05-25 at 11.11.52 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Screen-shot-2010-05-25-at-11.11.52-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;385&quot; height=&quot;233&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;#1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An invitation to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://secure.communaltable.ca/&quot;&gt;very appetizing event&lt;/a&gt; featuring local food described in loving detail: &amp;#8220;Be tantalized by the aroma of grilling steaks and chops from Cumbrae’s while savouring fine wines and beers from local vineyards and microbreweries.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the bottom of the page it reads &amp;#8220;We t&lt;em&gt;hankfully acknowledge&lt;/em&gt; our fabulous local producers&amp;#8221; with a list of event sponsors. The juxtaposition between the first and second parts of that sentence strikes me, and not just for its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.english-test.net/forum/ftopic13048.html&quot;&gt;grammatical awkwardness&lt;/a&gt;. Why the sudden default to &amp;#8220;event speak&amp;#8221; with &amp;#8220;thankfully acknowledge&amp;#8221;? Especially in the context of so much other beautiful prose. Why not just say &amp;#8220;The incredible local food you&amp;#8217;ll be enjoying was donated by a bunch of generous Ontario local producers listed below.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do we feel the need to revert of stuffy formalities in certain circumstances?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;2&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.ca/Encyclopedia-Ordinary-Life-Krouse-Rosenthal/dp/1400080452&quot;&gt;Encyclopedia of an Ordinary Life&lt;/a&gt; is Amy Krouse Rosenthal&amp;#8217;s version of memoir, written in encyclopedic form. Read her entry under &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.ca/books?id=ZiRNAzbEE4YC&amp;amp;pg=PA74&amp;amp;lpg=PA74&amp;amp;dq=amy+krouse+rosenthal+clapping&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=EMPGkMqQZW&amp;amp;sig=xqFvslXUCeJBGX9AImRVmCiiikM&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=fNL7S4fSIomGNru99ZkB&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=2&amp;amp;ved=0CBcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;&amp;#8216;C&amp;#8217; for Clapping&lt;/a&gt; and see how funny this innovative format can be. It turns the genre of memoir inside out. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.villagevoice.com/books/0508,park,61332,10.html&quot;&gt;The Village Voice&lt;/a&gt; says &amp;#8220;taking the name of a genre obsessed with fixed knowledge, Rosenthal time and again pokes holes in the sober format.&amp;#8221; Why not use a tired dying genre and repurpose it to tell your own story? Why revert to &amp;#8220;we thankfully acknowledge&amp;#8221; when there so many more meaningful ways to express oneself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;3&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2448&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/2442/the-uses-abuses-of-genre/attachment/screen-shot-2010-05-25-at-11-04-44-am&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2448&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-05-25 at 11.04.44 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Screen-shot-2010-05-25-at-11.04.44-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;328&quot; height=&quot;233&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;CAMH, whom I have criticized in &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/blog/1751/hey-camh-im-quitting-quitting&quot;&gt;previous blogs&lt;/a&gt;, has struck one out of the park with their agency &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zigideas.com/&quot;&gt;Zig &lt;/a&gt;by appropriating the genre of &lt;a href=&quot;http://adland.tv/ooh/centre-addiction-mental-health-selling-hospital-condos-including-model-suite&quot;&gt;condominium advertising&lt;/a&gt;. The metaphor extends right down to a &amp;#8220;model suite&amp;#8221; you can visit on the Queen Street Site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The metaphor is a fitting one, since, as CAMH President and CEO says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s about lifestyle, and dignified human surroundings for people with mental illness and addiction. It’s also about the city building aspect of what we’re doing – it’s really a new kind of hospital. It is very much a part of the community, and the community is part of it, which is something that hasn’t happened nearly enough in the world of mental illness and addiction.” (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nowtoronto.com/daily/story.cfm?content=174366&quot;&gt;NOW Magazine&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PSA genre, heavy with stories and serious issues gets a refreshing new life in the form of a new genre. The digital campaign is less bold in it&amp;#8217;s departure from traditional PSA, reverting to stories and not taking the idea as far as it could. But, a noble effort nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Carl The Plastic Baby</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/carl-the-plastic-baby/"/>
   <updated>2010-05-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/carl-the-plastic-baby</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2436&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/branding/2432/carl-the-plastic-baby/attachment/screen-shot-2010-05-20-at-11-11-44-am&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2436&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-05-20 at 11.11.44 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Screen-shot-2010-05-20-at-11.11.44-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;382&quot; height=&quot;199&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you seen Carl the Plastic Baby? I first spotted the intriguing billboard featuring a plastic baby on Queen West at Gladstone. Unlike other obvious teaser campaigns, this one left me asking who was behind the billboard and what it meant. So, I visited &lt;a href=&quot;http://carltheplasticbaby.com/&quot;&gt;carltheplasticbaby.com&lt;/a&gt;, the url posted in tiny print on the billboard. The site asks the question &amp;#8220;Are you interested in having a child but you don&amp;#8217;t want all the hassles?&amp;#8221; and offers a means to purchase a plastic baby of any ethnicity delivered directly to your door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s it all about? &lt;a href=&quot;http://unurth.com/418139/Fauxreel-Carl-The-Plastic-Baby-Toronto&quot;&gt;Unurth&lt;/a&gt;,  a site that showcases street art around the world highlights Carl, and it&amp;#8217;s creater street artist fauxreel who is  best known for his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/2cauldrons/2817923221/&quot;&gt;Squareheads Vespa &lt;/a&gt;series. In that series, Fauxreel is exploring&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grey area between street art, graffiti and advertising and attempting to make connections between products and people’s identities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carl the Plastic Baby walks this line as well. According to Fauxreel, the Carl billboards are based on the commoditization of children whose parents eagerly buy up any and all unnecessary products to (in Fauxreel&amp;#8217;s words) &amp;#8220;keep up with the Jones&amp;#8221;&amp;#8221; And, the demographic fact that people are having their kids later in life. Carl is the ideal solution to this dilemma since:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;buying a plastic baby might help those who don&amp;#8217;t have one of their own yet to feel like they belong&amp;#8230;Which is what advertising is all about&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a time when a stroller like an uber modern &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stokke.com/en-ca/&quot;&gt;Stoke &lt;/a&gt;can run you more than a flight to Paris, we need to question the commoditization of baby-hood. Have you roamed through a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.toysrus.ca/home/index.jsp&quot;&gt;Toys R Us&lt;/a&gt; store recently? A balanced parent can barely find anything to buy in a store full of plastic doo-dads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The response to that has been the creation of all kinds of &amp;#8220;eco-friendly&amp;#8221; stuff made for kids. Know what&amp;#8217;s even more environmentally friendly? Not buying stuff at all&amp;#8211;a case that is so beautifully made in the Creative Commons video &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.storyofstuff.com/&quot;&gt;The Story Stuff&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if along with the stuff, we bought the baby too? As is highlighted on the Carl site, it would be oh so convenient: &amp;#8220;No crying. No pooing. No babysitter.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since making babies is an afterthought&amp;#8211;after schooling ourselves to death, after launching our successful careers, buying a house, etc. we could skip all the hassles of being aging parents with Carl. Check out the links on the site if you need to make the case not to have kids. They include &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.babycenter.com/babyCostCalculator.htm&quot;&gt;The Baby Cost Calculator&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://childfreedom.blogspot.com/2009/03/top-100-reasons-not-to-have-kids-and.html&quot;&gt;Top 100 Reasons Not to Have Kids&lt;/a&gt;, and a link to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://nosefrida.com/&quot;&gt;Baby Snot Sucker. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By placing this message among the advertising messages that bombard us every day Fauxreel has succeeded in giving us pause to consider the shit that is sold to us every day, and the stories that compel us to buy shit we simply don&amp;#8217;t need. So, thanks Carl, I&amp;#8217;ll take 2&amp;#8211;one white and one brown-ish.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2412&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/social-media-category/2406/ask-and-you-shall-receive/attachment/screen-shot-2010-05-18-at-11-05-58-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2412&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-05-18 at 11.05.58 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Screen-shot-2010-05-18-at-11.05.58-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;321&quot; height=&quot;361&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Mom to kid: &amp;#8220;How was school?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kid: &amp;#8220;fine&amp;#8221; &lt;long silence&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mom to kid &amp;#8220;What song did you sing at school today?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kid: &amp;#8220;Oh we sang lalalala. It was so funny because&amp;#8230;.blah blah blah&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s that same information translated into social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask people to contribute by having a big empty comments box under your clever blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reaction: Empty comments box&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask people to share &lt;a href=&quot;http://fiestafarms.ca/2049/food/moms-cooking-best-served-with-pepto-tell-us&quot;&gt;mom&amp;#8217;s worst cooking story&lt;/a&gt; (oh and offer them a little incentive in the form of a contest) ask them to share their favorite &lt;a href=&quot;http://fiestafarms.ca/1421/food/canadiana&quot;&gt;truly Canadian foods &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reaction: Submissions (check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://fiestafarms.ca/2063/apron-strings/how-not-to-cook-lessons-from-my-mother&quot;&gt;this one by our very own Barry Martin&lt;/a&gt;), tweets, photos, videos and the like. Funny, well written and engaging content that makes for great posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rub: Don&amp;#8217;t ask people to react to social media in general terms. Ask them for something specific that will tweak their interest, get them to giggle,  reflect or identify in some way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s just like all social interactions, a legitimate connection opens up the lines of communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A better question will get you more responses of much higher caliber. You don&amp;#8217;t have to offer incentives or turn it into a contest to be successful. But, it does help lower the barrier to entry so people can start crossing over from observers to participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what&amp;#8217;s the blog post, tweet, question that&amp;#8217;s gotten you the most comments or responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t leave me hangin&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Brilliant Brand Emulsion: Lunch at Delux</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2397&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/branding/2374/2374/attachment/screen-shot-2010-05-14-at-3-16-59-pm-2&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2397&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-05-14 at 3.16.59 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Screen-shot-2010-05-14-at-3.16.59-PM1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;311&quot; height=&quot;408&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I just had a great Cuban lunch at a French restaurant. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.deluxrestaurant.ca/&quot;&gt;Delux&lt;/a&gt;, a hot spot on Ossington Ave has opened for lunch. Instead of serving the traditional bistro fare they do so beautifully at night, they decided to give their lunch a Cuban bent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chef and owner Corrina Mozo is a Montrealer with Cuban roots, so the mix of cultures comes naturally. Way back in 2008 when they first opened Mozo said &amp;#8220;French bistro dishes just call to me. I was going to do French-Cuban, but once the Canadian winter hit, I couldn&amp;#8217;t do it,&amp;#8221; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/302940&quot;&gt;Toronto Star, 2008&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out Delux didn&amp;#8217;t just serve up a great Cuban lunch (the Avocado, citrus, green olive salad is crazy-good) they also reminded me of an important lesson in branding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is Delux doing messing with their slam dunk French food by serving  Cuban during the day? Are they French or Cuban?  The short answer is they are animating their brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delux&amp;#8217;s food has always had something of a Cuban bent. But, as the chef discussed with me today, those two genres of food don&amp;#8217;t &amp;#8216;fuse&amp;#8217; together easily&amp;#8211;thus making true fusion cooking an impossibility. So, they brought Cuban food and flavour into the mix in an entirely different way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People tend to be very rigid when they think about their brand. They believe their logo has to look the same wherever it goes (with the same PMS colour). That their website needs to have the same copy as their brochure. That they need to say the same thing about themselves over and over (and over) again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They forget what we know about people. Your friend can change his clothes, hairstyle, cologne. And, he still remains himself. This is true of brands as well. Consider&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  When we reprinted our business cards recently, everyone got their own brand new colour. They are our warmer weather colours. In fact, back in the day, Hypenotic had a day card and a night card&amp;#8211;each with it&amp;#8217;s own colour palate. People loved them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fiestafarms.ca&quot;&gt;Fiesta Farms&amp;#8217; &lt;/a&gt;website header literally changes with the weather. Visit to see our spring treatment before it turns to summer (that reminds me, we&amp;#8217;ve got to start working on that).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Philippe Stark designs &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hudsonhotel.com/&quot;&gt;fancy-shmantsy hotels &lt;/a&gt;and makes cheap, functional stuff for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.target.com&quot;&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The Mumps vaccine is a serious subject. The Ontario Government&amp;#8217;s website is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.health.gov.on.ca/english/public/pub/disease/mumps.html&quot;&gt;loaded with information &lt;/a&gt;about why you should be vaccinated. But that didn&amp;#8217;t stop them (and their agency &lt;a href=&quot;http://partnersandedell.com/&quot;&gt;Partners + Edell&lt;/a&gt;) from making a funny spot about the mumps. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you&amp;#8217;ve seen an ad about the impact of the Mumps on one&amp;#8217;s balls, you probably don&amp;#8217;t feel like eating Conch Fritters. But when you go you go Delux, they&amp;#8217;re not to be missed. Oh, and don&amp;#8217;t miss the donuts either.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Think Like a Lobbyist</title>

   <id>http://getpoole.com/think-like-a-lobbyist</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2369&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/2368/think-like-a-lobbyist/attachment/screen-shot-2010-05-10-at-9-40-02-am&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2369&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-05-10 at 9.40.02 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Screen-shot-2010-05-10-at-9.40.02-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;415&quot; height=&quot;330&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week,&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/bittman&quot;&gt; Mark Bittman Tweeted&lt;/a&gt; a link from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://beyondgreen.weaversway.coop/2010/05/soda-lobbyists-say-durndest-things.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A%20weaversway%2FBG%20%28Beyond%20Green%29&amp;amp;utm_content=Google%20Reader&quot;&gt;Beyond Green &lt;/a&gt;blog where the author quotes an NPR interview with the Vice President of the American Beverage Association. In the interview, the Big Soda representative attempts to make soda seem necessary for kids based on its hydrating properties:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;..Children who have been exercising may not drink enough water to get back to the hydration point that they need to be at.  So with a little bit of flavoring and a little bit of sweetness, they will drink enough then to get back to where they need to be.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blogger of course responds that the lobby groups wants &amp;#8220;to make sure we realize that soda is positively healthy because it&amp;#8217;s 99% water, and water is an important nutrient. &amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking about this argument, and have come up with a few of my own that could be used by other lobby/interest groups to bolster their agendas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forces.org/canada/files/about.htm&quot;&gt;Forces Canada&lt;/a&gt;, the pro-choice smoking organization: Smoking is good for you, because it helps you step back from your troubles and reduces stress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Catholic Church: Unprotected sex is healthy because it reduces environmental waste (no condom disposal)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.activehealthykids.ca/&quot;&gt;Active Healthy Kids Canada&lt;/a&gt;: Bullying is healthy, it promotes exercise (running away from the horrible kid perp)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help me out folks. Got any to add to the list?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Turn that Party Inside Out</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/turn-that-party-inside-out/"/>
   <updated>2010-05-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/turn-that-party-inside-out</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2342&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/social-media-category/2340/turn-that-party-inside-out/attachment/screen-shot-2010-05-06-at-10-12-50-am&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2342&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-05-06 at 10.12.50 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Screen-shot-2010-05-06-at-10.12.50-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;208&quot; height=&quot;208&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The typical kid&amp;#8217;s birthday party. You invite the kids, play the usual games, open presents and then crack out the video camera in time for the cake and the blowing out of candles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you thought about the party from the perspective of posterity? The video might be more important than an afterthought. What if you gave the historical record of the party equal priority to the party itself? Would you make a nicer cake? Smile more?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you cringe with thoughts of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120382/&quot;&gt;Truman Show &lt;/a&gt;consider this&amp;#8211;you might interview your child a few moments before the guests arrive to ask your daughter &amp;#8220;How does it feel to be 3?&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;Why did you choose to wear that dress?&amp;#8221; And after the party you might ask her to reflect on how it all went. In between you&amp;#8217;d capture all the moments (hopefully) worth remembering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now think about social media content in a much more grown-up context. There are a multitude of ways social media can be integrated into events once they&amp;#8217;ve been planned. Chris Brogan has an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chrisbrogan.com/how-events-can-use-social-media/&quot;&gt;outstanding article&lt;/a&gt; on how to promote and extend the value of your events using social media. And, there are other helpful articles outlining how &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eventcoup.com/10-ways-social-media-will-transform-events-in&quot;&gt;social media is already transforming events.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my focus is slightly different. I&amp;#8217;d like you to consider how the corporate parties, events, gatherings, talks, conferences  you participate in would look different if you were thinking about them from the perspective of web content&amp;#8211;right from the get-go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Would you spend a bit more to get the better speaker knowing it could live on your site?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Would you fly the attendees in the night before so you could have a chance to talk to them about their expectations for the event, why they came as marketing for your event in the future?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Would you host an after-party to gather reflections on the event?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Would you select a different venue?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Would you add a unique twist to the party that could make for an interesting conversation piece to be captured during the course of the day?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, clients come to us with a list of events and initiatives in hand, and we work with them to develop a social media matrix where we collaborate to come up with useful, relevant content that could emerge from an event or activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the social media content would be considered beforehand and inform decisions every step of the way. After all the &amp;#8220;audience&amp;#8221; for your event extends far beyond the people who will actually be able to attend. Your virtual attendees may in fact be far greater than the folks who can be there in person. Nothing wrong with that. In fact, you may chose to host a small gathering with the purpose of generating content&amp;#8211;small gatherings are perfect for chatting with folks with minimal noise disruption. Here are some reflections on how to think about planning your events for your &amp;#8216;real&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;virtual&amp;#8217; audiences:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2353&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/social-media-category/2340/turn-that-party-inside-out/attachment/screen-shot-2010-05-06-at-10-43-27-am&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2353&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-05-06 at 10.43.27 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Screen-shot-2010-05-06-at-10.43.27-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;132&quot; height=&quot;176&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Get a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theflip.com/en-ca/&quot;&gt;Flip Camera&lt;/a&gt;. It costs $200, it fits in your pocket and it&amp;#8217;s typically all you need. Well, that and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.theflip.com/en-ca/products/Product.aspx?SKU=AAT1B&quot;&gt;small tripod&lt;/a&gt; you can use to set up when you want more intimate one-on-one conversations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Consider your guest list. Are there people you&amp;#8217;d like to be able to &amp;#8216;show&amp;#8217; attending your event? Be sure to invite them along. But also know they won&amp;#8217;t come unless there&amp;#8217;s something in it for them (fun, food, networking, profile, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Consider pre and post events. Create as many opportunities to talk with people as possible in a range of venues. Let&amp;#8217;s face it, the &amp;#8220;networking lunch&amp;#8221; sessions are busy and crowded. Not ideal for content creation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Get a room. You might want to rent a room at the venue especially to interview folks during the event. Supply it with snacks, beverages, etc and promise people, &amp;#8220;it&amp;#8217;ll only take 5 mins,&amp;#8221; and then stand by it. Don&amp;#8217;t take up too much of people&amp;#8217;s time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Create a topic, a visual focus&amp;#8212;Something for people to reflect on. It&amp;#8217;s like this, if I ask my daughter &amp;#8220;how was school today,&amp;#8221; I get a blank stare. If I ask her, &amp;#8220;What craft did you do today&amp;#8221; I&amp;#8217;ll actually get an answer. Give people specific items to focus on and then ask them specific questions. Create a giant board where people can write down their thoughts on a specific question and capture it in real time video. We made a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fiestafarms.ca&quot;&gt;Fiesta Farms&lt;/a&gt; party into a potluck and we&amp;#8217;re excited to have the chance to talk to everyone about the dish they decided to bring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have no idea why this brilliant video has only 173 views on YouTube. In fact, I just finished reviewing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/top_10_youtube_videos_of_all_time.php#comment-208688&quot;&gt;Top 10 You Tube Videos of all Time&lt;/a&gt;, and I think this little gem is ready to go BIG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be that I have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fiestafarms.ca&quot;&gt;Fiesta Farms&lt;/a&gt; and grandmas on the brain as we get ready to roll out the Apron Strings series this week. But, I don&amp;#8217;t think so. I think I know genius when I see it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Will You Answer the Call of Social Media?</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/2313/"/>
   <updated>2010-04-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/2313</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2319&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/social-media-category/2313/2313/attachment/screen-shot-2010-04-30-at-10-04-14-am&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2319&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-04-30 at 10.04.14 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-30-at-10.04.14-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;285&quot; height=&quot;386&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I get it.  There is the thrill of the sudden blip in sales that comes from a big flashing sign, or a &amp;#8216;going out of business sale.&amp;#8217; Just yesterday my father, who owned a furniture business in Toronto and is a proud inventor of many of the unique twists in schlock advertising (&amp;#8220;no money down, no interest until 2025!!!&amp;#8221;) asked me about how we can translate the &lt;a href=&quot;http://fiestafarms.ca/&quot;&gt;Fiesta Farms&lt;/a&gt; website into the direct sale of groceries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, of course, is not a new question. It&amp;#8217;s the question on every company&amp;#8217;s lips as they begin considering devoting time + resources to social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a small handful of businesses the ROI on social media is instantaneous. Inc. Magazine has summed up the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inc.com/twitter/&quot;&gt;top 5 ways to make money, quickly, using Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. So, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.threadless.com&quot;&gt;Threadless &lt;/a&gt;has sold loads of t-shirts turning Tweets into custom t-shirt messages, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://kogibbq.com/&quot;&gt;Kogi Korean BBQ &lt;/a&gt;Tweets where folks can find their food carts in LA, and people rush to the intersection to get their bulgogi fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry to disappoint, but if your not a travelling food cart or t-shirt designer  you need to get over the need for instant gratification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;What social media does is simply allow you to do one thing: communicate. That&amp;#8217;s it. Social media is not the conversation. It&amp;#8217;s the room in which you hold the conversation. It still comes down to saying, doing, or producing something valuable for your customer&amp;#8230;.Companies that get it will find social media a valuable tool &amp;#8212; if they they are prepared to stick it out and learn how it works.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #222222;&quot;&gt;Maltoni says that social media is the modern telephone. It is a communications portal, and like anything else in life, what you put in is what you get out. The value of the relationships you build on social media networks is the product of the time, energy and intelligence you&amp;#8217;re willing to invest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #222222;&quot;&gt;For &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zappos.com&quot;&gt;Zappos &lt;/a&gt;every single phone conversation is a meaningful relationship builder. How could you be having conversations on social media that build relationships? If you want to use this platform as a bullhorn spewing out information about yourself, I&amp;#8217;m afraid you&amp;#8217;ve missed the call of social media. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Isn’t it Ironic?</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/isnt-it-ironic/"/>
   <updated>2010-04-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/isnt-it-ironic</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The organization Magazine Publishers of America has banned together with five of the most powerful magazine publishing companies in the US (including heavy hitters like Condé Nast and Hearst Magazines) to fight what they c&lt;a href=&quot;http://multivu.prnewswire.com/mnr/magazines/42679/&quot;&gt;all misperceptions about the magazine readership&lt;/a&gt; that are leading to dwindling ad revenue. In all of this, the internet is positioned as good, but not *that good. *And those who praise the internet as the death knoll for magazines as full of hot air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the publishers have launched a pretty powerful print campaign. And they kicked it off with this little video (on YouTube of course)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the You Tube video you watched above &lt;em&gt;does not allow comments (&lt;/em&gt;how not to use the internet*) *A number of  bloggers, like Evan Schnittman from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blackplasticglasses.com/2010/03/15/powerlessness-advertising/&quot;&gt;Black Plastic Glasses&lt;/a&gt; have lined up to  poke holes in every single factoid the magazine industry presents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*I&amp;#8217;m guessing the real power of print is that it doesn&amp;#8217;t talk back. But, the magazine industry overlooked that they can&amp;#8217;t control the conversation no matter how hard they try.&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>The Toronto Coffee Conspiracy</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/the-toronto-coffee-conspiracy/"/>
   <updated>2010-04-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/the-toronto-coffee-conspiracy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2285&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/2280/the-toronto-coffee-conspiracy/attachment/screen-shot-2010-04-22-at-10-20-29-am&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2285&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-04-22 at 10.20.29 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-22-at-10.20.29-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;258&quot; height=&quot;267&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Maybe it&amp;#8217;s the coffee talking. But this feels like one of the most brilliant marketing ideas I&amp;#8217;ve heard about in a long time. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=11345168382&quot;&gt;The Toronto Coffee Conspiracy &lt;/a&gt; (TCC) is an initiative spearheaded by seven independent Toronto coffee shops that are committed to what they call Craft Coffee. To them, that means understanding quality coffee where it comes from and sharing that passion with customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sitting here at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.litespressobar.com/&quot;&gt;Lit Espresso Bar &lt;/a&gt;in Roncesvalles where I&amp;#8217;m enjoying an Americano (my 3rd coffee and it&amp;#8217;s only 9:45am) and I&amp;#8217;ve been handed what the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalpost.com/news/canada/toronto/story.html?id=2931692&quot;&gt;National Post&lt;/a&gt; called a &amp;#8220;disloyalty card&amp;#8221; inviting me to try the coffee at other shops scattered throughout the city. So, if I get my card stamped at Lit, and then go and get my card stamped at place like &lt;a href=&quot;http://samjamescoffeebar.com/&quot;&gt;Sam James Coffee Bar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.darkhorseespresso.com/&quot;&gt;Dark Horse&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://maniccoffee.com/&quot;&gt;Manic Coffee&lt;/a&gt; I can return back to Lit and get a free coffee. Their tag line says it all: &amp;#8220;Sure. Go behind our backs.&amp;#8221; It&amp;#8217;s not cheating to go to another coffee shop. It&amp;#8217;s helping grow the independent coffee movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The card itself however is not where the brilliance lies. The name and idea of a conspiracy is what gets that Americano-infused blood pumping through my veins. These folks are starting a godamned conspiracy. If you have walked into an independent coffee shop on the list, you know (as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/toronto/inside-the-toronto-coffee-conspiracy/article1521566/&quot;&gt;Globe and Mail &lt;/a&gt;mentions) the owners are opinionated, strong willed and crazy passionate. It is in the spirit of this that they are standing up and declaring themselves co-conspirators in getting Torontonians to visit independent coffee shops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the short time that the Toronto Coffee Conspiracy has been percolating they&amp;#8217;ve garnered enough press to be the envy of any large chain. This is not the kind of attention that is often bestowed upon independent shops in their own corner of the universe. How did they do it? They decided to pick a fight, delclare it and buck convention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Convention would say that the various independent coffee shops are competitors, battling each other for share of heart and mind. Convention would say stay in your silo, put your head down, and promote yourself as better than other folks who do what you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being independent thinkers, they realized (as they told &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestar.com/living/food/article/794054--disloyalty-has-its-privileges&quot;&gt;The Star)&lt;/a&gt; “We all have something great to offer and we all do it a little different.&amp;#8221; They also realized that coffee shops are community hubs. Because each of the shops are in a different neighbourhood they realized that promoting their coffee shops also meant promoting the neighbourhoods they&amp;#8217;re located in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would be different about your business if you stopped worrying about the competition and thought about your higher purpose? Who would be your ally? Who could you join forces with? What shit storm could you cause?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2286&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/2280/the-toronto-coffee-conspiracy/attachment/screen-shot-2010-04-22-at-10-21-44-am&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2286&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-04-22 at 10.21.44 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-22-at-10.21.44-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;328&quot; height=&quot;229&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It takes alot of energy to be consumed with what everyone else is doing. It&amp;#8217;s like high school. If you&amp;#8217;re so busy obsessing about the popular girl (and what she wears, what she drives, who she hangs with)  you&amp;#8217;re far less likely to discover your  own style or thang. You&amp;#8217;re also less likely to join forces with other chics who are like you&amp;#8211;a little offbeat but cool in your own right (do I sound like I suffered in Junior High? This is like my almost 40 year old self speaking to my 15 year old self).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a tip from any one of Toronto&amp;#8217;s seven Coffee Conspiracy shops. Competition is way over rated.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to be Not Nice and Prosper</title>

   <updated>2010-04-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/non</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2269&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/branding/2245/non/attachment/screen-shot-2010-04-20-at-2-36-35-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2269&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-04-20 at 2.36.35 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-20-at-2.36.35-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;380&quot; height=&quot;245&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I&amp;#8217;m tired of apologies. These days everyone apologizes far too frequently and without a shred of sincerity. Make a racist comment? Apologize. Cheat on your wife? Apologize. Lie, cheat, steal. Apologize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe there&amp;#8217;s alot to be said for *not *apologizing. What a refreshing gesture.  It takes integrity to not apologize.  One guy who understood integrity and proved the power of not apologizing was &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lennon&quot;&gt;John Lennon&lt;/a&gt;. When in a 1966 interview he told reporters  that the Beatles were more popular than Jesus adding &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t know which will go first&amp;#8211;rock &amp;#8216;n&amp;#8217; roll or Christianity,&amp;#8221; he stood behind them fight&amp;#8217;n words&lt;span style=&quot;color: #222222;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 25px; font-size: small;&quot;&gt;. Even as US radio stations banned the Beatles&amp;#8217; music and teenagers burned their records, Lennon refused to relent. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lennon was sorry that people misunderstood his message. But he was not sorry he said the Beatles were bigger than Jesus. Fact is they were.  In fact later in life, Lennon said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #222222;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 25px; font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt; &amp;#8220;I always remember to thank Jesus for the end of my touring days; if I hadn&amp;#8217;t said that The Beatles were &amp;#8216;bigger than Jesus&amp;#8217; and upset the very Christian Ku Klux Klan well, Lord, I might still be up there with all the other performing fleas! God bless America. Thank you, Jesus.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #222222; line-height: 25px;&quot;&gt;Consider all the the things you can  be &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; doing that would speak to your brand&amp;#8217;s integrity:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #222222;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 25px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can &lt;em&gt;never, ever &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;put your product on sale.&lt;/strong&gt; If it&amp;#8217;s an artisinal product why should you ever mark it down? This &lt;a href=&quot;http://forum.purseblog.com/handbags-and-purses/list-of-brands-that-never-go-on-sale-35118.html&quot;&gt;purse blog&lt;/a&gt; lists the brands of purses that never go on sale: Louis Vuitton and Hermes are among them. Could you imagine a Vuitton bag on sale? Me neither. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #222222;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 25px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can &lt;em&gt;refuse &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;to let the customer be right.&lt;/strong&gt; Toronto&amp;#8217;s famed Southern Italian restaurant &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.terroni.ca/&quot;&gt;Terroni &lt;/a&gt;has been widely criticized for refusing to cut pizza before serving, never putting parmesan cheese on certain types of pasta, and not letting customers have butter with their bread even though the kitchen has butter. They are authentically and staunchly Southern Italian and if you don&amp;#8217;t like it, you can go eat elsewhere. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #222222;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 25px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You could &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;play nice. &lt;/strong&gt;For years Coke and Pepsi had a battle of the brands. One would make an ad, the other would create a better ad, and so it went. Then in 1975 the gloves came off. Pepsi didn&amp;#8217;t want to play nice anymore.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi_Challenge&quot;&gt; The Pepsi Challenge&lt;/a&gt; was a way of taking the fight out of the ring and into the street where things could get a little messy.  Same thing with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpOvzGiheOM&quot;&gt;those clever Apple ads&lt;/a&gt;. They put PC front and centre and humiliated him. Not nice, but&lt;em&gt; man&lt;/em&gt; does it ever work. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: #222222;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 25px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   <updated>2010-04-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/2212</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2217&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/branding/2212/2212/attachment/screen-shot-2010-04-12-at-10-20-32-am&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2217&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-04-12 at 10.20.32 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-12-at-10.20.32-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;248&quot; height=&quot;271&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.leevalley.com/&quot;&gt;Lee Valley&lt;/a&gt; stores are a living example of how to do branding right. A trip to their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.leevalley.com/home/page.aspx?c=1&amp;amp;p=53697&amp;amp;cat=&quot;&gt;Downtown store &lt;/a&gt;embodies the power of living a single idea, simply expressed. Lee Valley sells high quality woodworking and gardening tools and that&amp;#8217;s all they sell. I had an impending kids&amp;#8217; birthday party on my mind as I roamed the aisles, and I was delighted to be &lt;em&gt;disappointed&lt;/em&gt; by the absence of kids&amp;#8217; stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lee Valley is not in the kids&amp;#8217; toys business. If fact they have a decidedly adult approach to craftsmanship.  The long-term benefit of being known for one thing outweighs the short term bang of selling a few cheap kids&amp;#8217; gardening or woodworking toys. In the must-read book &lt;a href=&quot;http://37signals.com/rework/&quot;&gt;Rework&lt;/a&gt;, the authors have a chapter dedicated to the importance of being a curator:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s the stuff you leave out that matters. So constantly look for things to remove, simplify and streamline&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s great advice for brands in general. How many messages are you trying to cram into a single ad? What are you talking about in your blog post? Why do people come to your store?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, &lt;a href=&quot;http://sethgodin.typepad.com/&quot;&gt;Seth Godin&lt;/a&gt; wrote a brilliant blog post about the appeal of artisanal products/services in response to decades of conspicuous consumption. The trend (hopefully it&amp;#8217;s not just a trend) is captured by Godin saying it&amp;#8217;s all about &amp;#8220;spending on and investing in &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;, not stuff.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes *time *and frankly love to curate. Not being able to curate is like being a hoarder. You&amp;#8217;re so afraid to let go. Why?  Because you&amp;#8217;re afraid to fail. What if someone shows up and I don&amp;#8217;t have what they want? Guess what, that&amp;#8217;s good news. As the Rework Authors state&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#8217;t make a great museum by putting all the art in the world into a single room. That&amp;#8217;s a warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t be a warehouse. A warehouse is generic, difficult to navigate, and impossible to be emotionally connected to. Here are a few examples of folks who have succeeded by curating, focusing and bringing lightening precision to their passionate endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2216&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/branding/2212/2212/attachment/screen-shot-2010-04-12-at-10-20-55-am&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2216&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-04-12 at 10.20.55 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-12-at-10.20.55-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;237&quot; height=&quot;317&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogto.com/cafes/cherrybomb&quot;&gt;Cherry Bomb&lt;/a&gt; in Roncesvalles. They just serve awesome coffee and biscotti and get people to line up out the door.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedrakehotel.ca/dgs&quot;&gt;The Drake General Store &lt;/a&gt;Their idea of vintage and modern whimsy is so clear, they opened a store in Rosedale where there&amp;#8217;s no Drake Hotel in sight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://sethgodin.typepad.com/&quot;&gt;Seth Godin&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s blog offers single idea marketing tips that help people stand out, not &amp;#8216;fit in&amp;#8217;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blomedry.com/&quot;&gt;Blo Bar&lt;/a&gt; No colour, no cuts, not even trained hairstylists. Just a blowdry for $35. I like it&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Smell the Insanity</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/2189/"/>
   <updated>2010-04-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/2189</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve noticed a strange trend in scented products&amp;#8211;the scent itself  actually bears no connection to its name.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.febreze.com/en_US/producttype/febreze_air_effects.do&quot;&gt;Febreze Air Effects &lt;/a&gt;has product names that are frankly off the hook. They range from the odd to the utterly absurd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2196&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/branding/2189/2189/attachment/screen-shot-2010-04-06-at-4-51-59-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2196&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-04-06 at 4.51.59 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-06-at-4.51.59-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;199&quot; height=&quot;139&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;They have one air freshener called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.febreze.com/en_CA/products/febreze_air_effects_lavender_vanilla_comfort.do&quot;&gt;Lavender, Vanilla and Comfort&lt;/a&gt;.  Nestled beside the two other familiar &amp;#8220;natural&amp;#8221; scents (Lavender + Vanilla) one might think that the third is also a scent. *What exactly does comfort smell like? *Even worse is the one called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.febreze.com/en_CA/products/febreze_air_effects_linen_sky.do&quot;&gt;Linen + Sky&lt;/a&gt;. *Sky?? *I can&amp;#8217;t even begin to think about what the sky smells like? Is it different than the smell we currently call air? The same air this spray is supposed to freshen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today in the shower at the gym I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.live-clean.com/&quot;&gt;Live Clean &lt;/a&gt; Body Wash that was in the shower. It was supposed to smell like &lt;a href=&quot;http://well.ca/products/live-clean-moisturizing-body-wash_23206.html?well_id=c6dpsp4k2sl1masuj39hi2o2f4&quot;&gt;Fresh Water&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Fresh water? *What would that smell like?&lt;/em&gt; *Seaweed? The stuff that comes out of the tap? It turns out it smelled like the usual body soap you find at the gym&amp;#8211; a generic perfume smell meant to deodorize my sweaty body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2197&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/branding/2189/2189/attachment/screen-shot-2010-04-06-at-4-51-12-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2197&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-04-06 at 4.51.12 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-06-at-4.51.12-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;165&quot; height=&quot;195&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It is ironic that at a time when the sky is stinky and polluted, and the water is anything but fresh, we&amp;#8217;re being bombarded by smells that represent a longing for a kind of paradise lost. Doubly ironic is the fact that these air &amp;#8220;fresheners&amp;#8221; are putting toxins into the air in your home. In other words, the same stuff that makes the air and water polluted is intended to smell like something pure and natural.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a whole other level are Febreze&amp;#8217;s  &amp;#8216;exotic&amp;#8217; scents. I can almost live with scent names like the soon to be released &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.febreze.com/en_CA/products/febreze_air_effects_thai_dragon_fruit.do&quot;&gt;Thai Dragon fruit&lt;/a&gt; (&amp;#8220;inspired by the winding canals of Thailand&amp;#8221;), even though I&amp;#8217;ve been to Thailand, and can&amp;#8217;t recall that smell as a particularly pleasant one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2198&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/branding/2189/2189/attachment/screen-shot-2010-04-06-at-4-47-55-pm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2198&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-04-06 at 4.47.55 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-06-at-4.47.55-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;180&quot; height=&quot;151&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;But then (and brace yourself) consider whether you would like your house to smell like a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.febreze.com/en_CA/products/febreze_air_effects_brazilian_carnaval.do&quot;&gt;Brazilian Carnaval&lt;/a&gt;,  or worse, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.febreze.com/en_CA/products/febreze_air_effects_moroccan_bazaar.do&quot;&gt;Moroccan Bazaar.&lt;/a&gt; Can you imagine your house smelling like a Moroccan Bazaar? What would people think if your home smelled like a combination of camel, cigarettes, sweaty men and old wool?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the world supposedly gets smaller and we become one big happy global village (now I&amp;#8217;m wondering what would a global village smell like?) buying nick-nacks at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tenthousandvillages.ca/&quot;&gt;Ten Thousand Villages&lt;/a&gt; and listening to world music, I guess we want to indulge in world smells. We don&amp;#8217;t actually want to go to those places and meet those exotic people, we just want to smell pretend smells that are pretending to smell like them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the popularity of these exotic smells, I&amp;#8217;ve come up with my own list that I&amp;#8217;m planning to send to the folks at P&amp;amp;G:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Parkdale Alley&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  S &amp;amp; M Dungeon (Smell the Fear)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Farmer&amp;#8217;s daughter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Thrift Shop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Yurt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Shore Leave&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any of your own to add to the list? I&amp;#8217;d love to send them along.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2184&quot; href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/social-media-category/2160/following-hope/attachment/screen-shot-2010-04-05-at-11-53-13-am&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2184&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-04-05 at 11.53.13 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-05-at-11.53.13-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;214&quot; height=&quot;158&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Over a year ago, I reconnected with an old friend Leanne (actually my ex-ex-ex-boyfriend&amp;#8217;s sister) by discovering her &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.en.chatelaine.com/living-with-breast-cancer&quot;&gt;blog &lt;/a&gt;on Chatelaine&amp;#8217;s website. The first post I stumbled on was called &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.en.chatelaine.com/living-with-breast-cancer/losing-it/&quot;&gt;Losing It&lt;/a&gt; and chronicled Leanne&amp;#8217;s journey through hair loss as she battled breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have stayed with the blog, and with Leanne during her ferocious fight against cancer and I&amp;#8217;ve simultaneously watched an army of supporters rally to her side. These days her posts regularly receive upwards of 20 comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these commenters are her friends + family. Some of them are others battling cancer. But &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; of them are folks who stumbled onto the blog, and could never look back. Many comments start with the words &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ve been reading the blog for some time but haven&amp;#8217;t commented until now&amp;#8221; But those who have not had the good fortune of meeting Leanne face to face are no less dedicated to making sure she can one day say the words &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;and then one day the cancer was just gone.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent post called &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.en.chatelaine.com/living-with-breast-cancer/stop-the-ride-i-want-to-get-off/&quot;&gt;Stop the Ride I Want to Get Off &lt;/a&gt;in which Leanne rages against the cancer-treatment machine&amp;#8217;s inability to help her manage treatment outside the system attracted two posts from virtual strangers. One said &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;A lot of stranger-friends in the blogosphere are rooting for you!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221; and the other &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Another stranger reading your blog here&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221; both of which provided helpful, practical information about finding clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leanne&amp;#8217;s army of supporters have now mobilized around Leanne&amp;#8217;s Clinical Trial trials&amp;#8211;offering advice, support, sharing Leanne&amp;#8217;s anger and frustration.  After one of Leanne&amp;#8217;s posts outlining the lonely and overwhelming &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.en.chatelaine.com/living-with-breast-cancer/full-time-job/#comments&quot;&gt;full time job &lt;/a&gt;that is searching for clinical trails, one reader stood up and asked:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this sound odd, but is there anything Chatelaine can do? You’d think a media entity of that size could turn this into a larger story and effect your ability to get into a trial? If anyone from Chatelaine is reading this —chop chop. (Please).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are those who would claim that social media offers nothing more than the promise of weak bonds. To those people I would say the community that circled around Leanne demonstrates the best in humankind. At it&amp;#8217;s core, social media is just another human form of engagement that offers the possibility of &lt;em&gt;deep&lt;/em&gt; attachments. Like many of the people who read the site, I often check back several times a day to hear any updates about a woman who now is part of my daily life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re ever feeling cynical about the power of social media, or frankly about humanity in general, read &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.en.chatelaine.com/category/living-with-breast-cancer/&quot;&gt;Leanne&amp;#8217;s blog &lt;/a&gt;and watch as the friends who have circled around her have the pleasure of reading the post that says &amp;#8220;and one day the cancer was just gone.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The POM Cure.</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/the-pom-cure/"/>
   <updated>2010-03-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/the-pom-cure</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s face it, nowadays every product claims to contain antioxidants, phytonutrients or Omega3&amp;#8242;s. Terms like those seem to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foodproductiondaily.com/content/view/print/239202&quot;&gt;resonate with consumers&lt;/a&gt;, but it&amp;#8217;s becoming pretty hard to stand out among all of these health claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s where POM&amp;#8217;s advertising stands apart. They don&amp;#8217;t just say their juice is good for you, they basically tell you it&amp;#8217;s going to &lt;em&gt;save your life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2137&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-03-30 at 4.27.53 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Screen-shot-2010-03-30-at-4.27.53-PM-e1269985368728.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;410&quot; height=&quot;235&quot; /&gt;Apparently these ads were banned in UK for making health claims that research couldn&amp;#8217;t support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, POM spent tons of money coming up with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pomwonderful.com/about/pom-truth/backed-by-science?phpMyAdmin=f455d7a5ceddb40fde790e32abdc1b30&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; to support all of the health benefits of pomegranate juice. But, I say anybody who thinks juice is going to save their life needs more help than antioxidants alone can provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s put the issue pomegranate&amp;#8217;s health benefits aside. The fact is, POM&amp;#8217;s campaign is pure genius. The promise of cheating death bypasses all the fluffy stuff about being healthy and looking younger and cuts right to the chase. What&amp;#8217;s all this health/youth stuff about anyway? At it&amp;#8217;s core it&amp;#8217;s about cheating death. It&amp;#8217;s the elephant in the room that POM&amp;#8217;s not afraid to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;POM had the courage to say it like it is and stick its neck out. Even if they get their hand slapped, they are doing a great job of being themselves; bold, super-charged, unabashed and a bit saucy. Good on &amp;#8216;em.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Gasparro’s Has a Bone to Pick</title>

   <id>http://getpoole.com/gasparros-has-a-bone-to-pick</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2114&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-03-29 at 11.46.49 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Screen-shot-2010-03-29-at-11.46.49-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2010-03-29 at 11.46.49 AM&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; height=&quot;212&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mybutcher.ca/&quot;&gt;Vince Gasparro&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; is an unassuming, family-run butcher shop that looks pretty much like any other in downtown Toronto. Inside it&amp;#8217;s a busy place that is even more packed since CBC&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbc.ca/hereandnowtoronto/matt_galloway.html&quot;&gt;Matt Galloway&lt;/a&gt; once again publicly proclaimed his affection (this time in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.torontolife.com/magazine/2010/4/&quot;&gt;Toronto Life)&lt;/a&gt; for this local meat shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the middle of a bustling Saturday afternoon at Gasparro&amp;#8217;s I got into a conversation with the youngest son Nick about Twitter. My insistence that Gasparro&amp;#8217;s start using Twitter was met with Nick&amp;#8217;s resistance &amp;#8220;What do I need Twitter for?&amp;#8221; he asked to a store full of enthusiastic customers. My tongue-in cheek-answer was simple &amp;#8220;You know why you need to be on Twitter? Because &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sanagansmeatlocker.com/&quot;&gt;Sanagan&amp;#8217;s Meat Locker &lt;/a&gt;in Kensington Market is on &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/sanagans&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the conversation turned to the meat. Gasparro&amp;#8217;s claims to have grain fed, cage free chickens and all kinds of good quality meats. But, I was always stumped by the fact that their meat didn&amp;#8217;t have any familiar  brand name on it (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rowefarms.ca/&quot;&gt;Rowe Farm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kerrfarms.ca/&quot;&gt;Kerr Farms&lt;/a&gt;, etc) that I associate with quality, naturally raised meat. Truth be told, I&amp;#8217;ve always been a bit suspicious of Gasparro&amp;#8217;s claims because of this absence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The older brother Lino jumped in &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;You&amp;#8217;re a victim of marketed meat!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221; he said as the younger brother quickly ushered me to the meat locker. Now, I&amp;#8217;ve never been inside a meat locker before, and I must say I was quite stunned to find animals, some with their fur still on, hanging from their hooves waiting to be butchered. The brothers then explained that much of the meat at Gasparro&amp;#8217;s comes from their father&amp;#8217;s farm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hearing this on the heels of the &amp;#8220;What do I need Twitter for?&amp;#8221; question was particularly ironic. Apparently, there&amp;#8217;s an amazing story to tell at Gasparro&amp;#8217;s and I just caught this tip of it. But, most importantly, it seems the boys at Gasparro&amp;#8217;s have a needle they want to move in the world. When Lino said &amp;#8220;You&amp;#8217;ve a victim of marketed meat&amp;#8221; he was picking a fight&amp;#8211;and we &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; when our clients want to pick a fight. He was standing up and saying &amp;#8220;you think the only meat that&amp;#8217;s good is the one that says Rowe farm on it. I got good meat, and it doesn&amp;#8217;t say anything on it &amp;#8217;cause it comes from my dad&amp;#8217;s farm.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#8217;s right. He&amp;#8217;s got my attention. Now imagine how the boys at Gasparro&amp;#8217;s could be using social media to take their fight public. They could do things like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Show footage from the farm and talk about what make Gasparro&amp;#8217;s meat different&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  A view inside the meat locker and why it looks different from other Butcher shops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Rants about marketed meat and why it bugs them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Updates on the latest cuts available in the shop (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/themeathook&quot;&gt;A butcher shop in Brooklyn i&lt;/a&gt;s doing this on Twitter with great success)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Link to other link minded folks who are working against marketed meat&amp;#8211;even if it has a conscience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a bone to pick (pun-intended) then you&amp;#8217;ve got a story to share. Social media platforms are the best place for story telling because then the story can be shared, and attract followers who can transform your fight into a movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What needle do you want to move in the world? How are you going to galvanize an army to help you fight the good fight? How are you going to tell that story to avoid being misunderstood, or most importantly, ensure what you stand for is clear to those who would love you if you only told them.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What’s your Secret Sauce?</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2100&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-03-23 at 10.34.02 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Screen-shot-2010-03-23-at-10.34.02-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2010-03-23 at 10.34.02 PM&quot; width=&quot;170&quot; height=&quot;188&quot; /&gt;A couple weeks back I attended&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inc.com/&quot;&gt; Inc. Magazine&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/Inc?v=app_7146470109&quot;&gt;GrowCo Conference&lt;/a&gt; in Orlando Florida. Brilliant entrepreneurs, from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brooklynindustries.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/content.page/nodeID/21917c51-d4e2-4952-a75f-f22556d4ce91/&quot;&gt;Lexy Funk&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inc.com/column/street-smarts/&quot;&gt;Norm Brodsky&lt;/a&gt; took to the stage to share the knowledge and insights they gleaned from years of experience building successful companies. Why do they share what they know? Because when they share they become &lt;em&gt;experts&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same goes for social media like Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, etc.  All these platforms exist to enable better sharing. In a meeting earlier today I was reminded that many people are still reluctant to give away too much information because they are afraid that someone else will steal their idea. Steal their idea? I say: Hoarding knowledge is dead. Long live sharing! Long live experts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the idea of McDonalds  having a secret sauce just seems creepy and weird. And, by the way, the recipe for that oh -so-secret sauce &lt;a href=&quot;http://americanfood.about.com/od/keytipstechniques/r/secsauce.htm&quot;&gt;can be found online&lt;/a&gt; along with  the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www3.ns.sympatico.ca/mt-edward/cadbury.htm&quot;&gt;Caramilk secret&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.answerbag.com/q_view/14323&quot;&gt;KFC&amp;#8217;s eleven secret herbs and spices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2106&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-03-23 at 10.48.41 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Screen-shot-2010-03-23-at-10.48.41-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2010-03-23 at 10.48.41 PM&quot; width=&quot;236&quot; height=&quot;170&quot; /&gt;On the last day of the GrowCo Conference, I had the pleasure of listening to Jason Fried from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.37signals.com&quot;&gt;37 Signals&lt;/a&gt; give a talk on the need to rethink old ways of doing and thinking about business.  His new (brilliant and life-changing) book&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.ca/Rework-Jason-Fried/dp/0307463745&quot;&gt; Rework&lt;/a&gt; has a chapter dedicated to the importance of sharing. It&amp;#8217;s called Emulate Chefs. He asks why chefs like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mariobatali.com/&quot;&gt;Mario Batali &lt;/a&gt;write cookbooks filled with their recipes, and yet they aren&amp;#8217;t the least bit afraid that someone&amp;#8217;s going to buy their cookbook and open a restaurant next door.  Because, as the authors say in their signature plain-speak &amp;#8220;It just doesn&amp;#8217;t work like that.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of keeping their secret sauce a secret, businesses need to &amp;#8220;emulate famous chefs&amp;#8221; by asking themselves the questions in Fried&amp;#8217;s book:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you do? What are your recipes? What&amp;#8217;s your cookbook? What can you tell the world about how you operate that&amp;#8217;s informative, educational and promotional?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can articulate what your secret sauce, your eleven herbs and spices are, you too can be an expert&amp;#8211;write a book, have a prolific and well-trafficked blog, create a toolkit, take to the speaking circuit or just sell more of what you&amp;#8217;re already selling. As Fried says &amp;#8220;This is our cookbook. What&amp;#8217;s yours?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>When Not to use a Turkey Baster</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/when-not-to-use-a-turkey-baster/"/>
   <updated>2010-03-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/when-not-to-use-a-turkey-baster</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2091&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-03-22 at 11.03.43 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Screen-shot-2010-03-22-at-11.03.43-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2010-03-22 at 11.03.43 AM&quot; width=&quot;224&quot; height=&quot;179&quot; /&gt;There&amp;#8217;s an American food outpost in Paris called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thanksgivingparis.com/&quot;&gt;Thanksgiving&lt;/a&gt; where one can find all kinds of uniquely American processed  foodstuffs like Campbells Cream of Mushroom Soup and Goldfish crackers. An American journalist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chicagotribune.com/travel/sc-trav-0309-french-translation-20100309,0,1103780.story&quot;&gt;recently documented&lt;/a&gt; her visit to the store accompanied by two French neighbours who became  fascinated with all things American after watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1135503/&quot;&gt;Julie and Julia.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experience left the journalists&amp;#8217; French friends dumbfounded. At one critical moment the writer picks up a Turkey baster, an object heretofore unfamiliar to her friends, and she describes it as best she can. In response to her description, one friend responds: &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;For this in France, a lady would use a spoon.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This got me thinking about how technology has made the food system and food itself worse instead of better and how folks are returning to low-tech foods&amp;#8211;the produce aisle instead of all the stuff in boxes. Why use a turkey baster when a spoon would do just fine?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve found that there are many places where low-tech solutions far outshine high-tech ones. Places where email and a universe social media sites have left many useful manual tasks behind with alot of negative side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was recently at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inc.com/&quot;&gt;Inc. Magazine&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/Inc?v=app_7146470109&quot;&gt;GrowCo Conference &lt;/a&gt;where CEO and author &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whyiseveryonesmiling.com/author.html&quot;&gt;Paul Spiegelman&lt;/a&gt; talked about the importance of mailing hand-written notes to employees&amp;#8217; homes. He writes notes to thank people, to express condolences, etc. He keeps a stack of them on his desk at all times.  Paul&amp;#8217;s dedication to hand written notes reminded me of the benefits of keeping things low tech when trying dealing with valuable human interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is my hit list of high-tech human engagement tools that I think are far inferior to their low tech counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Facebook Birthday Alerts:&lt;/strong&gt; Remember when people used to call you on your birthday? You&amp;#8217;d come home to a voicemail box full of warm messages. Or, even better, a few coloured envelope stuffed into your mailbox. No number of facebook notes can replace that warm feeling. I wish facebook birthday alerts would just go away. If you don&amp;#8217;t know my birthday then don&amp;#8217;t bother. If you remember my birthday, give me a call.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Email Thank Yous: *&lt;/em&gt;In his &lt;a href=&quot;http://porkosity.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;FED column, Corey Mintz&lt;/a&gt; used to note whether his guests bothered to thank him and in what manner (email, phone call, note). Even though he didn&amp;#8217;t come right out and say it, I got the feeling (and maybe I&amp;#8217;m projecting) that email thank you&amp;#8217;s are his least favourite way to receive expressions of gratitude. I know we&amp;#8217;re all busy, but a personal thank you from a guest means the world. Someone cooked you a meal. Is a phone call too much to ask for?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;LinkedIn Invitations: *&lt;/em&gt;Nothing replaces meeting people face to face, having a glass of wine and breaking bread with them. Physically passing someone your business card with a smile will always be much more meaningful than hiding behind a computer monitor inviting people to join your list. LinkedIn has it&amp;#8217;s place, but don&amp;#8217;t ever mistake it as a substitute for going out and meeting people as a networking tool.&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Feeling Salty</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/feeling-salty/"/>
   <updated>2010-03-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/feeling-salty</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Knorr has reduced the sodium in many of its products. To announce the change they&amp;#8217;ve introduced a character named &amp;#8216;Salty&amp;#8217; into their ads and social media campaign. The ads are the personification of cuteness. Who could resist the moment when the salt pours out of his eyes in place of tears?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea to personify Salty and generate sympathy for him is really good. And the TV spots do a great job of being funny and original, and making something as mundane as salt reduction worth talking about at the water cooler. Kudos to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ddbcanada.com/noflash.html&quot;&gt;DDB Canada&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the social media department, Salty has posted some pretty awesome pictures of himself on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/SaltysLife&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, like his most recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=5118769&amp;amp;id=230396269151&amp;amp;fbid=364321149151&quot;&gt;Olympic adventure&lt;/a&gt; (so patriotic). The Facebook and Twitter campaigns called *SaltysLife *are intended to bring the tiny figure to life. The dedicated &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sidekicks.ca/sodium101.aspx&quot;&gt;Sidekicks sitelette &lt;/a&gt; invites us to &amp;#8220;Follow Salty on His Adventures.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, do I want to? What would I get by following or friending Salty?  A novel, funny ad does not easily translate into a solid or &amp;#8220;follow-worthy&amp;#8221; social media campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first contact with Salty was on Twitter when I noticed he was following me. When I checked out his Tweets, I found him very self-centered. Just links to Facebook pictures of him, some Knorr product and recipes. If I&amp;#8217;m going to follow someone on Twitter (even a fictional character) then I want that person to be fully dimensional. And, Twitter is the perfect medium for Salty to tell us what he&amp;#8217;s up to since he lost the Knorr gig and the stuff he cares about. Here are a few potential SaltysLife Tweets that would bring the little fellow to life in a funny, shareworthy way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Hydration is overrated people. Eat more salt!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Watching the Olympics live in Vancouver was no fun. Just alot of shoes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Got ice to melt? I&amp;#8217;m available!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that like all good Tweeters, Salty&amp;#8217;s Tweets need to be more useful and relevant. How? By sharing useful information about salt, even if it&amp;#8217;s laced with Salty&amp;#8217;s disappointment with the &amp;#8220;propaganda&amp;#8221; coming out against him. If I was Salty&amp;#8217;s social media mentor I&amp;#8217;d advise the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Link to important research about Salt, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://bigthink.com/ideas/18347&quot;&gt;this video by Marion Nestle&lt;/a&gt; (Salty Tweets  &amp;#8220;Who believes Marion Nestle anyway. What is she like an expert or something?&amp;#8221;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Talk about the health benefits of Pepper &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.squidoo.com/blackpepper&quot;&gt;like this article does &lt;/a&gt; (Salty Tweets &amp;#8220;Look at how my so-called-friend Pep is stealing the limelight&amp;#8221;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Highlight the health benefits of salt reduction (Salty Tweets &amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t act like you don&amp;#8217;t like bloat. Don&amp;#8217;t believe the hype about salt reduction&amp;#8221;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you go Salty, you&amp;#8217;re no longer jobless. Now you&amp;#8217;ve got your work cut out for you.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-2062 alignright&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-02-25 at 10.02.33 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Screen-shot-2010-02-25-at-10.02.33-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2010-02-25 at 10.02.33 AM&quot; width=&quot;187&quot; height=&quot;199&quot; /&gt;I found myself &lt;em&gt;starving *at Home Depot yesterday. I begrudgingly stepped up and ordered a veggie burger from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.harveys.ca/&quot;&gt;Harveys&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#8217;m 1/2 way thorough the phenomenal book &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eatinganimals.com/&quot;&gt;Eating Animals&lt;/a&gt;, which, if you&amp;#8217;ve read it you know&amp;#8211;it leaves no choice *but&lt;/em&gt; the veggie burger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main take-aways from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Safran_Foer&quot;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer&amp;#8217;s &lt;/a&gt;investigation of where our meat comes from is the absolute meaninglessness of language when it comes to food. As Foer says about the term &amp;#8220;free range:&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applied to meat, eggs, dairy and every now and then even fish&amp;#8230;the free-range label is bullshit. It should provide no more peace of mind than &amp;#8220;all natural,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;fresh,&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;magical.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standing in line listening to people order the Harvey&amp;#8217;s Angus burger, and watching those grey looking pucks get plunked on the grill,  it was dead obvious. Whatever Angus means, it couldn&amp;#8217;t mean much in the way of quality.  What does Angus mean in the context of factory farming? Well, it turns out it means absolutely nothing at all. As the blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://cheaphealthygood.blogspot.com/2008/09/angus-anguish-is-angus-beef-worth-money.html&quot;&gt;cheaphealthygood.com&lt;/a&gt; says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angus cattle are “the most popular beef breed of cattle in the U.S.” and fast food chains like Harvey&amp;#8217;s aren&amp;#8217;t &amp;#8221; serving the high-quality Certified Angus Beef. It’s just regular ol’ Angus beef, which hasn’t been proven to taste any better.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, given the meaninglessness of fast food language, I&amp;#8217;ve come up with a few terms of my own:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hows about* Anus beef? *&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ll have an anus burger please!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Um, &lt;em&gt;Anguish beef?&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8220;Two anguish burgers with cheese to go&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or a combo-platter. Anus-guish burger &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ll take the Anus-guish burger&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All good options, and frankly more meaningful, and truthful than the term Angus.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Church Signs: The Original Tweets</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/church-signs-the-original-tweets/"/>
   <updated>2010-02-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/church-signs-the-original-tweets</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-2050 alignright&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-02-23 at 1.29.59 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Screen-shot-2010-02-23-at-1.29.59-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2010-02-23 at 1.29.59 PM&quot; width=&quot;256&quot; height=&quot;339&quot; /&gt;Think about it.  Those backlit signs with the manually-applied characters that churches use to recruit parishioners are the original tweets. Today&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestar.com/living/religion/article/769966--the-gospel-according-to-church-signs&quot;&gt;Toronto Star&lt;/a&gt; profiles these signs featuring clever (under 140 character) proclamations like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;A Toyota&amp;#8217;s not the only thing that can be recalled by its maker&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Want to talk to God? Try &lt;em&gt;knee&lt;/em&gt; mail.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Remember, even Moses was a basket case once&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;!--more--&amp;gt;Fact is, those antiquated church signs can teach us alot about how to tweet, and frankly about how to communicate in general. Take note:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The churches aren&amp;#8217;t selling themselves:&lt;/strong&gt; The signs never say &amp;#8220;Come to our church&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;Check out our new pews&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;We have the tastiest wafers!&amp;#8221; Instead, they sell an idea—usually spirituality, church-going, etc. They&amp;#8217;re talking about something bigger than themselves. In this case, God, who supposedly is much, much bigger than us. Consider how many tweets are wasted talking about a new menu item, a sale or a new account. It&amp;#8217;s too inward-looking. Look out; waaaay outside yourself and talk about the bigger issues that matter to your communities of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;They have personality: *&lt;/em&gt;Some are witty, some are welcoming, some are really, really scary. The point is, each has a distinct flavor  that ideally reflects the values of the church it stands in front of. What&amp;#8217;s your personality and how do you express it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They are (often) shareworthy:&lt;/strong&gt; Brevity forces creativity. You&amp;#8217;ve got one shot, one sign, one message. Even though the medium is cheap,  a lot of thought goes into making an impact with a single church sign. I&amp;#8217;ve seen much pricier media buys that haven&amp;#8217;t had nearly as much impact as those signs. A tweet, or any piece of communication, is an opportunity to be talked about. It&amp;#8217;s not enough just to be provocative—you want people to say the right thing about you. So, what do you want them to say?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2034&quot; title=&quot;Picture 1&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Picture-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Picture 1&quot; width=&quot;267&quot; height=&quot;291&quot; /&gt;When we talk about social media, the newness of the medium often keeps us from remembering that the same old rules of communication apply. Say something. Stand for something. Be memorable. And do it in under 140 characters.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Johnson + Johnson apparently  invented bathtime</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/johnson-johnson-apparently-invented-bathtime/"/>
   <updated>2010-02-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/johnson-johnson-apparently-invented-bathtime</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-2028 alignright&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-02-22 at 12.04.21 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Screen-shot-2010-02-22-at-12.04.21-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2010-02-22 at 12.04.21 PM&quot; width=&quot;286&quot; height=&quot;185&quot; /&gt;Johnson + Johnson&amp;#8217;s new social media campaign tries to help moms by giving them helpful tools to put their babies to sleep. The dedicated &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnsonsbaby.com/Sleep/default.html&quot;&gt;sleep sitelet&lt;/a&gt; features videos on the key steps to get babies to sleep. But, there are some key &amp;#8216;What Not to Do&amp;#8221; tips that emerge from J+J&amp;#8217;s approach to the sleep videos:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Overproduced:&lt;/strong&gt; The videos are too slick. They look like they were shot in studio. This is the&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com&quot;&gt; youtube &lt;/a&gt;age. The drawback to being overproduced is you look corporate&amp;#8211;and not trustworthy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-2029 alignright&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-02-22 at 12.43.45 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Screen-shot-2010-02-22-at-12.43.45-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2010-02-22 at 12.43.45 PM&quot; width=&quot;291&quot; height=&quot;273&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;UnRealistic:&lt;/strong&gt; These babies are cooing and being adorable. Anyone who has ever bathed, massaged, or put a baby to bed knows their is nothing realistic about this picture. Babies writhe, resist, cry, fuss, giggle. It&amp;#8217;s not helpful to demonstrate putting a baby to sleep without showing these realities. And the moms? They are waaaay too calm, pleasant, pretty, coiffed. These folks need to come to my house for a healthy dose of what bedtime looks like (see photo for a purview into our calming bath ritual)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Branded: *&lt;/em&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sure the J+J folks are patting themselves on the back for creating a helpful spot that isn&amp;#8217;t pushing product. And yet, they are trying to brand an issue and approach that they &lt;em&gt;simply didn&amp;#8217;t&lt;/em&gt; invent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Johnson&amp;#8217;s, &lt;em&gt;the first and only brand&lt;/em&gt; with the first and only 3-step nighttime routine that&amp;#8217;s clinically proven to promote better sleep for babies and toddlers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please J+J. Stop trying so hard. Just be helpful, realistic and stop trying to get yourself in the picture. Just being helpful gives you the benefit of the halo effect, no need to make claims beyond that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online video can be great. And these videos are on a topic that is very relevant to new parents. The J&amp;amp;J  execution, however, is where it all goes down the drain.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Dove for Men: Do You Buy It?</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/dove-for-men-do-you-buy-it/"/>

   <id>http://getpoole.com/dove-for-men-do-you-buy-it</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-2023 alignright&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-02-18 at 10.56.41 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Screen-shot-2010-02-18-at-10.56.41-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2010-02-18 at 10.56.41 AM&quot; width=&quot;265&quot; height=&quot;195&quot; /&gt;Dove has launched a &lt;a href=&quot;http://content.dove.us/mencare/Default.aspx&quot;&gt;new men&amp;#8217;s line&lt;/a&gt;. Like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.campaignforrealbeauty.com/&quot;&gt;Dove&amp;#8217;s Real Beauty campaign&lt;/a&gt;, Dove&amp;#8217;s male targeted campaign seeks to challenge gender stereotypes&amp;#8211;this time taking on the external beauty pressures men face. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unilever.com/&quot;&gt;Unilever&lt;/a&gt; did the research and shared some interesting findings about male gender identity, including (from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestar.com/living/article/750927--dove-s-idea-of-real-beauty-to-include-average-joes&quot;&gt;Toronto Star&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  80 per cent of men in Canada believe they are falsely portrayed in the media – that the washboard abs, bulging pecs and ripped biceps so often featured in television and print ads do not reflect their pale, doughy reality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 21px;&quot;&gt;Men reject advertising that portrays the ideal man as rich, implausibly handsome and aggressively ambitious&amp;#8211; real men are more inclined to value their personality and sense of humour over money and possessions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 21px;&quot;&gt;To combat these stereotypes Dove created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuexzKkMIDc&quot;&gt;big, splashy ad &lt;/a&gt; called The Road to Comfort that launched during the Superbowl. It&amp;#8217;s a good spot targeted to men who are &lt;em&gt;at the stage of life &lt;/em&gt;where they are literally and figuratively comfortable in their own skin and want to abandon traditional ideas of male identity and embrace who they really are. The men&amp;#8217;s care products are targeted to men who are ok using male targeted cosmetic brands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 21px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2016&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-02-18 at 10.44.34 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Screen-shot-2010-02-18-at-10.44.34-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2010-02-18 at 10.44.34 AM&quot; width=&quot;192&quot; height=&quot;149&quot; /&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not the first to notice that Unilever, the same company who owns Dove, also owns Axe; the brand famous for promoting the Axe effect. Not sure what the Axe Effect is? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9tWZB7OUSU&quot;&gt;Check out this ad &lt;/a&gt;where women in bikinis run (with their breasts freely bouncing) from every corner of the globe, magnetically drawn to a man who is spraying himself with Axe fragrance. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 21px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;&quot;&gt;
  This kind of brand-hypocracy is not a new problem and it&amp;#8217;s a growing phenomenon as companies buy up more and more existing brands. Consider that Fair Trade chocolate brand &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greenandblacks.com/&quot;&gt;Green and Blacks&lt;/a&gt; is owned by processed foods giant &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.Kraftcanada.com&quot;&gt;Kraft.&lt;/a&gt; And that&amp;#8217;s just the tip of the iceberg.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 21px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;&quot;&gt;
  How do you feel about a multinational speaking out of both sides of its mouth? Is it hypocritical or do you feel it&amp;#8217;s better to use your dollars to vote for brands that carry positive social messages ?

   <title>An Open Letter to the Film Industry</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/an-open-letter-to-the-film-industry/"/>
   <updated>2010-02-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/an-open-letter-to-the-film-industry</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-2003&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-02-15 at 9.34.36 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Screen-shot-2010-02-15-at-9.34.36-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2010-02-15 at 9.34.36 PM&quot; width=&quot;324&quot; height=&quot;218&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Head of Big Movie Studio,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently you&amp;#8217;ve been doing alot (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lE9-W9JNjio&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded#at=25&quot;&gt;like making this ad&lt;/a&gt;) to help me see that pirating films is wrong because it&amp;#8217;s like stealing from the artists who worked so hard to made those movies. So, when I went to license a film for a fundraiser for my daughter&amp;#8217;s nursery school, I made sure I went through all the proper channels like paying $350 to show &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0451079/&quot;&gt;Horton Hears a Who&lt;/a&gt; to kids under 5 and their folks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you took $350 from a nursery school, it would have been really, really helpful if you would have told me what happens to the money. Because, when you told me that I could go rent the film to show it to the kids, I felt a little bit ripped off.  Like for $350 you couldn&amp;#8217;t mail me the film?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So then you mailed the movie to me. I searched the whole invoice envelope and there was nothing in there about where the money went. No pictures of the nice editors and stunt men who worked so hard to make the movie and deserved to be paid. Instead I received a whole long note telling me I had to pay to return the film, and another note all in caps (CAPS!!!) that said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THERE WILL BE  $2.00 PER DAY PER VIDEO/DVD LATE FEE FOR ALL MOVIES&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IN ADDITION CUSTOMERS MAY BE CHARGED FOR ANY LOST OR DAMAGED VIDEOS/DVDS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just want you to know that when you write in ALL CAPS I start to feel very bad inside. I start to feel that you&amp;#8217;re not very nice to me when all I&amp;#8217;m trying to do is raise a little money for some kids and support some artists along the way.  I suggest next time you tuck a little note in with the invoice that makes me feel good about what I&amp;#8217;m doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. If you were nicer, maybe less people would want to steal your stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.P.S. For some way better Anti-piracy ads check out this one from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LkWKvMCzqA&amp;amp;feature=related&quot;&gt;Jack Black&lt;/a&gt; and this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUhibKNxICM&amp;amp;feature=PlayList&amp;amp;p=FD6141D21E1658CF&amp;amp;playnext=1&amp;amp;playnext_from=PL&amp;amp;index=8&quot;&gt;killer ad from the UK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yours truly,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jodi (Pippa and Jayne&amp;#8217;s Mom) and social coordinator &lt;a href=&quot;http://myschoolcooperative.org/&quot;&gt;My School Cooperative Nursery &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Everything I Needed to Know I Learned on Twitter</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/everything-i-need-to-know-i-learned-on-twitter/"/>
   <updated>2010-02-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/everything-i-need-to-know-i-learned-on-twitter</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-1996&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-02-11 at 2.24.49 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Screen-shot-2010-02-11-at-2.24.49-PM1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2010-02-11 at 2.24.49 PM&quot; width=&quot;272&quot; height=&quot;169&quot; /&gt;There are many great resources to guide you in getting started on your Twitter career (Chris Brogan&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chrisbrogan.com/a-brief-and-informal-twitter-etiquette-guide/&quot;&gt;Twitter Etiquette Guide&lt;/a&gt; is a particularly good starter). Many of these guides help you by drawing the connection between real-life etiquette (e.g. cocktail party behaviour; introduce yourself, listen before speaking, etc.) and your Twitter life. But I&amp;#8217;m actually experiencing the reverse-there a few key things that Twitter has taught me about relationships and how to cultivate them that I didn&amp;#8217;t know before. In other words, Twitter has taught me lessons about life. I&amp;#8217;m going to use examples from &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/jodilastman&quot;&gt;my very own Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; to demonstrate what I&amp;#8217;ve learned since Twitter came to town:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Make others feel good about their successes:&lt;/strong&gt; I love hearing that someone&amp;#8217;s enjoyed a blog post I&amp;#8217;ve written or a link I&amp;#8217;ve shared. And because I know that, I&amp;#8217;m always delighted to be supportive of others. On Twitter you do it by ReTweeting (RTing),  replying to a post or DMing someone to say &amp;#8220;good job.&amp;#8221; In real life you do it by thanking people, complimenting them in front of others, or taking a quiet moment to tell them you&amp;#8217;ve noticed something they&amp;#8217;ve done well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Be Generous: *&lt;/em&gt;On occasion I throw a question up on Twitter like &amp;#8220;What&amp;#8217;s the story with the new Canada post mailboxes?&amp;#8221; I&amp;#8217;ve also used Twitter to put out a call for help like when I was searching for &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/blog/1865/fiesta-farms-video-shoot-1-meeting-nooria&quot;&gt;Grannies&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fiestafarms.ca&quot;&gt;Fiesta Farms&lt;/a&gt; website. People extend their generosity by answering the call. And I in turn do the same. This is the key to community building. And, it&amp;#8217;s just good karma. So now when someone randomly asks me if I can help them tear-down at an event I&amp;#8217;ve enjoyed being at, I lend a hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Be Open: *&lt;/em&gt;Meeting new people is fun. Following friends of friends of friends can lead to&amp;#8230;new friends. You never know what you might discover by following someone new. I follow &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chefgui.com/&quot;&gt;Gui Alinat &lt;/a&gt;(@chefgui) on Twitter. Gui is a French born chef who lives in Tampa, Florida. Don&amp;#8217;t ask me how I started following him. I couldn&amp;#8217;t tell you. I do know that the other night we were Tweeting about what we were eating when the rest of the world was watching the Superbowl and eating Chilli. I was eating Moules Frite and he was having &lt;em&gt;leftover&lt;/em&gt; Veal Cheeks (who has veal cheeks hanging around in their fridge?) and we were fast friends. I apply this to other events I go to. Someone may not look like your &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt;, but I&amp;#8217;ve met many great people by striking up a conversation and seeing where it goes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Be bold: *&lt;/em&gt;At an fundraising event the other night, I was annoyed that people were speaking over the charitable representative who was there to talk about the devastation in Haiti. I started typing a Tweet that was milder than I really felt about the situation. Than I thought screw it, I&amp;#8217;m going to say it the way I want to. I wrote &amp;#8220;When at a fundraiser you should be quiet when someone from the charity gets up to speak.&amp;#8221; Others agreed, and it was re-tweeted several times. Of course there are times, in the real world, when it makes sense to soft-pedal issues. But more often than not, people like you best when you take a clear stance on an issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter has enriched my life. It &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt;. It has introduced me to new people and a much more social way of being in the world. Unlike Facebook, where it&amp;#8217;s all about chatting with &amp;#8216;friends,&amp;#8217; building relationships with virtual strangers is tremendously educational and humbling. I&amp;#8217;m learning that there&amp;#8217;s still alot more to learn&amp;#8211;both online and off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What has social media like Twitter, Facebook, etc. taught you about life?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Mary Jane’s Farm: A Model of Community Building</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/mary-janes-farm-a-model-of-community-building/"/>
   <updated>2010-02-09T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/mary-janes-farm-a-model-of-community-building</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&amp;#8217;s news that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/magazine-sales-hit-hard-at-newsstands/article1460947/&quot;&gt;magazine sales at newsstands are plummeting&lt;/a&gt; across North America should come as no surprise to those who have seen traditional media like newspapers struggle to find their footing in the face of social media. Loyalty is hard to come by in the magazine world. Magazines are a discretionary purchase. Gum? hand sanitizer? magazine?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-1978&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-02-09 at 12.00.01 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Screen-shot-2010-02-09-at-12.00.01-PM1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2010-02-09 at 12.00.01 PM&quot; width=&quot;314&quot; height=&quot;156&quot; /&gt;So how to cultivate loyalty among a fickle readership. Give them something that resonates on a deep values level then they won&amp;#8217;t be fickle. They&amp;#8217;ll be devout.  That&amp;#8217;s exactly what &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maryjanesfarm.com/&quot;&gt;Mary Jane&amp;#8217;s Farm &lt;/a&gt;has done. Imagine a magazine where readers write in to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Thank you Mary Jane for reminding me what was most important in the world, who I wanted my daughters to grow up to be, and how I could return to my true self.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True Self. Wow. Imagine a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.luckymag.com/&quot;&gt;Lucky&lt;/a&gt; magazine reader saying that (ha!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary Jane&amp;#8217;s Farm is not just a magazine for famers or want-to-be farmers. It is for women, rural and city folk alike,  for whom the values of the farm resonate deeply. Basically those who believe in the values of homesteading&amp;#8211;be they NY corporate lawyers or stay at home moms in Idaho. In fact, one of the magazine&amp;#8217;s credos is &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s not where you live, but how you live.&amp;#8221; And they have four different bloggers; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maryjanesfarm.org/MJFBlog/&quot;&gt;city&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maryjanesfarm.org/RFBlog/&quot;&gt;rural&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://rfgblog.maryjanesfarm.org/&quot;&gt;ranch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfgblog.maryjanesfarm.org/&quot;&gt;suburban&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-1974&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-02-09 at 11.53.20 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Screen-shot-2010-02-09-at-11.53.20-AM1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2010-02-09 at 11.53.20 AM&quot; width=&quot;289&quot; height=&quot;282&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Mary Jane&amp;#8217;s Farm, no matter where you&amp;#8217;re from, you&amp;#8217;re part of their community if you subscribe to the following 5 core values:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Want to know where your food comes from&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Participate in its production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Care about family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Create community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Make something with your hands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his book Making Meaning, Nathan Shedroff points to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.makingmeaning.org/meanings.html&quot;&gt;15 core meanings&lt;/a&gt; that help create long lasting relationships with consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the primary ways Mary Jane&amp;#8217;s farm creates meaning for it&amp;#8217;s readers is through the value of community which Shedroff defines as &amp;#8220;a sense of unity with others around us and a general connection with other human beings.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s an awful lot of talk about the word community these days. Throw up a facebook fan page and &amp;#8220;*bam&amp;#8221; *you&amp;#8217;ve got a community. Those of us who have ever belonged to a community know it&amp;#8217;s about much more than pushing a button, or being a fan. It&amp;#8217;s about being a committed participant on a ritualized level. Think about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.harley-davidson.com/en_US/Content/Pages/home.html&quot;&gt;Harley Davidson &lt;/a&gt;devotees or those who follow the band &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phish.com/&quot;&gt;Phish &lt;/a&gt;from state to state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you speak to people&amp;#8217;s core values, you are not discretionary. You are core to their lives. As one Mary Jane&amp;#8217;s farm Facebook fan puts it &amp;#8220;I &lt;span style=&quot;color: #333333;&quot;&gt;pinched pennies to get this magazine coming this year.&amp;#8221; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary Jane&amp;#8217;s Farm leverages the power of their values based brand in several ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Content&lt;/strong&gt;: The magazine does not suck. It does not exploit its readers by overloading them with ads. Instead, it fills the magazine with useful content on subjects that matter to its community&amp;#8211;from preserving, to cast-iron recipes, to sharing quilting and profiles of subscribers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Farmgirl Sisterhood: *&lt;/em&gt;When you &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maryjanesfarm.org/farmgirl%2Dsisterhood/&quot;&gt;join the sisterhood&lt;/a&gt; you get a bunch of special perks like a newsletter and access to the online forum but you also get a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maryjanesfarm.org/farmgirl%2Dsisterhood/merit-badges.asp&quot;&gt;badge&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8211;the first of many you can earn for things like crocheting, community service, going green, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Real-Life Meetings: *&lt;/em&gt;The Farmgirl Sisterhood and Chapters get-togethers where all the members get together for a good &amp;#8216;ol time. I&amp;#8217;m dying to go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Lots More: *&lt;/em&gt;There are countless ways to engage with the Mary Jane&amp;#8217;s Farm brand. You can stay at their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maryjanesfarm.org/bb/&quot;&gt;B&amp;amp;B&lt;/a&gt;, get their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maryjanesfarm.com/booksandgifts.html&quot;&gt;books &lt;/a&gt; and other products like &lt;a href=&quot;http://shopping.maryjanesfarm.org/s.nl/sc.2/category.23/.f&quot;&gt;sewing patterns,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rockymtncuts.com/maryjanes/&quot;&gt;organic beef, &lt;/a&gt;etc. watch &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maryjanesfarm.org/video-library.asp&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;Farm U&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; videos and that&amp;#8217;s just the tip of the iceberg. Seriously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you do something that is authentic and resonates on a values level a community forms around your brand. A Twitter feed or Facebook page means little if an emotional chord isn&amp;#8217;t being struck. Would people pinch pennies to afford your product? Would they want to chat with others who also buy your product? Would they want to sleep in your B &amp;amp; B if you had one? Would they want to wear your badge?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the definition of community. As the Mary Jane&amp;#8217;s Farm girls might say, the rest is &lt;em&gt;hogwash.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Fiesta Farms Video #5: Meeting Jessie</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/cl/"/>
   <updated>2010-02-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/cl</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1929&quot; title=&quot;Jessie&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Jessie-210x130.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Jessie&quot; width=&quot;210&quot; height=&quot;130&quot; /&gt;On Friday Jessie made us real Jamaican &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackee_and_saltfish&quot;&gt;Akee and Salt Fish&lt;/a&gt;. It was fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One particularly interesting thing about meeting Jessie (especially since this was the last webisode&amp;#8211;for now), was that she was part of the WTN cooking show &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lovingspoonfuls.com/&quot;&gt;Lovin&amp;#8217; Spoonfuls &lt;/a&gt;that aired in the early 2000&amp;#8242;s. Hosted by fabulous &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myspace.com/thedavidgale&quot;&gt;David Gale&lt;/a&gt;, the show was a definite inspiration to us as we considered how to bring &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fiestafarms.ca&quot;&gt;Fiesta Farms&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216; ethnic dimension (it&amp;#8217;s history and product) to life on the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lovin&amp;#8217; Spoonfuls focused on grandmothers and their recipes. And, like the Fiesta Farms series, it featured grannies from around the world. In the episode that featured Jessie, she  made &lt;a href=&quot;http://lovingspoonfuls.com/PAGES/REVISED_RECIPES/jessiesalmonrecipe.html&quot;&gt;Peas and Rice, Jerk Chicken and Christmas Cake&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;size-thumbnail wp-image-1939 aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-02-08 at 4.34.38 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Screen-shot-2010-02-08-at-4.34.38-PM2-210x130.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2010-02-08 at 4.34.38 PM&quot; width=&quot;210&quot; height=&quot;130&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plainly said, Lovin&amp;#8217; Spoonfuls was way (way, way, way) ahead of it&amp;#8217;s time. As producer Allan Niven says about the grandmothers in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDHs0SCpgaI&quot;&gt;story of Lovin Spoonfuls&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are people who are not often portrayed on television. The tend to be seen as irrelevant&amp;#8230;they were really not portrayed for who they are, which is people with a real body of experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember now, Lovin&amp;#8217; Spoonfuls &lt;em&gt;predated&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, it came &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the mass democratization of video content. Before YouTube, there were only 2 kinds of video you could watch in your living room; video filmed professionally (TV, film, etc.) that tended to include rather conventional characters,  and home movies which only you could see, in the privacy of your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course YouTube and other sites like Vimeo have made the line between professional and home movies virtually invisible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays anyone with a Flip or an iphone can make a movie that anybody can watch in their living room. And, like everyone else, seniors now have new opportunities to express themselves online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1928&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-02-08 at 2.14.17 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Screen-shot-2010-02-08-at-2.14.17-PM-210x130.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2010-02-08 at 2.14.17 PM&quot; width=&quot;210&quot; height=&quot;130&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you seen the Ottawa version of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeR2BZYT7gM&quot;&gt;Raging Grannies taking on Stephen Harper?&lt;/a&gt; Or the original &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oNWi8fXOfg&quot;&gt;Raging grannies &lt;/a&gt;slamming CBS for running pro-life ads on the Superbowl? Well, say no more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few Grannys whose cooking has taken the internet by storm:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  [Clara&amp;#8217;s Depression Era Cooking][10] where Clara cooks affordable food and tells stories from the Depression era&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-s1bkr8iPM&quot;&gt;Feed Me Bubbe&lt;/a&gt; Kosher cooking set to Klezmer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH6nuHcVwgg&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded#&quot;&gt;Geriatric 1927:&lt;/a&gt; Peter Oakley&amp;#8217;s response to Gordon Ramsey&amp;#8217;s Cookalong (watch for the nose picking)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are actually fewer seniors cooking shows than I would have imagined. Perhaps that&amp;#8217;s because not enough have access to the &amp;#8220;means of production&amp;#8221;&amp;#8211; your basic video camera. It&amp;#8217;s incumbent upon younger folks to film their grannies, bubbes, Omas doing their thang. As we all know, when these folks go, their recipes often go with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know of other great seniors&amp;#8217; cooking shows? I&amp;#8217;d love to hear about &amp;#8216;em.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Fiesta Farms Video #4: Meeting Oma (Wanda)</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/fiesta-farms-video-4-meeting-oma-wanda/"/>
   <updated>2010-02-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/fiesta-farms-video-4-meeting-oma-wanda</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1907&quot; title=&quot;Bisto&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Bisto-210x130.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bisto&quot; width=&quot;210&quot; height=&quot;130&quot; /&gt;I spent the day with my friend Arlene Stein&amp;#8217;s Oma; a woman from the Alsace Loire region of France (right at the border of Germany). She prepared an amazing stuffed beef dish called&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rouladen&quot;&gt; Rouladen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early on I noticed that Oma used a product called Bisto in almost everything she made. She mixed the white powder with flour and water and &lt;em&gt;presto&lt;/em&gt;, she had gravy. Oma was clearly taken by the stuff. She remarked &amp;#8220;look it&amp;#8217;s white, but when you add water it&amp;#8217;s brown.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought that Bisto must be some obscure find from a European deli. But, no. It appears that Bisto is a massive phenomenon. Bisto just celebrated its 100th anniversary and dominates the British grocery market. Bisto is so big in fact that it&amp;#8217;s entered the nomenclature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type Bisto into Twitter and you get results like this one. &amp;#8220;How&amp;#8217;s life anyway hun?&amp;lt;&amp;lt; all gravey like Bisto&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My perception of Bisto as an old lady brand was further shattered by my realization that they have an absolutely kick-ass social media campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ads like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r04L1K1Vycw&amp;amp;NR=1&quot;&gt;this one from the 80&amp;#8242;s &lt;/a&gt;show that Bisto has always been positioned as part of the family. Now Bisto has taken it one step further by taking on the issue of family meal time. For years experts have espoused the importance of families eating together, but realities often get in the way. Bisto asks families to work hard to eat together at least one night a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The campaign kicked off with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRELtJQrYyA&amp;amp;feature=related&quot;&gt;moving ad campaign&lt;/a&gt; focusing on the value of family meal time. The campaign&amp;#8217;s significant social media component lives on the dedicated &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aahnight.co.uk/&quot;&gt;ahh Night website&lt;/a&gt;. The website engages visitors by highlighting the issue and the benefits of family meal time; A Bisto sponsored study revealed how rarely British folk eat as a family (less than 1/3 do it once a week). It also highlights information from a respected psychologist about why family dinners are vital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1912&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-02-05 at 9.32.14 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Screen-shot-2010-02-05-at-9.32.14-PM-210x130.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2010-02-05 at 9.32.14 PM&quot; width=&quot;210&quot; height=&quot;130&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, the site engages families in making a change by asking them to take 3 simple steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Download and sign a “contract” pledging to eat dinner together one night per week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Send family or friends an email invitation to dinner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Make a delicious meal (recipes provided) using – you guessed it – Bisto.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#8217;ve signed up, you receive regular tips to help your family stay the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes this social media campaign such a good one for Bisto?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Right Fit:&lt;/strong&gt; If fits with their brand; Family and food is what Bisto has always stood for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Relevant:&lt;/strong&gt; Family meal time is a real issue that need to be addressed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Useful: *&lt;/em&gt;The simple tools and information help families make the change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Do-able: *&lt;/em&gt;They are asking people to pledge one night a week. And the they make the process of engaging simple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;About the Issue: *&lt;/em&gt;Sure Bisto does (at the end of the day) promote recipes made with the stuff, but really, it&amp;#8217;s about the issue, not Bisto&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you have it. Cooking with Oma turned out to be about much more than old world cooking. It lead me to discover a pretty cutting edge social media campaign. Truth is, campaigns this good make their own gravy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks Wanda. Tomorrow, I meet Jessie and her daughter Nicole from Jamaica.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Fiesta Farms Video Shoot #3: Meeting Zahra</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/fiesta-farms-video-shoot-3-meeting-zahra/"/>
   <updated>2010-02-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/fiesta-farms-video-shoot-3-meeting-zahra</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1897&quot; title=&quot;Rice1&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Rice1-210x130.png&quot; alt=&quot;Rice1&quot; width=&quot;210&quot; height=&quot;130&quot; /&gt;I spent today with Zahra who cooked up a fabulous Iranian dish &lt;a href=&quot;http://persian-food.suite101.com/article.cfm/persian_food_recipes&quot;&gt;Zeresh Polo&lt;/a&gt;. While myself, Eamonn and Marc are always very focused on shooting, as soon as the smell of saffron and onions started wafting through the kitchen, we were ready to eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zahra&amp;#8217;s cooking was not only delicious but incredibly vibrant. The ingredients were chosen for their flavour and for the visual dimension they bring to the dish; green pistachios, bright orangy-yellow saffron, and bright red dried berries. When Zahra finished preparing her rice dish, I questioned whether I&amp;#8217;d ever eat plain brown rice slopped in a bowl again. Her rice was a piece of art. And as she told us, each person adds their own flourishes to the dish to make it look just &amp;#8216;so.&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;

In the blog, Meagan pairs her love of visual art with her love of cooking. And the results are mouth watering. Check out her &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feastingonart.com/2010/02/vollons-parmesan-mustard-shortbread.html&quot;&gt;latest pairing&lt;/a&gt;; a sensual painting of a mound of butter by Antoine Vollon and a recipe for parmesan mustard shortbread (Oh my god!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooking with Zahra was also a lovely pairing; a warm and friendly home, and delicious beautiful food to match. Thanks Zahra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomrrow, I meet my friend Arlene&amp;#8217;s Oma Wanda. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Fiesta Farms Video Shoot #2: Meeting Mafalda and Clara</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/fiesta-farms-video-shoot-2-meeting-mafalda-and-clara/"/>
   <updated>2010-02-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/fiesta-farms-video-shoot-2-meeting-mafalda-and-clara</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1877&quot; title=&quot;Clara&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Clara-210x130.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Clara&quot; width=&quot;210&quot; height=&quot;130&quot; /&gt;Today, I had the pleasure of meeting Clara and Mafalda; an Italian Toronto mother and daughter who allowed us to video them making stuffed artichokes for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fiestafarms.ca&quot;&gt;Fiesta Farms website. &lt;/a&gt; They were warm, and lovely, and had an amazing rapport that had us all in stitches. Again, we were served an amazing lunch and even a glass of white wine. What a life I&amp;#8217;m living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the second time in two days of shooting, I was surprised to walk into the home of a supposed &amp;#8220;granny&amp;#8221; to discover that her home was more stylish than my own. When I think of a  &amp;#8220;granny&amp;#8221;, I think of my own grandmother whose house overflowed with chachkas, photographs and old fashioned, wood trimmed furniture. Clara&amp;#8217;s home did not stink of moth balls. In fact, she had all the latest modern stainless steel appliances and a television set bigger than I&amp;#8217;ve ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1889&quot; title=&quot;granny&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/granny-210x130.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;granny&quot; width=&quot;210&quot; height=&quot;130&quot; /&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know why I&amp;#8217;m surprised. My 60 and 70-something parents are pretty hip and live in a swanky condo. It seems &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/chicago/house-tours/heather-spriggs-vintage-granny-chic-097198&quot;&gt;granny chic &lt;/a&gt;is only the rage for us 40 somethings who only have faint memories of plastic covered furniture and giant coloured glass ashtrays from our own grandparents. Here&amp;#8217;s some evidence of the fact that granny chic is a real, and growing trend:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Flickr&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/groups/granny_chic/&quot;&gt;granny chic page&lt;/a&gt; has over 1,500 photos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.etsy.com&quot;&gt;Etsy, t&lt;/a&gt;he three year old online craft store sold $27 million in goods last year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Popular blogs like &lt;a href=&quot;http://decor8blog.com/&quot;&gt;decor8 &lt;/a&gt;are bringing granny chic to a whole new level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What to make of our longing for our grandmother&amp;#8217;s aesthetic?  If 60 is the new 40, then 40-somethings are missing the ol&amp;#8217; fashioned comfort of their granny&amp;#8217;s house. All those Lululemon-ed grannys are making us nostalgic for the feel of fur coats and a Chanel Number 5. If I were a psychologist, I&amp;#8217;d say we&amp;#8217;re filing that void by decorating our homes with nostalgic reminders of time gone by. Oh Granny, where art thou?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Fiesta Farms Video Shoot #1: Meeting Nooria</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/fiesta-farms-video-shoot-1-meeting-nooria/"/>
   <updated>2010-02-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/fiesta-farms-video-shoot-1-meeting-nooria</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1868&quot; title=&quot;Nooria&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Nooria-210x130.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Nooria&quot; width=&quot;210&quot; height=&quot;130&quot; /&gt;We&amp;#8217;re producing 6 videos for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fiestafarms.ca&quot;&gt;Fiesta Farms&amp;#8217;s website&lt;/a&gt;, each featuring an older person from a different ethnic background cooking a traditional dish. The videos will be rolled out over the next 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#8217;m the lucky gal who gets to meet all of these amazing people and interview them for the Fiesta Farms webisodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I had the pleasure of meeting Nooria, who welcomed us into her Mississauga home and cooked up 2 kinds of dumplings; one meat, one veggie. Not only did she let us invade her space for 5 hours, but she served us an amazing lunch and sent us on our way with take out containers full of incredible food. She and her husband even packed up the nuts that were on the table because they saw how much we enjoyed them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: left; border: 0px initial initial;&quot; title=&quot;Nooria2&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Nooria2-210x130.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Nooria2&quot; width=&quot;210&quot; height=&quot;130&quot; /&gt;Nooria is a part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.awcg.org/&quot;&gt;Afghan Women&amp;#8217;s Catering Group&lt;/a&gt;, a collective that was established in 1997 to help underemployed Afghani women gain the skills and income they need when they first arrive in Toronto. Now the group is incredibly successful; serving up samosas, kabobs, and less familiar dishes like the dumplings Nooria made for us today. The catering collective is not only a model of economic development, they make amazing food that is a huge hit meetings and events all across the GTA. Don&amp;#8217;t believe me? Check out one &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chowhound.chow.com/topics/329484&quot;&gt;Chowhound reviewer&amp;#8217;s positive comments. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re tired of serving soggy sandwiches and cold wraps at business meetings, I suggest you give the catering group a call. If Nooria&amp;#8217;s cooking is any indication, brace yourself for food that is  fresh, unique and truly delicious. Better food makes for better meetings? Didn&amp;#8217;t your grandmother tell you that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, I love my job!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow: Clara, our Italian chef making stuffed artichokes.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Bottling the Thrill of Thrifting</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/bottling-the-thrill-of-thrifting/"/>
   <updated>2010-02-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/bottling-the-thrill-of-thrifting</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-1843&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-02-01 at 11.40.41 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Screen-shot-2010-02-01-at-11.40.41-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2010-02-01 at 11.40.41 AM&quot; width=&quot;307&quot; height=&quot;362&quot; /&gt;What is the magical mix of elements that makes thrifting such an exciting pastime? Why do I find myself turning my steering wheel toward &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.valuevillage.com/&quot;&gt;Value Village &lt;/a&gt;when I&amp;#8217;m supposed to be going to the gym? Why do my friend and I give Olympic worthy-focus to scouring tiny thrift shops tucked into Buffalo church basements&amp;#8211;so much so that we&amp;#8217;re content to eat our lunches in the car en route to the next stop?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone could bottle the thrill of thrifting, they could make a fortune. Value Village has literally hitched it&amp;#8217;s wagon to the thrifting-set. While VV is *not *owned by Walmart (a nasty rumour) it is owned by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.savers.com/&quot;&gt;Savers&lt;/a&gt;, a 200+ for-profit American chain that is owned by the private equity investment firm of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freemanspogli.com/&quot;&gt;Freeman Spogli and Company.&lt;/a&gt; And, obviously &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ebay.com&quot;&gt;ebay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.craigslist.org&quot;&gt;craigslist &lt;/a&gt;understand, and benefit from, the psychology of thrifting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the unique *Eau De Thrift? *Can it be bottled and reproduced in other shopping experiences? * *Well, not literally. If you&amp;#8217;ve ever walked into a thrift store there&amp;#8217;s a distinct odour that hits you at the door. For me it&amp;#8217;s like a welcome mat. But I wouldn&amp;#8217;t call it pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the psychology of thrifting that makes it so appealing? Here&amp;#8217;s my preliminary list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#8217;s Meditative:&lt;/strong&gt; Flipping through racks of random objects is downright meditative. Bill and Susan&amp;#8217;s 10th Anniversary mug is stationed right beside a valuable Wedgewood tea cup.  And there&amp;#8217;s no price-tag guilt to distract you from your zen-like state. The only thing to focus on is; Do I like it? Can I use it? (or can my friend use it?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;There&amp;#8217;s the Thrill of the find: *&lt;/em&gt;In her article &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.walletpop.com/blog/2008/01/17/the-psychology-of-thrifting-its-about-more-than-saving-money/&quot;&gt;The Psychology of Thrifting &lt;/a&gt;Beth Wechsler says &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s no different than the bell that rings when the slot machine lines up just right and the coins come scrambling down.&amp;#8221; And once you&amp;#8217;ve scored a find, you&amp;#8217;re entitled to bragging rights (you: nice sweater! me: Thanks. $5 bucks at Value Village)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Nostalgia: *&lt;/em&gt;Like &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_Lost_Time&quot;&gt;Proust&amp;#8217;s Madeleine,&lt;/a&gt; there are memories embedded in those objects. Even if they&amp;#8217;re not my memories, these objects came from somewhere and carry a story. That tiny wall mount soap dish I found in Buffalo? I&amp;#8217;m fascinated with who owned it (was it a little old lady? a hotel?) It&amp;#8217;s pre-owed status just adds to it&amp;#8217;s appeal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Doing-Good: *&lt;/em&gt;Thrifting doesn&amp;#8217;t hurt your pocketbook or the world. There&amp;#8217;s really nothing to feel bad about to get in the way of all the good stuff. The objects are pre-used so no new resources went into making them. It&amp;#8217;s recycling. And, many thrift stores are not-for-profit. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goodwill.org/&quot;&gt;Goodwill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.salvationarmyusa.org/usn/www_usn_2.nsf&quot;&gt;Salvation Army&lt;/a&gt; (we pros call Sally-Ann) are their own non-profit organizations, while other thrift shops donate all their money to charitable causes like AIDS, abused women, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: left; border: 0px initial initial;&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-02-01 at 12.33.21 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Screen-shot-2010-02-01-at-12.33.21-PM-210x130.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2010-02-01 at 12.33.21 PM&quot; width=&quot;210&quot; height=&quot;130&quot; /&gt;Who&amp;#8217;s Bottling the Thrill of Thrifting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several retail stores have created shopping experiences that try to mimic some aspects of the thrifting experience. But few can replicate the entire psychological experience without selling actual thrift items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Meditative:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/&quot;&gt;Urban Outfitters&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.anthropologie.com&quot;&gt;Anthropologie&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s eclectic offerings (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?itemdescription=true&amp;amp;itemCount=10&amp;amp;startValue=1&amp;amp;selectedProductColor=&amp;amp;sortby=&amp;amp;id=17230608&amp;amp;parentid=A_FURN_WALL&amp;amp;sortProperties=+subCategoryPosition,+product.marketingPriority,-product.startDate&amp;amp;navCount=15&amp;amp;navAction=poppushpush&amp;amp;color=&amp;amp;pushId=A_FURN_WALL&amp;amp;popId=APARTMENT_FURNISH&amp;amp;prepushId=&quot;&gt;Squirrel and Fox Wall Art&lt;/a&gt; anyone?) are made for people who like to search through gobs of stuff to find a prize. But that prize won&amp;#8217;t be cheap, and it won&amp;#8217;t feel good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Thrill of the Find: *&lt;/em&gt;Obviously places like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.walmart.com&quot;&gt;Walmart &lt;/a&gt;or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.winners.ca/en/index.asp&quot;&gt;Winners&lt;/a&gt; offer bargains that can make your head spin and give you bragging rights. But, again, they have that Made in China feeling that is a definite buzz kill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very, very few retailers can offer two essential ingredients to thrifting ; Nostalgia and Doing-good. Despite best efforts, these products always feel like empty commodities mass manufactured in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracking Down the Scent: Kiosk Kiosk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One shop that comes closest to capturing the magical &lt;em&gt;Eau de Thrifting&lt;/em&gt; is New York based &lt;a href=&quot;http://kioskkiosk.com/&quot;&gt;KioskKiosk&lt;/a&gt;. Kiosk Kiosk&amp;#8217;s website offers an eclectic bunch of finds from a given country for a limited period of time. And then, they move to the next country. So, like thrifting the opportunity is time-sensitive. Right now they&amp;#8217;re featuring Portugal on their site. And, as someone who lives in Toronto&amp;#8217;s Little Portugal, I can tell you, it&amp;#8217;s a pretty wacky place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the items currently on the site is a g&lt;a href=&quot;http://kioskkiosk.com/c/108/p/1162/Bordallo_Pinheiro_Goat_Toothpick_Holder&quot;&gt;oat toothpick holder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://kioskkiosk.com/c/108/p/1218/Donkey_Playing_Cards&quot;&gt;donkey playing cards, &lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://kioskkiosk.com/c/108/p/1236/Pica_Pau_Wood_Glue&quot;&gt;wood glue&lt;/a&gt;,  and&lt;a href=&quot;http://kioskkiosk.com/c/108/p/1190/Sampling_of_Tinned_Fish_by_Tricana&quot;&gt; tinned fish&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s not just the objects on the site that create this effect. It&amp;#8217;s how they are presented. They use courier font, only show one object in totally random order (there are no product catagories) and every object is photographed in a unique and often bizarre setting. The let&amp;#8217;s run Kiosk Kiosk through our *Eau de Thrifting *checklist, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Meditative? *&lt;/em&gt;Check. The utter randomness of objects on the site will leave you mezmerized. As you flip through the web page, each object is transformed from a kalidesope-esque image into a photograph. This is clearly deliberate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Thrill of the Find? *&lt;/em&gt;Check. Where else would you find such a random range of objects in one place? And most items are well under $50.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Nostalgia? *&lt;/em&gt;Check. Even though these items are new, they do carry an aura with them. It is the aura of another culture. Of someone&amp;#8217;s grandmother, but it&amp;#8217;s an aura nonetheless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Do-Good? *&lt;/em&gt;Well&amp;#8230;.. I realize that some of these objects may be made in far away places that are not Portugal (perhaps China, but I don&amp;#8217;t think so). I realize they are not pre-loved by other human beings that would qualify their purchase as recycling. Their purchase does not raise money for people in need. But, this is about &lt;em&gt;perception&lt;/em&gt; people. The authenticity of these exotic objects keeps them from feeling like commodities. I say &amp;#8216;check.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there any spots you think qualify for the &lt;em&gt;Eau de Thrifting&lt;/em&gt;? I&amp;#8217;d love to hear about them. Or, even better, great Thrift stores in Toronto, Buffalo or well&amp;#8230;.no more than 2 hours drive. 2 hours is reasonable to go for an experience like this.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>War is Good for Absolutely Everything (When it comes to Marketing)</title>

   <updated>2010-01-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/war-is-good-for-absolutely-everything-when-it-comes-to-marketing</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-1804&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-01-28 at 11.07.31 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Screen-shot-2010-01-28-at-11.07.31-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2010-01-28 at 11.07.31 AM&quot; width=&quot;292&quot; height=&quot;96&quot; /&gt;Sundance Film Festival opened with a screening of &lt;a href=&quot;http://sundance.bside.com/2010/films/howl_sundance2010&quot;&gt;Howl &lt;/a&gt;based on renowned maverick poet &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Ginsberg&quot;&gt;Allen Ginsberg&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s famous poem. Selecting this film and it&amp;#8217;s notably anti-conformist subject was a calculated move for the Festival which is taking the opportunity to position Sundance as the Anti-Hollywood, Anti-Blockbuster Festival.  As the Toronto Star reported,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The battle slogan was ordered by Redford himself: &amp;#8220;Fight Against The Establishment of the Expected. This Is the Rebirth of the Battle for Brave New Ideas.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economic downturn has left the indie-film industry fighting for it&amp;#8217;s life. So, Sundance has stood up and declared it&amp;#8217;s mission to create an Army of indie devotees. As Redford says &amp;#8220;It might be a small army, but I hope it&amp;#8217;s a big army.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The army metaphor has become a big trend in communications. The new message is kick cancer&amp;#8217;s, AIDS&amp;#8217;, Autisms&amp;#8217; ass. And it&amp;#8217;s consistent with the &amp;#8216;me&amp;#8217; generation&amp;#8217;s approach to getting things done. Anyone remember the much-maligned &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.charmaineyoest.com/2006/11/army_marketing_army_strong_but.php&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;Army of One&amp;#8221; &lt;/a&gt;Recruitment ads? While those ads focus on the war metaphor, they miss the value of galvanizing people together to create powerful social change. In other words, as one critic stated: &amp;#8220;If you want to be an &amp;#8216;Army of One&amp;#8217; you probably want to join the Hell&amp;#8217;s Angels, not the U.S. Army.&amp;#8221; It&amp;#8217;s not about individuality. It&amp;#8217;s about bringing people *together *around a cause or issue that matters to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of Sundance, who has in past years been accused of&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3649585/The-big-sell-out-at-Sundance.html&quot;&gt; selling out, &lt;/a&gt;they have taken a firm stance and gotten bullish about their cause. And in so doing, they have positioned their Festival against the Hollywood machine. While the war, army metaphors are resoundingly male they have gathered their army around a simple, less balls-out idea: love. All of the films in this year&amp;#8217;s Festival were chosen because at least one juror was madly, hopelessly in love with that film: Sundance director John Cooper, said&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We all looked each other in the eyes and we said, `We are only going to show a film if someone among us loves that film.&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Declaring war requires an organization to determine what it stands for. It&amp;#8217;s not enough to battle against the big, simply because they are big. It&amp;#8217;s not enough to be the Anti-something. You have to determine what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; stand for before asking others to step up and support your cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to effectively gather an army? Here are a few questions for consideration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Pick your Target: *&lt;/em&gt;Who are you against? The FDA? Big Food? The Fashion Industry? Cancer?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Build your Army: *&lt;/em&gt;Who are your constituents? What do they care about?&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Marketing the Farm</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-1784&quot; title=&quot;photo-1&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/photo-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;photo-1&quot; width=&quot;216&quot; height=&quot;288&quot; /&gt;I attended the &lt;a href=&quot;http://fieldandforknetwork.com/&quot;&gt;Field &amp;amp; Fork Network&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://farmerchefconference.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Farmer-Chef Conference&lt;/a&gt; held in Western New York yesterday. Farmers in this particular area of NY (like many others) have been driven to the brink of bankruptcy and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2010/01/post_145.html&quot;&gt;worse.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2010/01/post_145.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The Conferences&amp;#8217; main objective was to explore how farmers, who make locally produced food, can get their food into the hands of consumers and make a living for themselves and their families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early in the day, one of the keynote speakers, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2008/10/07/magazine/20081012-STYLE_6.html&quot;&gt;Patrick Martins&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heritagefoodsusa.com/&quot;&gt;Heritage Foods USA &lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slowfoodusa.org/&quot;&gt; Slow Food USA &lt;/a&gt;spoke about the importance of &lt;em&gt;taste&lt;/em&gt; in the Slow Food movement. He remarked that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slow Food and it&amp;#8217;s founder &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Petrini&quot;&gt;Carlo Petrini &lt;/a&gt; advocated eating locally insofar as local food tended to taste better. The priority for Slow Food is supporting the production of food that is &amp;#8220;the best&amp;#8221; whether it comes from the local terroir or from another locale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you can show that your milk, cheese, lamb, etc. is the best, discussions about price, etc. become secondary. Martin&amp;#8217;s emphasized that too often local food producers are satisfied with mediocrity when it comes to taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martin&amp;#8217;s comments resonated with me. I had just the night before read Seth Godin&amp;#8217;s post on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/01/the-ubiquity-of-competition.html&quot;&gt;Ubiquity of Competition&lt;/a&gt; where he concludes (in his uber-succinct Godin way)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;You don&amp;#8217;t have to like competition in order to understand that it exists. Your fair share isn&amp;#8217;t going to be yours unless you give the public a reason to pick you.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local isn&amp;#8217;t enough because there are many who can make stake to this claim. But, as Martin pointed out, &amp;#8220;if a farmer can say &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mariobatali.com/&quot;&gt;Mario Batali &lt;/a&gt;uses my apples in his apple pie, he&amp;#8217;s got something to talk about.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the day I met Pat Manning from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hudsonvalleyfresh.com/&quot;&gt;Hudson Valley Fresh, &lt;/a&gt;a non-profit dairy cooperative made up of 9 farms who produce the highest quality milk for sale in the NY area. During his inspiring presentation, Pat focused on the fact that Hudson Valley Fresh&amp;#8217;s milk is truly the freshest. And he can prove it. This milk has lower bacteria counts than other &amp;#8220;dirty&amp;#8221; milk. The milk is guaranteed 36 hours from cow to cup. The cows are treated better than cows on conventional dairy farms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why should you or I care about bacteria counts, travel time or how cows are treated? Manning has the answer; &amp;#8221; The milk just plain tastes better.&amp;#8221;  It tastes better than conventional milk, and it tastes better than other premium dairies (90 in the Hudson Valley region alone) who didn&amp;#8217;t make the cut to be one of the 9 farms that provide milk for Hudson Valley Fresh. And farmers from one of his 9 farms are regulars in local shops and store sampling their milk to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a consumer, we have many, many options to choose from. Food producers need to think about what they have that no one else can lay claim to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does your pork come from a heritage pig that has a distinct taste? Has your method of making scones been praised by Martha Stewart? Is your milk the favourite of baristas because it froths like none other?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being local is just the cost of entry. Once you&amp;#8217;re at the Farmers&amp;#8217; Market you&amp;#8217;re stall to stall with others who share that claim to fame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a tall order. Especially when you understand that farmers and food producers are already burdened with an incredible number of responsibilities. But from where I stand, the future of farming and food production lay with those who get that Ubiquity of Competition is inevitable. And only the unique will survive.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Hey CAMH I’m Quitting Quitting</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/hey-camh-im-quitting-quitting/"/>
   <updated>2010-01-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/hey-camh-im-quitting-quitting</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-1753&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-01-21 at 10.42.20 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Screen-shot-2010-01-21-at-10.42.20-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2010-01-21 at 10.42.20 AM&quot; width=&quot;157&quot; height=&quot;117&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.supportcamh.ca/&quot;&gt;The Centre of Addiction and Mental Health Foundation&amp;#8217;s &lt;/a&gt;(CAMH Foundation) new fundraising campaign kicked off in January. Piggybacking on the January New Year&amp;#8217;s resolution trend, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imaquitter.ca/&quot;&gt;iquit campaign &lt;/a&gt;promises to help you succeed in achieving your goals while raising money for CAMH. When I started seeing the posters around town I wondered about the connection between &amp;#8216;quitting&amp;#8217; bad habits and the CAMH Foundation&amp;#8217;s mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being clever is clever.  But while raising money is obviously vital to an organization like CAMH Foundation you need to tell me why I need to give a shit. Why should I sign up? How is my participation connected to the issue beyond raising funds?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I went off in search of the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I tend to think of CAMH primarily as a mental health organization, I was a bit confused. Does quitting burgers and cigarettes support better mental health? Probably, but it felt like a bit of a stretch. So, I went looking a bit deeper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out, the CAMH Foundation&amp;#8217;s mission is &amp;#8220;to raise funds for CAMH.&amp;#8221; So, theoretically, this initiative is within that scope. CAMH (not the Foundation but the organization itself) has a  mission is to &amp;#8221; help transform the lives of people affected by mental health and addiction issues.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, it was starting to become clear to me. This is about breaking addictions. Perhaps the purpose of the campaign was to shine a light on CAMH&amp;#8217;s work on addiction which is often in the shadows of it&amp;#8217;s mental health work. This was about building up addiction&amp;#8217;s profile within the organization. Or was it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, off I go the the&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imaquitter.ca/&quot;&gt; iquit homepage&lt;/a&gt;-already feeling like I&amp;#8217;ve had to do too many &lt;em&gt;mental acrobatics&lt;/em&gt; to make the connection between the campaign and the work CAMH does. When I get to the homepage all I could find was: &amp;#8220;dedicate your New Year&amp;#8217;s resolution and give it up for CAMH!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I resolve there really is no connection at all; this is just a fundraising initiative. I&amp;#8217;m not supposed to feel any closer to the cause by engaging in this campaign. I&amp;#8217;m resolved to say that this initiative doesn&amp;#8217;t pass the &amp;#8220;why should I give a shit&amp;#8221; test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people would stop here. But, being the determined super-sleuth I am, I dig yet deeper. And, buried in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imaquitter.ca/about-ftk_thankyou.aspx&quot;&gt;President and CEO&amp;#8217;s message&lt;/a&gt; is the following: &amp;#8220;By joining the i quit campaign, you are not only improving your quality of life but also helping people who struggle with their own personal addictions.&amp;#8221; And *shazam *there is the magic bullet I was looking for. This is about breaking your own personal addictions and at the same time, connecting with those who have their own demons to wrestle with. If stopping eating pastries is hard, just think about putting the kibosh on a heroine addiction. It&amp;#8217;s an opportunity to empathize and support.  It&amp;#8217;s good. It makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This message is the right one, but it is in the wrong place. I&amp;#8217;ve had to work way too hard to figure it out. And believe me, others won&amp;#8217;t be bothered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s my message, and I promise, I&amp;#8217;ll put it right up front so you don&amp;#8217;t miss it.  In any piece of communication you have one shot to tell people why they should go out of their way to join up with your cause, issue or organization. You have one opportunity to get them to buy your product, go to your website, or give to your cause. The reason I should give a shit can&amp;#8217;t be an afterthought, it needs to be front and center. Otherwise, all the cleverness in the world is just wasted creativity in search of a higher purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Saveur joins the Conversation</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-1747&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-01-19 at 11.00.26 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Screen-shot-2010-01-19-at-11.00.26-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2010-01-19 at 11.00.26 AM&quot; width=&quot;201&quot; height=&quot;249&quot; /&gt;The popular culinary magazine &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.saveur.com/index.jsp&quot;&gt;Saveur&lt;/a&gt; made the smart decision turn the reigns of this year&amp;#8217;s Saveur 100 over to the readers. Editor-in-Chief &lt;a href=&quot;http://jamesoseland.com/&quot;&gt;James Oseland&lt;/a&gt; asks &amp;#8220;Why should a cooking publication be a one way street, with information dictated by a small crew of largely Manhattan-based magazine editors? Why shouldn&amp;#8217;t it be a dialogue?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#8217;s just what they did. Saveur readers submitted fantastic finds like the Sacred Heard Church ravioli dinner in Cincinnati, Ohio and divine looking &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inesrosales.com/&quot;&gt;Ines Rosales Olive Oil Tortas &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only was life suddenly easier for Saveur magazine who had gobs of content supplied by readers, but the content was far more interesting. Just knowing that someone in their living room felt passionate enough to write Saveur and tell them about their culinary find made it worth reading. And, the conversation continues online. A readers&amp;#8217; recipe for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Chocolate-Gravy&quot;&gt;chocolate gravy &lt;/a&gt; has erupted into a friendly debate about the origins of a traditional treat of chocolate smeared on toast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice work Saveur recognizing the massive movement of foodies online and helping bring their contributions to loyal Saveur readers.&lt;/p&gt;

            Your mama was right. It matters who you choose to associate with. Stand in a crowd of smokers huddled outside an office building and most will assume you&amp;#8217;re a smoker too. Even if all you&amp;#8217;re doing is getting a breath of fresh (not so fresh?) air. Companies should follow this simple lesson which we all know from our own lives; as much as you can try and compartmentalize and intellectualize decisions, others don&amp;#8217;t see it that way. People get an overall &amp;#8220;gut&amp;#8221; impression of who you are and what you stand for by the decisions you make.

          My most recent issue of &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.good.is/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;GOOD magazine&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; arrived yesterday. GOOD is a great publication featuring &amp;amp;#8220;a collaboration of individuals, businesses, and nonprofits pushing the world forward.&amp;amp;#8221; By it&amp;amp;#8217;s own admission, GOOD is &amp;amp;#8220;for people who give a damn.&amp;amp;#8221; But, the people they choose to hang out with do damage to the brand.
        &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

        &amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Verdana; min-height: 16.0px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Verdana;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
            Every month when my GOOD magazine arrives, I find myself disappointed by the Ralph Lauren Rugby ad on the back page of the magazine. I found this ad placement particularly disturbing during the recent &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/10/09/emboing-boingem-and-ralph_n_311593.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color: #002bee; text-decoration: underline;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Ralph Lauren kerfuffle&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; when RL and his friends resisted taking responsibility for photoshopping a model who ended up looking so emaciated a &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.boingboing.net/2009/09/29/ralph-lauren-opens-n.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color: #002bee; text-decoration: underline;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Boing Boing blogger &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;commented &amp;amp;#8220;Dude, her head is bigger than her pelvis.&amp;amp;#8221;
          &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

          &amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Verdana; min-height: 16.0px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;

              It is tough being Good. Just ask a vegetarian. Take one step toward righeousness by reducing meat consumption and everyone wants to call you out on wearing leather shoes. Magazines wlike Cosmopolitan and Lucky don&amp;amp;#8217;t have GOOD&amp;amp;#8217;s issues. And, GOOD has had it&amp;amp;#8217;s share of financial difficulties and now only publishes four issues a year. However, that is the burden of trying to be GOOD. And, GOOD needs to suck that up.
            &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

            &amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Verdana; min-height: 16.0px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;

                I was particularly interested yesterday when the latest of GOOD included two letters to the editor criticizing GOOD for including advertisers such as the &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;www.gap.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Gap&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Methodist_Church&amp;quot;&amp;gt;United Methodist Church&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; whose values were deemed inconsistent with those of the magazine. The editor&amp;amp;#8217;s response was as follows:
              &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

              &amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Verdana;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;

                  &amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Verdana; margin: 0px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
                    &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#8220;GOOD is an advertising-supported business, because we believe that doing good can and must be financially as well as morally successful.That doesn&amp;amp;#8217;t mean we endorse all the practices of our advertisers&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;
                  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

                  &amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Verdana; margin: 0px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
                    &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;(or, for that matter, that they endorse everything that appears in our pages.But if you&amp;amp;#8217;re upset with the policies of a business that suppotts us, make it clear to us,and more importantly, to that company itself.&amp;amp;#8221;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;
                  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

                      With or without such a disclaimer, GOOD&amp;amp;#8217;s readers are impacted by the advertisers that appear in their pages.

The paper&amp;amp;#8217;s tagline says it all: &amp;amp;#8220;Proudly urban, totally independent, fiercely smart &amp;amp; a little bit silly.&amp;amp;#8221; The Little Paper is an absolutely essential publication for parents because it lists virtually every activity happening in Toronto. And, it has very healthy circulation of &amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;font: 13.0px Arial;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;10,000 families a month&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;. Several of the &amp;amp;#8220;usual suspect&amp;amp;#8221; parent magazine advertisers like &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.nestle.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Nestle&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.jnj.com/connect/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Johnson + Johnson&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.babyeinstein.com/home/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Baby Einstein&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; would purchase advertising if approached by The Little Paper. But that&amp;amp;#8217;s not how The Little Paper rolls.
                      &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

                      &amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Verdana;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
                        &amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Verdana;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
                          Instead you&amp;amp;#8217;ll find small ads from a bunch of local kids&amp;amp;#8217; programs, clothing stores and the like. The result? A magazine that lives up to it&amp;amp;#8217;s claim to be &amp;amp;#8220;fiercely independent.&amp;amp;#8221; Vicki calls it &amp;amp;#8220;Enlightened self interest.&amp;amp;#8221; In her words &amp;amp;#8220;as long as independents support the Little Paper, the Little Paper puts them first.&amp;amp;#8221;
                        &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

                        &amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Verdana; min-height: 16.0px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
                          &amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Verdana;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
                            Similarly, if you, like GOOD, claim to represent people who &amp;amp;#8220;give a damn&amp;amp;#8221; than they should keep better company than Ralph Lauren. He&amp;amp;#8217;s just not your type. It may require a different business model, but you&amp;amp;#8217;re only as good as the company you keep.
                          &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

   <title>Bogs, Crocs + Jalapeño Peppers (Oh My!)</title>

   <id>http://getpoole.com/bogs-crocs-jalapeno-peppers-oh-my</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I bought myse&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-1723&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-01-12 at 10.47.58 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Screen-shot-2010-01-12-at-10.47.58-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2010-01-12 at 10.47.58 AM&quot; width=&quot;109&quot; height=&quot;115&quot; /&gt;lf and my kids these groovy new winter boots called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bogsfootwear.com/&quot;&gt;Bogs&lt;/a&gt;. There&amp;#8217;s a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bogsfootwear.com/Technology&quot;&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt; involved in creating a boot that looks and functions like a rainboot but keeps your feet warm and dry in the coldest, wettest weather. The Bogs phenomenon has been spreading like crazy. I predict they&amp;#8217;ll be the next &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crocs.com/home/homepage,default,pg.html&quot;&gt;Crocs. &lt;/a&gt; The comparison to Crocs is not incidental. What makes both these shoes so unique is that they don&amp;#8217;t look like other shoes. Both Crocs&amp;#8217; and Bogs&amp;#8217; uniqueness is accentuated by their use of bold colours and graphics. The take-away message is &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m a little different. And I want you to notice.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent post&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/&quot;&gt; Seth Godin&lt;/a&gt; talks about what it must have been like to talk about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/12/whats-it-like-the-sad-story-of-the-hot-pepper.html&quot;&gt;jalapeño pepper&lt;/a&gt; when it first arrived in the new world. The question &amp;#8220;What&amp;#8217;s it like?&amp;#8221; would have been incredibly difficult to answer. A jalapeno is not like a capsicum and not like black pepper. Similarly, Crocs are not sandals or gardening shoes and Bogs are not rainboots or traditional winter boots. And if they were, they wouldn&amp;#8217;t be nearly as interesting, chatworthy or popular as they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Seth says: &amp;#8220;What&amp;#8217;s it like? leads to sequels and high concepts and crossovers, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t get us 1966 Bob Dylan or even yoga class.&amp;#8221; Also, importantly, &amp;#8220;What&amp;#8217;s it like?&amp;#8221; leads to amazing conversations that make ideas spread like wildfire. I can say that my Bogs have given me entree into more conversations than any object of clothing I have &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; worn. And, I&amp;#8217;m happy to tell people &amp;#8220;yes, they are warm&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;yes, they keep my feet dry&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;yes, they are soooooo comfortable (&amp;#8220;like slippers&amp;#8221; I tell them.)&amp;#8221; At this point, I&amp;#8217;ve sold so many Bogs they should be sending me a kickback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When something isn&amp;#8217;t like anything else, the best response (as Seth says) is &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s not like anything. You need to trust me and just taste it.&amp;#8221; Or, in my case, wear it. Conversations are the most powerful form of advertising. Who you gonna listen to? A mom with 2 kids hanging out at the gymnasium or an ad in a parenting magazine?  One is a dynamic, two way discussion where you can answer the &amp;#8220;What&amp;#8217;s it like&amp;#8221; question. The other is a static, push approach that doesn&amp;#8217;t allow for meaningful engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Poppy Effect</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/the-poppy-effect/"/>
   <updated>2010-01-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/the-poppy-effect</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s call it the &amp;#8220;Poppy Effect.&amp;#8221; You spend a couple of bucks on a Poppy around Remembrance Day to recall &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=canrem&quot;&gt;Canadian Veterans &lt;/a&gt;and to support the efforts of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://legion.ca/Home/mission_e.cfm&quot;&gt;Royal Canadian Legion.&lt;/a&gt; The Poppy Effect sets the barrier to entry very low, so that you are inclined to sign on for a cause. By opting to wear the Poppy you&amp;#8217;ve aligned yourself with the issue at hand. It&amp;#8217;s now the organization&amp;#8217;s role to cultivate that relationship so you become a supporter, and ultimately an evangelist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many organizations have leveraged the Poppy Effect to great success; Pink, white, yellow, red ribbons abound all for good causes organizers hope will, in turn, lead you to give greater support to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbcf.org/&quot;&gt;breast cancer,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;www.whiteribbon.ca&quot;&gt;violence against women&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redfridays.ca/yellowribbon.htm&quot;&gt;Canadian troops&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.canfar.com/index.php?option=com_frontpage&amp;amp;Itemid=1&amp;amp;lang=en&quot;&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt;. Certainly &lt;a href=&quot;http://cwt.sa.utoronto.ca/&quot;&gt;CharityWate&lt;/a&gt;r is the model for how to attract people to a party, and then turn those revellers into an army of supporters. A Toronto &lt;a href=&quot;http://toronto.twestival.com/&quot;&gt;Twestival&lt;/a&gt; in support of the organization raised over $6,000. Not a whole heck of alot of money, but a good start in relationship building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think Bill Murray in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103241/&quot;&gt;What About Bob&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s all about the baby steps my friend. What&amp;#8217;s the easiest, most appealing way to get folks headed down the path to deeply identify with your issue, cause or organization?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft&quot; style=&quot;margin-right: 12px;&quot; title=&quot;Refugee Week Banner&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/3341852080_d09698470b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Refugee Week Banner&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;266&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s what&amp;#8217;s so great about UK &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.refugeeweek.org.uk/simple-acts/&quot;&gt;Refugee Week&amp;#8217;s Simple Acts Campaign.&lt;/a&gt; The Campaign offers up 20 micro-sized activities to help people see refugees in a new and different way. Simple Acts are as easy to do as  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.refugeeweek.org.uk/simple-acts/twenty-acts/cook_a_dish/&quot;&gt;Cook a Dish from Another Country &lt;/a&gt; with recipes provided on the site. Once you register to complete a Simple Act, you indicate that you&amp;#8217;ve completed it on the tracker. To date, over 7000 Simple Acts have been completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other key benefit of the &amp;#8220;Poppy Effect&amp;#8221; is that by seeing others wear the poppy, you get to feel like you&amp;#8217;re part of a community that is creating social momentum around an issue. There&amp;#8217;s nothing worse than feeling like you&amp;#8217;re alone pushing a rock up a hill. And causes like eradicating cancer or ending child poverty are so huge that the only way to even consider tackling them is one small step at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple Acts has leveraged the power of community by featuring several Simple Acts that encourage participants to post, share and promote their participation. For example, one Simple Act is to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.refugeeweek.org.uk/simple-acts/twenty-acts/banner&quot;&gt;take a picture of yourself holding up a pro-refugee banner&lt;/a&gt; and upload it to their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/groups/simpleacts/&quot;&gt;Flickr page.&lt;/a&gt; There are some great photos of folks from all walks of life sending a public message about refugees (granted, the 17 pictures posted suggests they didn&amp;#8217;t do enough to promote social media engagement).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When considering baby steps ask yourself the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Who is my audience? Obviously, you wouldn&amp;#8217;t want to throw &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.charitywater.org/&quot;&gt;CharityWater &lt;/a&gt;style Twestival if your constituents are an older demographic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  What do they like to do? Are they people who are likely to engage from work?  Are they singles looking for opportunities to meet others? Are they parents who are pressed for time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Meet them where they are.  Instead of asking them to attend YOUR charity auction, ask them to give proceeds of THEIR rummage sale to your cause. That&amp;#8217;s what &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.remax-western.ca/yard-sale-cure&quot;&gt;Yard Sale for the Cure&lt;/a&gt; is all about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Break it down. The lower the barrier to entry the more likely participation will be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Make it appealing. If it&amp;#8217;s not a good looking pin, a fun party, an activity they&amp;#8217;ll actually enjoy participating in, they&amp;#8217;re not likely to do it. Someone recently bought me this &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.peta.org/archives/2009/09/win_tofu_never_screams.php&quot;&gt;Tofu Doesn&amp;#8217;t Scream&lt;/a&gt; T-Shirt in support of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.peta.org/&quot;&gt;PeTA&lt;/a&gt;. The T-shirt was so great I had to have it. The alliance with PeTA came second.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Follow through. If you don&amp;#8217;t leverage the opportunity once they&amp;#8217;ve walked through the door, you&amp;#8217;ve not only wasted your time, but you may actually create a negative perception of your organization. After their party CharityWater sent participants &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.charitywater.org/twestival/&quot;&gt;videos of wells their dollars dug&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Apple’s crushing market share &#038; insidious strategy</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/apples-crushing-market-share-and-insidious-strategy/"/>
   <updated>2010-01-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/apples-crushing-market-share-and-insidious-strategy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;mceTemp&quot;&gt;
  &lt;dl id=&quot;attachment_1671&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 392px;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;dt class=&quot;wp-caption-dt&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-1671&quot; title=&quot;happymac&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/happymacandfriends_20070608175116.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image of happy macintosh&quot; width=&quot;382&quot; height=&quot;196&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PC users who&amp;#8217;ve had to put up with mac owners going on about their purchase have always had a single rebuttal: &amp;#8220;If Macs are so great, why don&amp;#8217;t they have a bigger market share?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My answer has always been to point at strategic business decisions that made it easier for PCs to spread in the early days. An operating system that works on any box travels well. We&amp;#8217;re a resilient species and learned to live with the thorns that come from our love/hate relationship with Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But after 18 years of owning Macs and 12 years running businesses on them, it just occurred to me that Apple has had a virtual stranglehold on it&amp;#8217;s market since day one. It&amp;#8217;s just a matter of how you define the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder why it never occurred to me before: What other brand is measured by it&amp;#8217;s status in the entire world? Not even automobile brands are measured by true international share. That&amp;#8217;s silly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We encourage our clients to define their audiences as &amp;#8220;communities of interest&amp;#8221;: Enthusiasts interested because something a brand does resonates with their values. Most of us consumers don&amp;#8217;t define ourselves by the brands we buy anymore (that&amp;#8217;s so 80&amp;#8242;s). So why would this Mac/PC market share discussion be about anyone who could possibly use a computer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple never targeted &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;. The folks they spoke to through smart, well designed tools were a smaller niche of people who would appreciate their efforts. And evangelize for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PCs are for &amp;#8220;users&amp;#8221;. Macs are for fans. Great strategy because it&amp;#8217;s a win/win. Instead of looking at the market as prospective buyers, Apple&amp;#8217;s partnership approach puts the &amp;#8220;co&amp;#8221; in &amp;#8216;consumer&amp;#8217;. As a long time fan, I&amp;#8217;m grateful they&amp;#8217;ve been able to keep up their end of the bargain.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/dd&gt;
      &lt;/dl&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    This holiday was pretty mellow. Having spent too much time &amp; money partying all through December, I was ready to lay low. That, and the fact that Christmas seemed to suddenly appear out of nowhere.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    My own family doesn&amp;#8217;t really do much since my mom passed away a few years ago, other than one eating/cocktail/wee-cousins-getting-gifts gathering, usually held at my sister&amp;#8217;s place. That&amp;#8217;s a nice get in/get out event: dress up, wrap gifts, drink, say hi to siblings I see once a year, eat bon bons, go home.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    My husband&amp;#8217;s family is another story. Christmas trees, baking, ornaments, siblings traveling from out of town, getting up at 7am to crowd around the tree, huge breakfast, more baking, huge dinner. Then there&amp;#8217;s the whole gift thing. When I first married into this family, I was awed by the amount of gifts that were exchanged. My mother-in-law is an amazing woman who loves to fill her already-packed day with buying the right gifts for each of her four children and their respective partners. I&amp;#8217;ve always been amazed at how she found the time to do this. I can barely make it out to buy toothpaste.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    I used to be a bit of a packrat, so accumulating lots of great stuff over the holidays was fabulous. Over the years, however, I realized I was accumulating way too &lt;em style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; of that stuff {insert George Carlin joke here}, and I got tired of dusting and finding places to display said stuff. Add the birth of a kid who does nothing &lt;em style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; accumulate stuff, and it wasn&amp;#8217;t long before we showed up on an episode of &lt;em style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Hoarders&lt;/em&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    All that coupled with the idea that I was feeling pretty lucky with what I had in terms of family, and that not many are as fortunate, I started asking for &lt;em style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; stuff. Or asking for a donation, like a goat, or microloan, or something similar. This thread of thinking caught on with others in the family, and over the past few years, the giant pile of glossy gifts under the tree has dwindled. Less stuff to pack in the car, less stuff to find a place for, happier recipients in a far off land. Huzzah.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    A nice bonus to this Less Stuff deal was the introduction of a Kris Kringle-type exchange among the siblings and their partners. Pick a name out of a hat and that&amp;#8217;s the only gift you have to give. The kicker? It has to be handmade.
  &lt;/p&gt;

    This was a very welcome treat. It&amp;#8217;s a chance to step away from the evil that is shopping, avoiding the whole wait-til-last-possible-minute-to-throw-money-at-a-gift-they&amp;#8217;ll-never-use nonsense. And seeing as most of us are in creative industries but spend too much time on our computers, it&amp;#8217;s also a chance to get back to basics, to get our hands dirty again.

        My son&amp;#8217;s favourite game &amp;#8220;Would You Rather&amp;#8221; translated into a hand-illustrated book.

That last one didn&amp;#8217;t go over too well.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
    2009 was the second annual such exchange, and it turned out beautifully. Seems everyone had fun making their gifts, and all recipients seemed quite happy.
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
    So instead of loathing everything about Christmas, due mostly to rampant commercialism and Stuff Accumulation, I&amp;#8217;m now happy to be part of this annual family &amp;#8216;art collective&amp;#8217;. Fun to both make and receive, it&amp;#8217;s a great way to slow down and truly think about what you&amp;#8217;re giving. Time and thought are valuable commodities that cannot be replaced.
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Beautiful Music for a Crazy World</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/beautiful-music-for-a-crazy-world/"/>
   <updated>2010-01-07T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/beautiful-music-for-a-crazy-world</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: left; border: 0px initial initial;&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-01-07 at 3.49.24 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Screen-shot-2010-01-07-at-3.49.24-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2010-01-07 at 3.49.24 PM&quot; width=&quot;374&quot; height=&quot;446&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.classical963fm.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.classical963fm.com/&quot;&gt;Classical radio&amp;#8217;s 96.3 fm&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s tagline &amp;#8216;Beautiful Music for a Crazy World&amp;#8221; is fabulous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen, only a small number of us will actually go to the Symphony or have a solid Classical music pedigree (I blame my parents for my lack of knowledge in this area); We need a good reason to listen to Classical music. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hillstrategies.com/docs/Orchestras_Canada_final.pdf&quot;&gt;recent survey&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hillstrategies.com/&quot;&gt;Hill Strategies&lt;/a&gt; showed that less than 10 per cent of the Canadian population will attend a live Classical music performance in a given year. The last time I went to the Toronto Symphony Orchestra was when I worked there and I mostly watched old guys snooze. But, I have 96.3 tuned-in on my radio dial. For the most part, I don&amp;#8217;t know my Wagner from my Mozart. But this tagline tells me I don&amp;#8217;t have to. I can listen just to enjoy the beautiful music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;96.3 does not dumb-down Classical music like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tso.ca/season/ticket/series_detail.cfm?ID=260&amp;amp;SType=36&quot;&gt;TSO&amp;#8217;s Pops performances&lt;/a&gt; featuring Broadway Classics from &lt;em&gt;My Fair Lady *and&lt;/em&gt; The Sound of Music.*They honour their core constituent&amp;#8217;s passion for the art form. But their communications approach to Classical music answers the question &amp;#8220;What&amp;#8217;s in it for me?&amp;#8221;. Is it because we&amp;#8217;re a generation of self-centered assholes that answering this question is so vital? Maybe. But the reality is that the generation of die-hard Classical music performance attendees is aging. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hillstrategies.com/docs/Orchestras_Canada_final.pdf&quot;&gt;same survey&lt;/a&gt; I referred to earlier also shows that 65-74 year olds are twice as likely to go to such a performance as 25-34 year olds. The tagline &amp;#8220;Beautiful Music for a Crazy World&amp;#8221; does not have a trace of cod-liver-oil (you should, you must, you need to) that is bound to send the more youthful set reaching for the radio dial. So, the tagline is 96.3 fm&amp;#8217;s succession plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out this &lt;a href=&quot;http://sharonda.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a57cc926970b0120a5e0e164970b-800wi&quot;&gt;little cartoon&lt;/a&gt; which demonstrates the extent to which Classical music has been disconnected from marketing. It asks a very poignant question: If you want Classical music to be marketable, why would you title your latest work &amp;#8220;Symphony 57 with Variations in D Minor?&amp;#8221; The cultural sector has been particularly guilty of navel-gazing. For too long they have believed that if they build it we will come. What 96.3 fm gets is that need to tell us why we need to come to Classical music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the execution of this strategy falls short. And the problem rests in the under-leveraging of the brilliant tag line. In their effort to bring the tagline to life, 96.3 fm has animated the ‘beautiful music’ part of their agenda, but let the ‘crazy world’ part wither and atrophy. &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/classical963fm&quot;&gt;96.3&amp;#8242;s Twitter account &lt;/a&gt;features fun and engaging information about the Classical music world in a light-hearted tone. They have great events like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.classical963fm.com/blog/madama-butterfly&quot;&gt;Lobby Concerts &lt;/a&gt;and some useful site features like an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.classical963fm.com/arts/calendar&quot;&gt;Arts + Events calendar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.classical963fm.com/arts/calendar&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;and a fun contest like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.classical963fm.com/antinoisepollution/&quot;&gt;Anti-Noise Pollution League &lt;/a&gt;to encourage restaurants to play Classical music. Moses invites people to participate and sign his petition by asking “I’ve had it with the &lt;em&gt;boom boom&lt;/em&gt;, haven’t you?” All good. But really, it&amp;#8217;s all about the music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I have to ask, where is the crazy? Bring on the crazy! 96.3 fm could really distinguish itself from it&amp;#8217;s serious competitors like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbc.ca/radio2/&quot;&gt;CBC Radio 2&lt;/a&gt; by talking about what is crazy about this world that makes us want to retreat into the universe of Classical music the moment we close the door to our car, home, office, etc. Have you seen this funny &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h-uhoCmyH8&quot;&gt;little nugget&lt;/a&gt; featuring Mandy Patinkin shining a light on why rude people (“is everyone in this line an asshole?”) make us all crazy? How about using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.classical963fm.com/blog&quot;&gt;their blog&lt;/a&gt; for fun rants about the repetition of news stories on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;, the insanity of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15213212&quot;&gt;proroguing government&lt;/a&gt;, or the insane scenes that emerge when you try to get your kids to sit down to a nutritious meal? There&amp;#8217;s certainly plenty of crazy to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about inviting 96.3 fm &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/group.php?v=info&amp;amp;ref=search&amp;amp;gid=5848473279&quot;&gt;Facebook fans&lt;/a&gt; to participate in a contest highlighting the crazy-world realities that drive us to seek out Classical music in our lives? In fact, if you look at their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/group.php?v=wall&amp;amp;ref=search&amp;amp;gid=5848473279&quot;&gt;Facebook wall&lt;/a&gt;, this is what folks are already talking about. One writer says how Classical music forces her to do her homework, another talks about how it saves his sanity while travelling long distances in his car. It&amp;#8217;s all right there in black and white. All they&amp;#8217;d need to do is get people to better mine their stories, collect media and &lt;em&gt;shazam!&lt;/em&gt; ready-made content to bring their tagline to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is that 96.3 fm&amp;#8217;s unique spin is right there embedded in their own tagline. Take a look at your company&amp;#8217;s tagline, it&amp;#8217;s mantra or whatever you call it. Have you really brought it to life in it&amp;#8217;s fullest form? What possibilities are there to engage people in a meaningful way?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Come on Wendy’s: Get Real</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/come-on-wendys-get-real/"/>
   <updated>2010-01-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/come-on-wendys-get-real</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-1620&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2010-01-05 at 11.26.55 AM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Screen-shot-2010-01-05-at-11.26.55-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2010-01-05 at 11.26.55 AM&quot; width=&quot;637&quot; height=&quot;355&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptHgHgzIItU&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Wendy&amp;#8217;s has recently launched the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wendysrealtime.com/#/real-videos&quot;&gt;You Know When it&amp;#8217;s Real &lt;/a&gt;campaign. The campaign uses &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; in two senses of the word; Real because it exploits real time features like a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wendysrealtime.com/#/real-time&quot;&gt;Twitter feed &lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wendysrealtime.com/#/real-videos&quot;&gt;video contest&lt;/a&gt; and real in terms of freshness and quality product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of the first use of the term real, the campaign&amp;#8217;s social media features are random. None of the content is useful, shareworthy or connected to the broader campaign idea. I would put this in the camp of social media for social media&amp;#8217;s sake and not in support of a broader idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In it&amp;#8217;s other use of the term &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; Wendy&amp;#8217;s is striving to stand apart from the fast-food pack by focusing on the fact that the burgers are not frozen and that they are handmade. The campaign features a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptHgHgzIItU&quot;&gt;series of ads&lt;/a&gt; highlighting their idea of real-ness with fun visuals and music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s take pause and consider Wendy&amp;#8217;s use of the term real. We are in a particular moment in the food-zeitgeist. Michael Pollan&amp;#8217;s best-selling &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.michaelpollan.com/omnivore.php&quot;&gt;Ominvore&amp;#8217;s Dilemma &lt;/a&gt;was recently named one of New York Times&amp;#8217; and Washington Post&amp;#8217;s 10 best books of the year. The book&amp;#8217;s thesis boils down to Pollan&amp;#8217;s opening quote &amp;#8220;Eat Real Food. Not too much. Mostly plants.&amp;#8221;  This is not a marginal book. And, this is not a marginal movement. And this quote is very, very sticky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond Pollan, consider the following; The film &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foodincmovie.com/&quot;&gt;Food Inc. &lt;/a&gt; (now available at a video store near you) has brought the issue of factory farming to the mainstream. The super campy and accessible tone of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.skinnybitch.net/about.html&quot;&gt;Skinny Bitch&lt;/a&gt; involves calling meat eating &amp;#8220;The Dead, Rotting, Decomposing Flesh Diet.&amp;#8221; Marginal? Well, Skinny Bitch continues to be a huge hit and has been #1 on the The New York Times&amp;#8217; bestselling list. More recently, Alicia Silverstone&amp;#8217;s new vegan cookbook is called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Kind-Diet-Simple-Feeling-Losing/dp/1605296449&quot;&gt;The Kind Diet&lt;/a&gt; and talks at length about the impact of factory farming on the planet. New York Times columnist and mega-cookbook author Mark Bittman&amp;#8217;s latest book is called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.markbittman.com/books/food-matters&quot;&gt;Food Matters&lt;/a&gt; and like the others I&amp;#8217;ve mentioned, shines a light on factory meat and it&amp;#8217;s impact on the health of humans and the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phew. So back to Wendy&amp;#8217;s. In light of this conversation, what marketing genius thought calling Wendy&amp;#8217;s meat real on the basis that it&amp;#8217;s not frozen would satisfy consumers&amp;#8217; hunger for real food? Have a look at the website. Some of their big claims under the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wendysrealtime.com/#/fresh-facts&quot;&gt;Fresh Facts&lt;/a&gt; tab are that their tomatoes are hand sliced daily, their lettuce (iceberg!) is hand-leafed (what?) and the delivery truck makes lots of deliveries. Wow. I&amp;#8217;m feeling a little un-impressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling yourself real sets the bar pretty high. In fact the ads rely on images of Abe Lincoln, the Statue of Liberty and flashes a mock Declaration of Freshness. One blog takes an obvious stab at Wendy&amp;#8217;s idea  real by showing what a &lt;a href=&quot;http://abesauer.com/2009/10/22/wendys-ad-fail-you-know-when-its-real-and-it-never-is/&quot;&gt;real Wendy&amp;#8217;s burger looks like &lt;/a&gt;compared to the glossy image on the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several years ago &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chipotle.com/#/land&quot;&gt;Chipotle&lt;/a&gt; took on a similar positioning with the tagline &amp;#8220;Food With Integrity.&amp;#8221; But, as it is described on the website, it is not just a positioning, it is  &amp;#8220;a philosophy that we can always do better in terms of the food we buy.&amp;#8221; Real food is Chipotle&amp;#8217;s reality, not just their positioning. They back it up with credible business practices summed up in a compelling, galvanizing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chipotle.com/#/flash/fwi_story&quot;&gt;Manifesto.&lt;/a&gt; And, they actually support the principles of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chipotle.com/#/flash/fwi_food-inc&quot;&gt;Food Inc.&lt;/a&gt; and encourage people to watch the film. Why? Because as the CEO says &amp;#8220;The more people know where their food comes from, the more they&amp;#8217;ll appreciate what we do.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re going to conjure up Abe Lincoln and the Statue of Liberty and singing a jingle with the lyrics &amp;#8220;Our philosophy, is good old honesty,&amp;#8221; you&amp;#8217;d better be able to back it up. And in this case, Wendy&amp;#8217;s can&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My pal Craig Swistun just sent over this exchange regarding spec work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the beginning of a hysterical but also sad exchange. I&amp;#8217;ve come across my share of enthusiastic folks with bad ideas and no clue why you don&amp;#8217;t want to work on them instead of your paying client work informed by good ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Simon,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.27bslash6.com/images/clear.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;20&quot; height=&quot;5&quot; /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Disregarding the fact that you have still not paid me for work I completed earlier this year despite several assertions that you would do so, I would be delighted to spend my free time creating logos and pie charts for you based on further vague promises of future possible payment. Please find attached pie chart as requested and let me know of any changes required.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.27bslash6.com/images/clear.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;20&quot; height=&quot;5&quot; /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Regards, David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do read the entire back and forth. It&amp;#8217;s worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.27bslash6.com/p2p.html&quot; title=&quot;Link to article&quot;&gt;Please design a logo for me. With pie charts. For free.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It particularly resonated with me because the site reminded me of a book called &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Letters-Nut-Ted-L-Nancy/dp/0380973545&quot; title=&quot;Book: Letters from a nut&quot;&gt;Letters from a nut&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; I read while in the hospital recovering from an appendectomy. This was a problem, because the book defined &amp;#8216;side-splitting&amp;#8217; humour for me. I believe it was written by Jerry Seinfeld under a pseudonym.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was slightly different than the letters here because the foil in those letters is inane corporate policy and the drones who peddle it. Here, we&amp;#8217;re largely talking about business owners with a simple lack of consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to eliminate H1N1? Invest in the most expensive, luxurious hand soap you can get your hands on. But two; one for your home bathroom and one for the office. I get my kids to hand wash by getting them excited about the soap; &amp;#8220;look, it&amp;#8217;s the foamy kind&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;ooh pink soap.&amp;#8221; Dreamy soap is much more enticing than Life brand antibacterial cleanser and much more likely to spur on action than scary images of flu victims. The same principles apply for all social change initiatives&amp;#8211;it&amp;#8217;s better to engage people than to scare the crap out of them. Fear leads to paralysis. Engagement, to action.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Is You Is or Is You Ain’t?</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/is-you-is-or-is-you-aint/"/>

   <id>http://getpoole.com/is-you-is-or-is-you-aint</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1583&quot; title=&quot;Picture 5&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Picture-5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Picture 5&quot; width=&quot;331&quot; height=&quot;392&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently made a big leap and made a nice sized (for me) donation to a non-profit organization. It was the right fit&amp;#8211;it spoke to my values, and resonated with me personally.  It is the new fundraising arm of an existing foundation. To recognize the first group of funders who banded together for the cause, we were feted at an event and given a view of the Founders&amp;#8217; wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the perks of being a founding member is being included on an artist rendered wall. Who wouldn&amp;#8217;t want their name in lights? I was invited to a lovely dinner, met lots of very nice people and had a ton of warm and fuzzy feeling for being part of something good. At the end of the evening, the Founders&amp;#8217; wall was revealed and was received with a very positive outpouring from the donors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on, after the crowd dispersed, I wandered back to the wall to get a closer look at the plaque commemorating our donation. The names of the 300 Founding members were rendered onto the plaque with *stickers. *Fancy stickers, but stickers nonetheless. I wandered down the hall at other plaques recognizing other donations. All of those were *etched *in stone. Don&amp;#8217;t get me wrong. The organization deeply appreciated the contributions of the donors, and we in turn felt that appreciation. But this detail created a sense of duality that called the rest of the experience into question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s always like that. It&amp;#8217;s the little stuff that makes the biggest impact and creates a sense of loyalty. If, for example, you were an airline and you believed I would be yours forever and never do you wrong, you wouldn&amp;#8217;t mind giving me a free cup of coffee (even a latte?) a tiny biscuit, or let me make a call using your phone (&amp;#8217;cause I don&amp;#8217;t have a cell)? You&amp;#8217;d give me free internet in your lounge. I mean why not? I&amp;#8217;m coming back, right? This is the story of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flyporter.com/&quot;&gt;Porter Airline&lt;/a&gt;. If you&amp;#8217;ve flown Porter you knew it, if you haven&amp;#8217;t flown Porter, you must try it. They make it feel like a relationship, not a quickie in the back of the car. They&amp;#8217;re courting me. I&amp;#8217;m all over it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aircanada.com/&quot;&gt;Air Canada &lt;/a&gt;on the other hand (world&amp;#8217;s easiest target, I know) &lt;a href=&quot;http://gigaom.com/2009/11/20/air-canada-will-offer-in-flight-wi-fi-too/&quot;&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that they&amp;#8217;d be providing wifi during flights. Wow. Great. But of course it comes at a price. $9.95 on a laptop or $7.95 on a smaller device to be exact. Last week, they &lt;a href=&quot;htthttp://news.globaltv.com/entertainment/Canada+adding+extra+legroom/2215926/story.html&quot;&gt;announced &lt;/a&gt;that they&amp;#8217;ll charge you up to $22 each way to sit in the bulkhead. I get that Air Canada&amp;#8217;s having some major&lt;a href=&quot;http://http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/November2009/06/c6608.html&quot;&gt; financial troubles. &lt;/a&gt;But they seem to be getting further away from the solution to their problems. You can treat me like a one night stand. We can mutually consent to shack up. But then don&amp;#8217;t turn around and expect me to marry you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue exists on a much smaller scale. Recently, I had to buy flowers for an event. My usual stop, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jaidenspetals.com/&quot;&gt;Jaiden&amp;#8217;s Petals &lt;/a&gt;was closed. So, I ventured further afield into a flower shop I generally avoid. It seems nice enough. But scratch the surface (just like those damn stickers at the Founding funders event) and the illusion disappears. Buying flowers, a generally feel-good experience, felt like nothing more than a money grab. And that experience was defined by the smallest of details; the quality of some of the blooms, the lack of caring service, the feeling of being rushed. So I took as few blooms as I could and left, never to return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the keys to a healthy, long lasting relationship:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Never take the other person for granted; I may be here today, but if you don&amp;#8217;t treat me like my mama said, I could be gone tomorrow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Make me feel pretty; Pamper me a little, indulge me. And act like you mean it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Take it slow; Delay instant gratification for a longer term win. Court me. I&amp;#8217;m worth it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Call me after; Keep in touch. And not just when you want something&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t lead me on; Don&amp;#8217;t tell me we&amp;#8217;re forever if you don&amp;#8217;t really mean it. I might get mad. And you don&amp;#8217;t want to see me when I&amp;#8217;m mad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Is it all Adding Up?</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/is-it-all-adding-up/"/>
   <updated>2009-11-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/is-it-all-adding-up</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1572&quot; title=&quot;Picture 1&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Picture-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Picture 1&quot; width=&quot;481&quot; height=&quot;364&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their brilliant book &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.madetostick.com/&quot;&gt;Made to Stick&lt;/a&gt;, authors Chip and Dan Heath talk about the importance of concreteness in standing out. Creating a mental picture of your ideas, in other words &amp;#8220;show us don&amp;#8217;t tell us.&amp;#8221; I&amp;#8217;ve seen two small examples of this for values-based brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.notfarfromthetree.org/&quot;&gt;Not Far From the Tree&lt;/a&gt;, a local organization that picks fruit from homes and public spaces and divides the pickin&amp;#8217;s between the home&amp;#8217;s owner, NFFTT volunteers, and local community organizations. For them, it&amp;#8217;s all about pounds of fruit. On Twitter, and other their website, they always feature how many pounds of fruit they&amp;#8217;ve collected and compare it to last year&amp;#8217;s amount. This year, their volunteers picked 8,315 pounds. Sound like alot. I think. The next challenge would be to demonstrate what 8135 pounds looks like&amp;#8211;is it 26 sumo wrestlers? is it a small elephant? Is it all the apples that Loblaws sells in a year? Telling me this would make the abstract number of pounds  more concrete. Making it concrete would make me more impressed, more moved, more likely to donate, volunteer, spread the word, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another organization who is striving to make their impact more concrete is a car sharing service &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pickuppal.com/pup/intro.html&quot;&gt;PickupPal.&lt;/a&gt; Pick up pal connects people so they can carpool eachother to various destinations.  On their homepage, PickupPal feature key stats including a key statistic that they&amp;#8217;ve diverted  38,294,908 lbs of CO2 from the atmosphere. Again, I&amp;#8217;d ask, what does that much CO2 mean? Is it the amount of CO2 emissions by a small country like Latvia (I&amp;#8217;m making this up), is it one Detroit car factory for 3 months? It would be helpful to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out this short, funny video where Dan Heath demonstrates what he means by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brightsightradio.com/podcastDetails.asp?id=342&quot;&gt;concreteness&lt;/a&gt; when he talks about standing out in the online dating world, and how people looking for love miss a key opportunity when they introduce themselves with a lame headline like &amp;#8220;looking for love.&amp;#8221; Another way the Heath&amp;#8217;s make their idea of concreteness more &lt;em&gt;concrete&lt;/em&gt; is on their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.madetostick.com/blog/2008/12/09/tutoring-your-kid-in-math/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; where they offer an example of a six year old doing his math homework. Instead of using abstract figures, a genius parent uses candies, and &lt;em&gt;blam!&lt;/em&gt; her kid turns into a math wiz. Why? Because, as the kid proclaims, “I’m thinking of candies, Mommy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the challenge is how can you turn numbers into candies? How can you stand apart. If you figure this out, I promise you, the results will be sweet.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Jonathan Adler: Manifesting the Manifesto</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/jonathan-adler-manifesting-the-manifesto/"/>

   <id>http://getpoole.com/jonathan-adler-manifesting-the-manifesto</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-1546 alignleft&quot; title=&quot;Screen shot 2009-11-12 at 11.02.26 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Screen-shot-2009-11-12-at-11.02.26-PM2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2009-11-12 at 11.02.26 PM&quot; width=&quot;374&quot; height=&quot;373&quot; /&gt;Creating a succinct statement of your company&amp;#8217;s  purpose can seem like a tedious, unnecessary task. Typically, creating a Mission Statement involves folks holding up for days on a corporate retreat, just to come up with some useless blather that hangs on a plaque in the reception area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jonathanadler.com/shop/manifesto.php&quot;&gt;Jonathan Adler&amp;#8217;s Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;. It is *not *a Mission Statement. In fact, it is the anti-Mission Statement. It is a treatise overflowing with funny, kitchy, and frankly inspiring stuff like &amp;#8220;We believe that when it comes to decorating, the wife is always right. Unless the husband is gay.&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;We believe handcrafted tchotchkes are life-enhancing.&amp;#8221; By the end I&amp;#8217;m gushing and ready to proclaim &amp;#8220;He&amp;#8217;s right goddamn it. He&amp;#8217;s right!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what a Manifesto is intended to do. In fact, the word Manifesto is Latin for &amp;#8220;clear or evident.&amp;#8221; In her blog post on the subject, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brand.blogs.com/mantra/2004/08/writing_a_brand.html&quot;&gt;Jennifer Rice&lt;/a&gt; makes the point that the Manifesto is for &lt;em&gt;everyone:&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8220;it&amp;#8217;s a public declaration, not something that&amp;#8217;s limited to employees. Everyone sees it.&amp;#8221; And as a result it doesn&amp;#8217;t feature &amp;#8220;vague, self-serving statements.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Adler&amp;#8217;s Manifesto is bereft of corporate-speak. And, because it is makes his purpose clear, it is the perfect elixir for those cynical types. Those of us who thought that seeing Jonathan Adler and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jonathanadler.com/shop/home.php?cat=370&quot;&gt;his stuff&lt;/a&gt; everywhere including a recently designed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.barbiecollector.com/shop/shelf.aspx?shelfid=150163&quot;&gt;Barbie Collection &lt;/a&gt;(which he says &amp;#8220;allowed him to finally make amends for decapitating sister&amp;#8217;s Barbie in 1974.&amp;#8221;) and his role on reality show &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.topdesignwiki.com/&quot;&gt;Top Design&lt;/a&gt; made him a big, fat sell-out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He stands for one thing and that is the first point in his Manifesto &amp;#8220;Your home should make you happy.&amp;#8221; His ubiquity is a reflection of his democratic approach to design. If you didn&amp;#8217;t get it before, you sure get it after 22 pithy points. And, if you didn&amp;#8217;t get it the first time, he hits you over the head with his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jonathanadler.com/shop/commandments.php&quot;&gt;10 Commandments of Happy Chic.&lt;/a&gt; His only use of exalted language is  his use of Thou and Thy which is entirely ironic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s what you can take from Jonathan Adler&amp;#8217;s Manifesto:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Be Clear:&lt;/strong&gt; Cut out any word that sounds like marketing/corporate speak. Say it like you&amp;#8217;re talking to your best-friend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Get a Personality: *&lt;/em&gt;Get one and infuse everything you do with that special sauce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Be Audacious: *&lt;/em&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t be afraid of sticking your neck out or starting a fight. At the height of the minimalism, Adler used his Manifesto to  declare minimalism &amp;#8220;a bummer&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Follow-Through:&lt;/strong&gt; Walk the Walk. Once you read his Manifesto you totally get why Adler sells &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jonathanadler.com/shop/product.php?productid=18154&amp;amp;cat=0&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;initial=&quot;&gt;banana Xmas ornaments&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jonathanadler.com/shop/product.php?productid=17989&amp;amp;cat=0&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;initial=&quot;&gt;banana bud vase&lt;/a&gt;s both for under $50&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  *&lt;em&gt;Declare It Again and Again: *&lt;/em&gt;He tells you what he&amp;#8217;s about 10 ways to Sunday. It&amp;#8217;s all over his site, it&amp;#8217;s in all his interviews. He&amp;#8217;s living the Manifesto.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a list of other brands that have written kick-ass Manifestos that are great examples to look to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chipotle.com/#flash/fwi_story&quot;&gt;Chipotle&amp;#8217;s Food With Integrity Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Lance Armstrong &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livestrong.org/site/c.khLXK1PxHmF/b.2661055/k.E8CE/Manifesto.htm&quot;&gt;Livestrong Foundation &lt;/a&gt;(it is also the form of a video)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brucemaudesign.com/#112942&quot;&gt;Bruce Mau Design Incomplete Manifesto for Growth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Awesome Video of John Nese, owner of Soda Pop Stop in LA. Best part is when he says &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s rally bubbled water. If I was to define it in one word it would be happy&amp;#8230;maybe smile.&amp;#8221; He gets marketing and he&amp;#8217;s completely authentic. He confidently says that the key is to &amp;#8220;set yourself apart by providing your customers with something that no one else has.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#8217;s got an opinion AND a spine. He rants on everything from Corn Syrup, Energy Drinks and Big Business. That&amp;#8217;s what really sets him apart.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Irish Authenticity at The Ceili Cottage</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/irish-authenticity-at-the-ceili-cottage/"/>
   <updated>2009-11-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/irish-authenticity-at-the-ceili-cottage</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not a food critic and this is not a restaurant review.  This is about what happens when autheticity matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ceilicottage.com/&quot;&gt;The Ceili Cottage&lt;/a&gt; is a cozy Irish Pub in Toronto&amp;#8217;s Leslieville neigbourhood. In a town known for a string of pubs Irish in name only, The Ceili Cottage strives to deliver a remarkable experience. But, the experience is all in the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, if you needed evidence of Patrick and his wife Alison&amp;#8217;s commitment to all things Irish and Local, the fact that they are providing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gilchristirishdance.com/&quot;&gt;The Gilchrist-Canavan School of Irish Dance&lt;/a&gt; space behind the cottage should be all the proof you need. The additional I&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ceilicottage.com/events.htm&quot;&gt;rish music lessons and a Shucker Club &lt;/a&gt;ought to knock your cynicism out cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, there are tartan blankets distributed when it&amp;#8217;s chilly on the patio, a fine array of Irish beers on tap, pickled eggs on the menu, and oyster shells literally built into the patio floor. Their menu offers a roast dinner on Monday, and then transforms the remaining meat throughout the week (curried on Thursday, broth on Sunday).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is most interesting about Ceili Cottage are the responses it&amp;#8217;s generated. A positive review on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.martiniboys.com/Toronto/The-Ceili-Cottage-nightlife.html&quot;&gt;Martini Boys&lt;/a&gt; generated 24 comments. A negative review on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogto.com/restaurants/ceili-cottage&quot;&gt;Blog T.O&lt;/a&gt; resulted in 84 comments. Given Groundswell&amp;#8217;s 10/9/90 rule these are pretty impressive stats.&amp;lt;!--more--&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These comments seem to fall into 2 camps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Disappointed Downers: Seem overjoyed that Ceili&amp;#8217;s cottage has fallen short in terms of service or food&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Loving Loyalists: Rush to support Ceili&amp;#8217;s Cottage despite whatever shortcomings one may encounter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the basic Vegetarian Conundrum. Take a stand (&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m a vegetarian&amp;#8221;) and many will do whatever it takes yank you off your pedestal (&amp;#8220;what about leather, you wear leather right?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://caplanskys.com/&quot;&gt;Caplansky&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; ran into the same issue. They claimed to be an authentic Jewish deli. 1/2 the world will loved them even though they (sometimes) run out of smoked meat. The others, bash them at every opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#8217;s a brand to do? Both The Ceili Cottage and Caplansky&amp;#8217;s offer some hints at how to maintain authenticity, support the loyalists and quiet the nay sayers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Be Part of the Conversation: Both Zane Caplansky and Patrick McMurray blog, Tweet and respond to comments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Keep Calm and Carry On: Respond to the naysayers with measured calmness. Never lose your cool. Patrick begins his response to some scathing comments on BlogTO with &amp;#8220;Thanks for all of the comments, and the review. All is fair.&amp;#8221; How can you hate a guy like that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Thank the Fans: For his final restaurant review, the Toronto Star&amp;#8217;s Corey Mintz wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestar.com/living/restaurants/article/706467--birthing-pains-last-a-month-at-caplansky-s&quot;&gt;glowing review of Caplansky&amp;#8217;s &lt;/a&gt; and Zane, in turn made a point of thanking &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.caplanskys.com/2009/10/11/we-smoked-em/&quot;&gt;Corey in his blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Don&amp;#8217;t get distracted. The naysayers will always be there whenever you try to do/be something special. But remember, no one bothered to comment on The Pickle Barrel&amp;#8217;s smoked meat or the Irish Stew at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.firkinpubs.com/&quot;&gt;Fox and the Firkin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Facing Meaning</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/facing-meaning/"/>
   <updated>2009-10-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/facing-meaning</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently treated myself to a facial. It is not something I do often because the cost/benefit equation doesn&amp;#8217;t generally make sense to me. In other words, it&amp;#8217;s expensive and I don&amp;#8217;t fool myself into believing that it will produce long-term, radical benefits to my skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspended rational judgment to engage in an experience that would be pleasurable, relaxing and uplifting. In his book&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.ca/Making-Meaning-Successful-Businesses-Experiences/dp/0321374096/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1256667059&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot;&gt; Making Meaning&lt;/a&gt; Nathan Shedroff describes &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.makingmeaning.org/meanings.html&quot;&gt;15 core values&lt;/a&gt; that, leveraged strategically, create meaningful customer experiences. This is a phenomenon Shedroff calls &amp;#8220;meaningful consumption&amp;#8221;  as opposed to &amp;#8220;simply responding based on features, price, brand identity and emotional pitches.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how does this work? The spa experience falls under the meaningful experience Shedroff calls beauty: &amp;#8220;The appreciation of qualities that give pleasure to the senses or spirit.&amp;#8221; The spa I went to seemed well positioned to deliver this meaningful experience. The decor was calming and simple, the products they use (and sell) are all natural, the table I laid on was the ultimate in comfort. &amp;#8220;Bring on the beauty&amp;#8221; my soul cried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The facial was lovely. 15 mins in I looked up and asked &amp;#8220;what kind of facial is this anyway?&amp;#8221; She explained it was called a Simple facial but then noted that my skin looked dehydrated and I should consider the super-hydrating facial. And as an afterthought &amp;#8220;I should tell you, it&amp;#8217;s $20 more.&amp;#8221; And, in the bliss of that moment, I willingly conceded to turn a blind-eye to being super-sized and said yes to the indulgent upgrade.&amp;lt;!--more Continue Reading &amp;raquo;--&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the facial, I was left alone to dress. I saw the spa&amp;#8217;s schedule on the counter. Writ large under my name was: &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;wants simple facial, try to sell super-hydrating.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; Sell? Sell you say? This was about beauty, about my previously-dehydrated, now super-hydrated skin. .My feelings of bliss quickly washed away. Why? Because this crass display of commerce undermined the credibility of my experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other experiences like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  On a day when you&amp;#8217;re feeling particularly adventurous,  your hairdresser talks you into getting $80 highlights you neither need, nor want. When you get home you realize that, contrary to what he told you,  blond highlights don&amp;#8217;t look natural when you&amp;#8217;re a brunette.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  When your experience of a tourist destination is interrupted by far too many tourist shops, calling out for you to buy souvenirs. Charge me for the trip there, charge me for lunch, but don&amp;#8217;t make me feel duped by selling me tchotchkes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  When you suspect your vet, doctor, dentist, etc. is lining his pockets with tests or treatments neither you, nor your pet, really need&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  When a health store beauty product, like&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.burtsbees.ca/&quot;&gt; Burt&amp;#8217;s Bees&lt;/a&gt;, gets bought up and ends up in the aisles of a major pharmacy chain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond thinking about how to design meaningful experiences across a range of touch points, here are some tips that can help brands avoid undermining their best efforts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Consider the long-tail: Sure, those highlights, that up-sell, or x-ray will allow you to pocket the extra dough, but what will it cost you in customer loyalty?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Think about distribution. Some products feel more special when they come from specialty shops.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Decide what you should charge for and what to give away. Give away tea, coffee and the simple things that make the experience more pleasurable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Make the process of paying seamless: The moment when you reach for your wallet is the moment when it can all fall apart. Don&amp;#8217;t make people wait (too much time to think about how much it hurts the bank-account), don&amp;#8217;t surprise them with hidden costs, don&amp;#8217;t crowd the cash with more products (that just makes me feel worse)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Help me, guide me, but don&amp;#8217;t sell me: You can direct me to your blog where you offer tips for exfoliation or whiter teeth, but if you want to retain an ounce of cred, don&amp;#8217;t telemarket to me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Think about what you&amp;#8217;re selling: I&amp;#8217;ve seen foundation being sold in a  Dermatologists office. Makeup and medicine don&amp;#8217;t mix. In fact, it makes you look like you&amp;#8217;re more into beauty that health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  And finally, if there are any unfortunate notes around, just tuck them away so a poor soul like me doesn&amp;#8217;t have to have a perfectly good facial ruined. I wanted to believe. I really did.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Earth Democracy</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/earth-democracy/"/>
   <updated>2009-10-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/earth-democracy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Vandana Shiva is speaking at Hart House in Toronto on October 22nd. If you don&amp;#8217;t know her, she&amp;#8217;s the current VP of Slow Food International, a powerhouse working on important issues that ultimately affect us all. I&amp;#8217;ve reposted the entire invite page from Hart House here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Hart House presents Vandana Shiva&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;October 22, 2009 | 7:00 p.m&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Register by October 9 to win tickets&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.harthouse.utoronto.ca/beta/html/events/shiva.php#register&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t miss the keynote event of Hart House&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.harthouse.ca/foodweek&quot;&gt;World Food Week&lt;/a&gt;: internationally acclaimed author, ecologist, physicist and activist Vandana Shiva will engage audiences in an Earth Democracy discussion &amp;#8211; her philosophy based on inclusion, nonviolence, reclaiming the commons and freely sharing the earth’s resources. At the core of this philosophy is the idea of Food democracy.&amp;lt;!--more--&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shiva is the vice- president of the global organization Slow Food International and the author of such books as Soil Not Oil, Earth Democracy and Stolen Harvest: The Hijacking of the Global Food Supply and one of the leaders of the International Forum on Globalization. She has made numerous appearances in both film &amp;amp; television including &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;One Water&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8220;, &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Flow: For Love of Water&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; and is featured on the PBS NOW documentary entitled &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;On Thin Ice&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8220;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tickets: $15 students, $25 non-students&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;About the Earth Democracy Evening with Vandana Shiva&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web of life is a food web. Today, this web is severely threatened by new technology to manipulate seed and terminate its fertility, by the obsession with monocultures, by the excessive use of oil and petrochemical based inputs, by the diversion of food to make biofuel to run automobiles. In effect we are eating oil and our food is being transformed into oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the world, food riots are taking place. In Mexico there have been tortilla riots. In Italy, pasta protests. In India, people have attacked ration shops in West Bengal. In Mauritania and Mozambique, in Burkina Faso and Senegal, people have descended on streets to fight for food. 33 countries face social unrest due to rising food prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food democracy has become vital to defend people’s food rights. And food democracy is a vital pillar of Earth Democracy. Either we will produce good food for all, working with gaia and her laws, or we will have no food at all. Good food for all is not just possible, it has become a necessity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;About Vandana Shiva&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For physicist, environmental activist, feminist, ecologist and author of a dozen books and over 300 articles Vandana Shiva, “&lt;strong&gt;being change&lt;/strong&gt;” means a life of campaigning for the right of people and our planet to live and thrive, free of the interference of corporate and governmental greed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She does her work by travelling almost constantly to meet with a huge range of people: grassroots organizations of women and farmers, research scientists, governments and corporations. She advises international bodies such as the United Nations, she works on an organic farm in India with other women, and she challenges the richest and most powerful multinational corporations in the world, corporations like Monsanto and Wal-Mart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shiva grew up in the foothills of the Himalayas, and was educated in India and Canada, where she earned a master’s degree in the philosophy of science at Guelph University and a PhD in particle physics at the University of Western Ontario. Returning home from Canada, she was horrified to find ancient forests being ripped out of existence by westerners who wanted to grow apples where the forests had been. She joined the Chipko Movement, grassroots women who were campaigning to save trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, Shiva’s activities have multiplied almost beyond belief. In order to be independent of influence from governments and wealthy corporations, she founded the Research Foundation for Science, Technology and Ecology, which she defines as “a participatory, public interest research organization.” While it now has offices in New Delhi, at first the foundation met in her mother’s cowshed. “When I found global corporations wanted to patent seeds, crops or life forms, I started Navdanya to protect biodiversity, defend farmers’ rights and promote organic farming.” Part of this work now involves conserving and storing heritage seeds.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Authenticity in Social Media: Scalable Intimacy</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/authenticity-in-social-media-scalable-intimacy/"/>
   <updated>2009-10-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/authenticity-in-social-media-scalable-intimacy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scalableintimacy.com/?p=243&amp;amp;success&quot;&gt; Authenticity in Social Media : Scalable Intimacy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just caught a nice post at Michael Troiano&amp;#8217;S Scalable intimacy blog. He was observing the effect of authenticity in social media, taking the success of pundits and luminaries as a barometer. And, appropriately, wondering how this might scale for brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, &lt;em&gt;authenticity&lt;/em&gt; is the answer. Authenticity is the foundation of consistent communication, and of sustainable enthusiasm. It’s what we all crave and respond to. It is the &lt;em&gt;fuel of followship&lt;/em&gt;, in ways visible and not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He points out that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chrisbrogan.com/steal-this-small-business-promotion-idea/&quot;&gt;Chris Brogan&lt;/a&gt; is a natural helper–in real life and in the digital world. &lt;a href=&quot;http://pistachioconsulting.com/a-birthday-wish/&quot;&gt;Laura Fitton&lt;/a&gt; is strong on relationships and empathy comes through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m with him on how havi&amp;lt;!--more--&amp;gt;ng something people can use and sharing it passionately can be infectious. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.conversationagent.com/&quot;&gt;Valeria Maltoni&lt;/a&gt; is a natural conversationalist. She converses. People are touched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of where this is going for brands, well it&amp;#8217;s not pretty. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.1938media.com/category/best/&quot;&gt;Loren Feldman&lt;/a&gt; may be able to embrace his inner asshole, but P&amp;amp;Gs shareholders don&amp;#8217;t want to think about products made by tiny hands in far away places, manufactured and shipped here at the expense of the environment all so Walmart can sell us shit advertisers have to invent needs for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And sure AG Lafley gets it, but authenticity isn&amp;#8217;t a brush you polish turds with, so I don&amp;#8217;t see a sustainable future for brands whose products suck at the core. Not in their current form anyway. They can co-opt values and serve a community as a campaign strategy, a la Dove&amp;#8217;s Campaign for Real Beauty, but if they &amp;#8220;got it&amp;#8221;, it wouldn&amp;#8217;t be a campaign, but a commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#8217;d set up a house in that community, establish themselves as leaders, and lead. Make their marketing about moving the needle on an issue that matters. Make their metrics about statistics related to the issue they&amp;#8217;re addressing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#8217;s a long tail play and the metrics they&amp;#8217;re responsible for now are part of a quarterly returns systems that has them turn a cool, important and well executed idea like Real Beauty into some shit about spas. My wife can tell you more–I stopped paying attention the second they stopped doing shit that matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was the question? Oh yeah. After making the point that great art reveals the artists nature:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That’s why most hip-hop is crap, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blip.fm/profile/MikeTrap/blip/1686721&quot;&gt;Jay-Z is an artist&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 20px; font-size: 12px; color: #323232;&quot;&gt;he says he&amp;#8217;s still peeling the onion on what this means for brands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he gets to the heart of the onion, I think he&amp;#8217;ll find that authenticity only works long term if it goes to the core. Most bloated brands have no soul at that core. There are a lot of cards you can play at and play out, but authenticity is a pretty hard one to fold on.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Sunday Shoots: Art project as marketing</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/sunday-shoots-art-project-as-marketing/"/>
   <updated>2009-08-08T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/sunday-shoots-art-project-as-marketing</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sundayshoots.com/index.html&quot;&gt;Seamus Ryan&amp;#8217;s Sunday Shoots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually noticed this in the new copy of &lt;a class=&quot;zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f8000000000459632&quot; title=&quot;Dwell (magazine)&quot; rel=&quot;homepage&quot; href=&quot;http://www.dwell.com&quot;&gt;Dwell&lt;/a&gt; Magazine and decided to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seamus lets people know what thematic style he&amp;#8217;s setting up for each week and invites the public to show up for portraits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/moz-screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;396&quot; height=&quot;115&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as you&amp;#8217;re OK with the public ordering prints of you (though it&amp;#8217;ll likely only be your relatives),&amp;lt;!--more--&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 800px;&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Picture-6.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;410&quot; height=&quot;280&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and assuming you like the theme, it looks like a great &lt;a class=&quot;zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f80000000001db80e&quot; title=&quot;Marketing strategy&quot; rel=&quot;wikipedia&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_strategy&quot;&gt;marketing strategy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 800px;&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Picture-7.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subjects are happy to have creative and pro portraits.&lt;br&gt;
The effort is noteworthy enough for Dwell Magazine to pick up on it and for me to stop and read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s share-worthy–I mentioned it to a couple of photographers right away and am mentioning it again here.&lt;br&gt;
I bet the the subjects are sharing the story and url over dinner and facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d suggest more social features on the site itself, so people could comment on shots, submit ideas for shoots, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Harrod&amp;#8217;s, The V&amp;amp;A and others like the idea too. Seamus&amp;#8217; blog mentions the various incarnations the gig has been/will be recreated in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Debunking Social Media Myths</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/debunking-social-media-myths/"/>
   <updated>2009-07-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/debunking-social-media-myths</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a very interesting post about the true costs of using social media effectively and the potential rewards David Armano (at the Harvard business blog) covers some great territory but one point stuck out in particular:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;&amp;#8230;Twitter is that the ecosystem it&amp;#8217;s a part of, is itself built on people who keep it humming along with not only content, but a seemingly endless stream of third party applications. This phenomenon is not entirely new&amp;#8211;it&amp;#8217;s been referred to as end-user innovation (innovation by consumers and end users), rather than suppliers.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It strikes a chord with me because enabling &amp;#8220;end-user innovation&amp;#8221; is a brand strategy we believe in. Providing a platform and opportunity for people to share what matters to them is a useful contribution to a community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a lot easier to stay top of mind and build relationships w/audiences and prospects when you&amp;#8217;re collaborating on creating something. The key is to make sure the &amp;#8220;something&amp;#8221; is useful for them. It can be rewarding, an outlet or a stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many non-profits have picked up on this. Even using free resources like the Lance Armstrong Foundation&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/livestrongarmy&quot; title=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/livestrongarmy&quot;&gt;Livestrong YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; can be a useful way for audiences to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumer brands that matter to people are picking up on this too. And I guess Dove&amp;#8217;s campaign around real beauty can be considered a useful attempt by a multinational to make itself memorable by being useful to a community. Though with the amount of artificially affordable &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.storyofstuff.com/&quot; title=&quot;http://www.storyofstuff.com/&quot;&gt;useless crap&lt;/a&gt; they create with tiny hands, ship around the world, and then use fear tactics to market to us, it&amp;#8217;s unlikely the multinationals of the world would be able to sustain such a strategy. They create too many things we simply don&amp;#8217;t need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the take-aways are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Make something a few people need&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Instead of simply blabbing about it, get people to blab about it for you by earning their respect (even gratitude) by making your marketing as useful as your offering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;via &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.harvardbusiness.org/cs/2009/06/debunking_social_media_myths.html&quot;&gt;Debunking Social Media Myths &amp;#8211; Conversation Starter &amp;#8211; HarvardBusiness.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cool commentary on a simple question period with Condoleeza Rice, Stanford students, and a video camera that result in mainstream media attention, public contribution/clarification and information that was all arguably unattainable by reporters while her administration was in office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post references a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.harpers.org/archive/2009/05/hbc-90004883&quot;&gt;Harper&amp;#8217;s article&lt;/a&gt; by Scott Horton that deconstructs Condi&amp;#8217;s comments as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a sea of information, we are, more often than not, inundated with images that tell us what we don&amp;#8217;t need nor want to know. I could care less about half the statistical info that&amp;#8217;s thrown my way everyday, unless it&amp;#8217;s presented like &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogof.francescomugnai.com/2009/04/50-great-examples-of-infographics/&quot;&gt;this…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This fun little script helps turn your limited larder into meal–either add twitter or use the site:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;if you’re on Twitter, you can talk to Twecipe like this: “@twecipe broccoli, carrots, beef” and you’ll get a response like this: “Try Beef and Vegetable Pie http://twecipe.com/_kaw”. If you’re not on Twitter, you can use the site. And that’s it! A quick and handy way to get quick and handy recipes.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick sample:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;#8220;Today, I returned home from college and saw a framed picture of my parents and my younger sister on an elephant in an exotic jungle. I pointed to the picture and asked my mom, &amp;#8220;Is this some photoshop job?&amp;#8221; She responded, &amp;#8220;No, we went to Thailand for a family trip, didn&amp;#8217;t we tell you? FML&amp;#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;#8220;Today, I saw a elderly man fall in a crosswalk, so I jumped off my bike to help. As I helped him across, the light turned green. At that point I noticed my phone had fallen out of my pocket in the street and was run over by several cars. I then watched across a 6 lane street as someone stole my bike. FML&amp;#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;date&quot; style=&quot;float: left;&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;#8220;Today, after class, my teacher pulled me aside and said &amp;#8220;You know, I never received the e-mail regarding your disabilities that your parents mentioned. Could you have them resend it?&amp;#8221; What disabilities? FML&amp;#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

I wasn&amp;amp;#8217;t included. Apparently I had been fired and they forgot to tell me. FML&amp;amp;#8221;
    &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; 

    &amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;post&amp;quot;&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
        &amp;amp;#8220;Today, I went to Macy&amp;amp;#8217;s to go shopping, I was wearing a shirt and tie and dressed nicely. Customers came to for questions, but I just ignored them. Minutes later, thinking I was an employee, the manager came and yelled at me, and threatened to fire me. FML&amp;amp;#8221;
      &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

   <title>Social networking return?</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/social-networking-return/"/>
   <updated>2009-02-20T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/social-networking-return</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just came across this article for freelancers about the value/return of spending time engaged in Social media. &lt;br&gt;
The Author glazes over the benefits for larger businesses, but it got my wheels turning. Here are his comments–mine are below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;First, just skip the marketing-centric, revenue-generating B2B/B2C user who recognizes the potential in social media, so they tap into like it was the Klondike.  For these users, social interaction is a business decision, and going social is often associated with a brand or product to result in revenue.  Identifying &lt;em&gt;why &lt;/em&gt;they’re using social media is easy – it’s &lt;em&gt;money.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you throw out the marketers, it&amp;#8217;s worth pointing out that marketing is changing in certain ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, organizations are in business to make money and employees have limited time to spare (I run a design co and none of us have time for the twitterholes we get stuck in). And yes, businesses should consider the relative cost of a sale. But in that the lines of direct communication have been facilitated–in that (good and bad) word spreads faster than ever, and in that some of the most vocal, intelligent, and affluent prospects are engaging in social media (and no longer passively consuming broadcast media)–people with things to sell should be wading into the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trick is–like all marketing (and investing for that matter), to be patient, transparent and let go of the reins–you were never really driving anyway. This two way system is not controlled by media giants, there is no safety zone, and you are totally exposed. There is equal opportunity for your organization to shine as long as you genuinely have something useful to offer. Social media channels may not be the Klondike, but since the communication is happening online, more like the Wild west.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.carbongraffiti.com/notebook/2008/12/16/how-do-we-measure-return-from-our-social-networking/&quot;&gt;How do we measure return from our social networking? | CarbonGraffiti &amp;#8211; Email, Online Marketing &amp;amp; Web Design&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In what looks like an ultra cool boon to homeowners and power consumers everywhere, Google&amp;#8217;s making a gadget to help us track our consumption with a view to making better decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two big ideas are that knowing the effect of each thing you power is the first step to making decisions about needs vs. wants. I&amp;#8217;ve always wondered whether I should let my computer go to sleep or shut it down for the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second big idea is that the aggregated information from participants gives everyone a more relevant benchmark. Finding out what people in my neighbourhood with similar needs, conditions and appliances are paying sounds like some much needed perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Expressive Capital–A clue for social media?</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/expressive-capital-a-clue-to-social-media/"/>
   <updated>2009-02-07T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/expressive-capital-a-clue-to-social-media</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hugh at Cluetrain wrote a cool summary of the history of brand influence. The point being that the newest model, which he calls &amp;#8220;expressive capital&amp;#8221;, is manifest in brands taking the &amp;#8220;Love Mark&amp;#8221; to a new level by allowing people to believe something about themselves–to bring context to their beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;First we had Human Capital.&lt;/strong&gt; You There Go to the next village and kill everybody because I&amp;#8217;m the Chief of this village and I say so etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Then came Physical Capital.&lt;/strong&gt; Land, property, factories etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Then came Financial Capital.&lt;/strong&gt; Money, credit, dollars etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; *&lt;em&gt;Then came Intellectual Capital. *&lt;/em&gt;Our widgets are better than your widgets because our engineers are smarter than your engineers etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Then came Emotional Capital.&lt;/strong&gt; People love our product more than they love our competitor&amp;#8217;s product etc. This is the space &amp;#8220;Love Marks&amp;#8221; plays around with so successfully: &amp;#8220;A Love Mark is a brand that is loved by its user beyond reason&amp;#8221; etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;em&gt;**Expressive Capital.&lt;/em&gt;* Our products make it easier for the end user to find and/or express meaning, narrative, metaphor, purpose, explanation and relevance in his/her own life than our competitor&amp;#8217;s products.*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a bit like Seth Godin&amp;#8217;s riff in &amp;#8220;All Marketers are Liars&amp;#8221;, where he suggests that it&amp;#8217;s the marketer&amp;#8217;s job to frame the offer/experience along lines that sync with consumers&amp;#8217; hard-coded &amp;#8220;world views&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It got me thinking that neither idea goes far enough for today&amp;#8217;s consumer climate. Instead of simply helping people believe something, find or express meaning/purpose, why not help them DO something? I mean partner with their customers to shift the needle on some point?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess the version of  &amp;#8220;Social Marketing&amp;#8221; that helps corporations leverage their Philanthropy strategically touches in this area –CIBC&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Run for the Cure&amp;#8221;, Ronald McDonald House and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/000823.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/zzzzzz7654122.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timberland&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;City Year&amp;#8221; are successful examples of this. But making sure you don&amp;#8217;t come off as capitalizing on the cause must be a tough line to tow. And even in these examples, how many people remember which non-profits are the beneficiaries?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media is a boon to marketers who want to pay attention to what their prospects deem worthy of espressing publicly. And of course it&amp;#8217;s an unheralded opportunity for nimble organizations who &amp;#8220;get it&amp;#8221; to enage directly with their buying public for feedback on successes, failures and opportunities. But wouldn&amp;#8217;t it be cool to find out about a brand who was using social media to partner with their public–as citizens in a community of interest, to fix something they felt was broken?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m going to investigate instances where a brand is teeming up with the public to change the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sure it&amp;#8217;e being done. Patagonia, or Trek– someone who emplys people that enjoy the outdoors (and partake) must be protecting some geographic region or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here&amp;#8217;s the original link.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1050&quot; title=&quot;picture-16&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/picture-16.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture-16&quot; width=&quot;519&quot; height=&quot;65&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is filled with many different coloring instruments. But I buy &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crayola.com&quot;&gt;Crayola&lt;/a&gt;. I could buy colored pencils at the dollar store or smelly markers at Walmart. But, I don&amp;#8217;t.  I buy Crayola markers for one reason&amp;#8211;they wipe off. That&amp;#8217;s what parents care about. When your 2 year old hits the kitchen cabinets with a Magenta marker, you are grateful to those genius chemists at Crayola who figured out how to make a marker that wipes off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe the others do and I just don&amp;#8217;t know about it. But they didn&amp;#8217;t say it on their packaging and I&amp;#8217;m not willing to take that chance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a brilliant case of knowing your market and knowing what they care about. Who buys markers? Not kids. Parents, and more specifically, moms do.  All markers color. Only one brand wipes off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crayola.com&quot;&gt;Crayola website&lt;/a&gt; doesn&amp;#8217;t even mention this incredible benefit. There have to be some great stories parents could tell about wiping crayons off the walls and worshiping at the alter of Crayola for making stuff that comes off. Looking at other peoples&amp;#8217; mess would feel good for once. There Crayola, I just gave you your next great idea. A social campaign focusing on Crayola&amp;#8217;s wipe-ability.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-1034&quot; title=&quot;hypenotic_patttyhewes1&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/hypenotic_patttyhewes1-500x375.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;hypenotic_patttyhewes1&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I happened to mention on twitter a few characters&amp;#8217; names from one of my favourite shows, &lt;em&gt;Damages&lt;/em&gt;. The next day I found I was being followed by the lead character herself, Patty Hewes [played wonderfully by Glenn Close].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose I opened myself to such a follow. All the marketers have to do is search twitter for any reference to the show, and bang, you&amp;#8217;re sent a message from your latest follower. I can choose not to follow back, but I&amp;#8217;m curious to see if the plot will advance any more than on the show itself. Will I learn anything that tv viewers won&amp;#8217;t? If you know the show, it&amp;#8217;s full of twists and turns and cryptic story lines, which—unlike &lt;em&gt;Lost&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Heroes&lt;/em&gt;—actually work well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to give props to the marketers for using this social medium to keep viewers interested between episodes. And I have the option to ignore it, which isn&amp;#8217;t always possible with advertising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know her character, you&amp;#8217;ll realize Patty Hewes actually isn&amp;#8217;t one likely to take time to tweet, but my curiosity has certainly been piqued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I do love a sexy site. Very slick. And it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; kinda funny. Too bad the pay-off isn&amp;#8217;t as attractive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this an effective marketing tactic?&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2008-12-24T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/handmade-tale</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/dirtyhands.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;dirtyhands&quot; title=&quot;dirtyhands&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;334&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-952&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been working on a handmade gift this season for my brother-in-law, who&amp;#8217;s also a designer. Tough to create something for a another creator. I felt under a lot of pressure to represent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was nice about working on this project was the feeling of being an artist again. Many commercial designers spend a lot of time at their desks and not at a table with glue and scissors. It was great to get my hands dirty and feel a real sense of accomplishment once it was all done [although the clean-up was a bitch; it&amp;#39;s certainly easier to shut down your computer than wipe away glue and sawdust from every surface in your kitchen]. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had been dreading creating this gift, and the idea only came to me a few days ago, which didn&amp;#8217;t leave me a lot of time to execute. Had I given myself more time, the project would have come out that much better [although it&amp;#39;s still pretty nice as is]. But once I got started, the feeling of making something by hand for a loved one was very satisfying, and I kept thinking that I was much happier covered in glue and paper in my socks than trapped in a mall spending too much money and energy. Plus I garnered a lot of inspiration for future work, for both 2d and 3d projects, which was a nice side-effect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also hand-assembled Hypenotic&amp;#8217;s holiday client treats, which surrounded my desk with cut paper, raffia, freshly-designed labels, etc. Being so out of the loop from the handmade business [I used to self-produce greeting cards], it took a lot longer than I expected, but it turned out to be great fun, and again, very fulfilling. Nice to make something for someone that has some true love in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These harsher financial times have forced us to get back to basics. Craft and handmade-goods businesses are seeing a boom this holiday season as people move away from mindless spending and toward true inspiration. We go through so many days wondering how we got by without our machines and when the internet goes down for whatever reason, we feel helpless and useless. Time to get over that and force ourselves to use our brains and our hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So get out and get dirty. Make something. Anything. For you. For someone else. You&amp;#8217;ll be surprised at how well it pays off.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Social Media: Noise that matters</title>

&lt;p&gt;Seth says social media matters because paying attention to your vocal fringe can give you insight into what&amp;#8217;s coming and a chance to please the people you want to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The noise makes it far easier than it has ever been before to hear the thunder in the distance, to get early indications of what the fringes of the market are about to spread to the rest.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;em&gt;watch the hi-res clip here at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bewareofthedoghouse.com/video.aspx&quot;&gt;doghouse site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say I&amp;#8217;m impressed with the quality of online productions these days. The ante has been upped by agencies who have realized that the internet is a viable medium for video marketing, and that consumers are a lot more discerning than previously imagined. These are heavy challengers to the youtube crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Doghouse&lt;/em&gt; is the recently launched campaign by JC Penny, created by Saatchi &amp;#038; Saatchi NY in collaboration with Razorfish. The high quality of the online video helps take the sting out of the fact that you&amp;#8217;re watching an ad for mid-range retailer JC Penny [and their jewelry department at that. I&amp;#39;d have to say that if my husband bought me jewelry from JC Penny, the Doghouse is where he would &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt; to wind up].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The campaign also includes Facebook Connect that allows FB users to place their network friends in the poocher; plus the ability to send email notifications to those facing banishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cliché idea of putting your man in the doghouse is not one I subscribe to, nor usually find funny, but this did make me laugh, and big ups to the creative minds behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What better gift than passing on valuable knowledge so future mistakes can be avoided?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Filmmaker &amp;amp; photographer Andrew Zuckerman teamed up with Desmond Tutu to create the Wisdom Project. Both a book and movie, the project culls well known and interesting personalities [&lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; people, not silly celebrities] in order to hear what they would pass on to future generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film is beautifully shot and a must see, as is the Making Of doc and both are available on the website, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wisdombook.org/&quot;&gt;wisdombook.org&lt;/a&gt;. They are fairly short, so take the time to grab a cup of tea, sit down and watch.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Making Multimedia Work</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/making-multimedia-work/"/>
   <updated>2008-11-27T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/making-multimedia-work</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Most arts organizations grossly underutilize the power of multimedia to add a whole new dimension to their art form (with funding being what it is, most arts organizations have pitiful websites, never mind multimedia.) But, multimedia has the power to add layers of meaning and understanding to the performing arts and, in turn, get &amp;#8216;bums in seats.&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is common knowledge that younger folks lack interest in symphony. The San Francisco Symphony&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keepingscore.org/web.html&quot;&gt;Keeping Score&lt;/a&gt; initiative is tackling this issue. With dedicated websites on compositions by Beethoven, Stravinsky and Copeland they make the most of the media by offering fun, interactive opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try your hand at being a conductor for Stravinsky&amp;#8217;s Right of Spring. Practice modulation like Beethoven did. The deeper you dig the more you find. It&amp;#8217;s rather addictive. And, the web is integrated into a program that includes TV, radio, classroom workshops. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a lesson how to keep the arts relevant to audiences who may not pick up a haughty brochure or read symphony reviews in the paper. It&amp;#8217;s not just about adding a facebook link or making concerts available on youtube. It&amp;#8217;s about making the medium work for your intended audience.&lt;/p&gt;

Large scale terrorist attacks seem only like an excuse to violate a citizen&amp;#8217;s rights to freedoms. Britons have it especially bad, being constantly watched via CCTV, so it&amp;#8217;s not surprising that projects like Big Brother State are coming to the fore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;oh, and it&amp;#8217;s beautifully animated by German-based &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huesforalice.com&quot;&gt;David Scharf&lt;/a&gt;. A must-see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Came across the art of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.notoart.com/FineArtfr.html&quot;&gt;Phil Noto&lt;/a&gt;, who has made it to my list of top favourite illustrators. So reminiscent of Tatsuo Yoshida of &lt;em&gt;Gatchaman&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mach Go Go Go&lt;/em&gt; fame. Classic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Led me to the idea for my next tattoo: Jun [or Princess, if you watched it as &lt;em&gt;Battle of the Planets&lt;/em&gt;] on my wrist. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;

In their new campaign to promote awareness, they have partnered with Aardman Animations of Wallace &amp;amp; Grommet fame, creating online games and videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d like to see more of these types of games — not only does it expand the player universe, but helps others gain a better understanding of the value of things many of us take for granted.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Nielsen on Agile development</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/nielsen-on-agile-development/"/>
   <updated>2008-11-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Summary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agile methods aim to overcome usability barriers in traditional development, but pose new threats to user experience quality. By modifying Agile approaches, however, many companies have realized the benefits without the pain&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short: Agility without usability is bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Agile&amp;#8217;s biggest threat to system quality stems from the fact that it&amp;#8217;s a method &lt;strong&gt;proposed by programmers&lt;/strong&gt; and mainly addresses the implementation side of system development. As a result, it often overlooks interaction design and usability, which are left to happen as a side effect of the coding. This, of course, contradicts all experience of the last 30 years, in which user experience&amp;#8217;s importance in system development has steadily increased as we moved from mainframes to PCs to the Web. As the user base and the use cases have expanded, the need for top-notch usability has grown.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very exciting for designers. He advocates the use of paper prototypes to keep the flow of the user&amp;#8217;s expereince cohesive in the face of one feature at a time development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nielsen also recommends pre-planned weekly usbaility tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read it [from the horse&amp;#8217;s mouth.][1]&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The kids are alright</title>

   <updated>2008-11-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/the-kids-are-alright</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently read Carl Honoré&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/067697841X/&quot;&gt;Under Pressure: Rescuing Childhood from the Culture of Hyper-Parenting. &lt;/a&gt;This book signals the arrival of what I see as a new trend. For years, parents have been bombarded with toys and props designed to make our children, from infancy,  smarter and more stimulated. Prompted by the incredible success of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.babyeinstein.com/tenyears/&quot;&gt;Baby Einstein&lt;/a&gt;, companies like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fisherprice.com&quot;&gt;Fisher Price&lt;/a&gt; jumped on the bandwagon, with sub-brands like &amp;#8220;Play and Learn,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Laugh and Learn.&amp;#8221; The operative word always being *learn. *I see something new on the horizon, and it looks alot like something old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parents.com/fun/toys/toy-fair/2008-toy-fair-trends/&quot;&gt;Parenting Magazines&amp;#8217; Toy Trends 2008&lt;/a&gt; lists Eco Toys as the #1 trend. The #5 trend is &amp;#8220;Back to Basics&amp;#8221; toys described as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;from straight-from-the-woodshop block sets by Tree Blocks (so natural, some still have bark), to Front Porch Classic&amp;#8217;s wooden Classic Magic 8 Ball, wooden toys have simple, sturdy, just-like-I-used-to-have appeal.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/may/03/familyandrelationships.usa&quot;&gt;Baby Einstein backlash &lt;/a&gt;is nothing new (did anyone really think those movies made kids smarter???), research has long indicated that none of these brand promises result in brainier babies. What is new is a viable alternative. The slow food, green and local movements (not to mention lead-tainted toys from China)  have created a new zeitgeist that promises a new approach to kids&amp;#8217; entertainment. And not a moment too soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A front runner in this trend is&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oompa.com/&quot;&gt; Oompa Toys&lt;/a&gt;. With a tag-line reading: &amp;#8220;No batteries. No blinking lights. No cartoon-themed toys. Period&amp;#8221; they have a solid focus and clear, honest communications. Not to mention fantastic toys. They&amp;#8217;ve just opened their first store in Wisconsin. If I&amp;#8217;ve got this right, it&amp;#8217;ll be the first of many.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://getpoole.com/whole-foods-next-niche</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Jackie Huba at the &amp;#8220;Church of the Customer&amp;#8221; Blog has an interesting discussion going on what Whole Foods might do for it&amp;#8217;s next act. Now that your average chain offers organic, how can they compete without getting into a price-war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She makes a good case for them to focus on special needs diets. it&amp;#8217;s a large niche with multiple audiences and they have plenty of avenues to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know the benefits of a niche focus, but I wonder if WholeFoods specialty isn&amp;#8217;t broader–an experience. Everything about the place communicates a passion and respect for food and nourishment. An diet related accessibilty program just seems to be a manifestation of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.churchofthecustomer.com/blog/2008/11/whole-foods-nex.html&quot;&gt;Whole Foods&amp;#8217; next niche?: Church of the Customer Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>VizDay: Case Studies in Visualization</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocad.ca/about_ocad/news_events/vizday08.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-434 aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;visday-2008&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/visday-2008.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;440&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A glimpse into what&amp;#8217;s up on the academic side of the visualization universe. An interesting (and free!) day-long symposium at OCAD that showed off various examples of high-end data visualization tools &amp;amp; techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One unexpectedly cool nugget was tucked into a footnote to a presentation on the business and technical challenges of data visualization/opportunity modeling in the mining industry. It was &lt;a href=&quot;http://vis.cs.ucdavis.edu/%7Eogawa/codeswarm/&quot;&gt;CodeSwarm&lt;/a&gt;, a way of looking at the evolution of a collaborative software development process by visualizing the contributions to a svn repository over time. I can only imagine what it might look like to run this on Wikipedia&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the other interesting stuff included the mind-boggling sophistication (real-time modelling of gigabytes of data &lt;em&gt;per second&lt;/em&gt; anyone?) of open-source visualization toolkits like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paraview.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ParaView&lt;/a&gt; (some amazing animations at the bottom of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paraview.org/paraview/project/imagegallery.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; page), and a sister project &lt;a href=&quot;http://paraviewgeo.mirarco.org/index.php/Main_Page&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ParaViewGeo&lt;/a&gt; specifically for geophysics/mining. An eye-opener for anyone who thinks open-source is limited to web tools, and a compelling business case for open-source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting project was &lt;a href=&quot;http://cluster.cis.drexel.edu/~cchen/citespace/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CiteSpace&lt;/a&gt;, a tool for visually exploring the relationships between pulbished scientific papers. By tracking the complex relationships between citations, topic, authors &amp;amp; institutions patterns of discovery and intellectual influence begin to emerge. Becoming fluent in the interpretations of these patterns could be a novel way to identify which discoveries are destinined to be very important &amp;#8211; something that can be hard to see given the incredible degrees of specialization in scientific research &amp;#8211; ideas can often get lost in the sea of knowledge, and may not float to the surface for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CiteSpace illustrates another dilemma: despite the sophistication of the tool itself, the underlying programming and the richness of the data, the UI of the software is not friendly or intuitive at all. Furthermore, the visualization itself, while rich with data and parameter controls, does not convey it&amp;#8217;s meaning directly, but rather requires interpretation through a coded language of colour &amp;amp; symbols. And man, thier website is an academic eyesore. How can such sophisitcated thinking end up looking so bad?* What these guys need is a graphic designer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(* I think there is a kind of academic anti-aesthetic snobbery, wherein something that looks too good (a whiff of &amp;#8216;slick&amp;#8217;, the taint of commercialization) won&amp;#8217;t be taken as seriously as something that was created by someone who appears to have more &amp;#8216;important&amp;#8217; things to worry about than the design of their papers/charts/website, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the roundtable discussion, it seemed that many scientists and engineers, when approaching the final layer of visual manifestation of thier ideas, got stuck on the question of how/why they should design the visualization a particluar way. There was talk of the mysteries of the rhetoric of the visual language used to convey meaning&amp;#8230; Hey, wait a minute! Isn&amp;#8217;t that exacly what graphic design is?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graphic design process is about making decision to enhance the commincations of ideas through a visual rhetoric of colour, layout, type, hierarchy, composition, etc. Designers are the scientists of qualitative visualization, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735711658/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;making the invisible visible&lt;/a&gt;, defining and articulating our shared visual language. In the same way that we dig into clients business challenges and audiences emotional world and then use our visual and conceptual toolkit to make the connections between them, I see an important role for designers as collaborators with the scientific community. There is a lot we can offer to help make scientific results more intelligible, tools more usable, implications more evident; design can help reduce conceptual signal-to-noise without over-simplifying (as seemed to be one concern). Knowlege, scientific or otherwise, is ultimated require to make decisions, often by people outside the specialized fields where that knowlege came from. Graphic designers have exactly the skills required to translate complex, tangled ideas into something that can communicate more immediately, more intuitively and more universally. We help turn knowledge into understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Georgeous work on display over at grain edit (mind-bending source of inspiration) by Czech illustrator Miroslav Sasek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/miroslav-sasek-nations-81.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;This is the United Nations&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve always wondered why school wasn&amp;#8217;t composed of illustrated work and documentaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember the words to 1000s of songs and the relationships and histories of the band members. I can describe scenes and plots in intricate detail from hundreds of movies. Between grade 4 and university I devoured 50% of the sci-fi, fantasy, and espionage/adventure sections of my library. I can tell you the secret origin of hundreds of superheroes and recount countless plots from their pages. I&amp;#8217;ve been stopped and informed by innumerable posters. I could go on, but the more I think it about it the angrier I get that texbooks and education in general suck as badly as they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here&amp;#8217;s a link to some books I&amp;#8217;m going to find for my daughters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I sport my own ink, I am more aware of ink on others than I ever was, so when I come across something of this calibre, I have to share. I think the art can be appreciated whether you’ve got your own tattoo or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When tattoos and high photography come together, I’ve got my fix for the day. Julie Becker is the subject of this photo spread for Inked Magazine, and what’s interesting is that she’s not just the model, but a tattoo artist herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out this amazing spread &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inkedmag.com/fashion/17/1/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; [I would love to know 1. who the photographer was, and 2. who does her ink].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out Becker’s work &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.juliebeckerink.com/&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m here to stand up for children and childhood. Parents, I understand your modern aesthetic. Everything has to be minimal. Your couches are white and your children are kept prisoner in the basement so their dirty little fingers don&amp;#8217;t mess with your oh-so-zen decor. Okay, fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well people, this is where I draw the line. I was willing to stomach the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.babble.com/CS/blogs/droolicious/archive/2008/11/10/iconic-ghost-chair-gets-resized-for-kids.aspx&quot;&gt;child-sized Starck Ghost Chair&lt;/a&gt;, but now I&amp;#8217;m pissed. Let me put it plainly,  if you find yourself craving this $100  Bruno Limberger-designed ash-wood coin bank&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/picture-34.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-425 alignleft&quot; style=&quot;border: 20px solid white;&quot; title=&quot;picture-34&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/picture-34.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;287&quot; height=&quot;227&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwr.com/&quot;&gt;Design Within Reach&lt;/a&gt;, we need to have a little talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel a little like Chris Farley, but I&amp;#8217;ll say it anyway:  &amp;#8220;FOR GOD SAKES, LET THE KID HAVE A PIGGY BANK!&amp;#8221; And by the way, please get over yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>From DotCom to DotGov: Obama’s Online Transition</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/from-dotcom-to-dotgov-obamas-online-transition/"/>
   <updated>2008-11-12T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/from-dotcom-to-dotgov-obamas-online-transition</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Rob Salkowitz shares some interesting thoughts on what made the Obama campaign the social media juggernaut it was and considers what happens with that energy next.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/picture-5.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/picture-5-587x500.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Changegov&quot; width=&quot;587&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-372&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my part, I heard an American organizer abroad, who&amp;#8217;s role was to galvanize interest among Americans in Canada speak on CBC. He postulated that if the community rousing machinery that he saw in place during the campaign could be kept in place during the administration, real change might actually happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The campaign Website operated as a fundraising channel of unparalleled effectiveness, but that’s only the beginning. According to Marc Ambinder, a political columnist for the Atlantic Monthly, the personalized version of the site, MyBarackObama.com (MyBO), was built on three core principles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Enthusiasm: Firing up the Obama faithful with a constant stream of new information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Technology: Including forward-leaning use of blogs, social networking, text messaging, rich media content, geocoding, and tagging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Approach: Essentially online community building, or what an Obama aide called “accountable empowerment,” allowing volunteers to track their activities, share information with their friends, and gain rewards and recognition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Dean’s earlier effort, or the Web programs of his opponents, Obama’s team never seemed to see the Internet audience as a novelty to be exploited or an annoyance to be tolerated. Rather, the social media channels reinforced the other strategic objectives of the campaign and connected directly to measured outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the president-elect pivots from campaigning to governing, his transition site, Change.gov, appears to embody the same combination of 21st-century tech savvy and old fashioned political organizing acumen. The new site, just days old, is meticulously designed and aggregates news, information resources, a blog (with embedded media), a place to “tell your story,” and an online form to apply for jobs in the new administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What will be really interesting to watch is how the Obama presidency continues to use online channels to build and mobilize support for its programs. The campaign raised enormous expectations and unleashed the pent-up enthusiasm of millions of people hungry for change.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.internetevolution.com/author.asp?section_id=697&amp;amp;doc_id=167750&quot;&gt;Internet Evolution &amp;#8211; Rob Salkowitz &amp;#8211; From DotCom to DotGov: Obama&amp;#8217;s Online Transition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A live lesson in Social Media</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/a-live-lesson-in-social-media/"/>
   <updated>2008-11-12T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/a-live-lesson-in-social-media</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve checked in on this conversation surrounding Pepsi&amp;#8217;s new bottles a bit over the last couple of months, but last night I got hooked on one of the centres of the debate. I read all 39 comments in a really interesting discussion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not going to recap the whole story here–discover it along with the commenters and participants for an informative, entertaining, and articulate peek at a big commodity brand&amp;#8217;s foray into social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had to take away one message, I&amp;#8217;d say it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;get involved&amp;#8221;. Decide what you&amp;#8217;d like to find out and start the conversation. There&amp;#8217;s nothing like letting interested parties get you ink, and I love the poetry of giving up control of your brand (it was illusory anyway). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not a fan of teeth-rotting/obesity inducing, land-fill filling coloured water myself, but I can&amp;#8217;t deny the humanizing effect of watching a giant take baby-steps. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theharteofmarketing.com/2008/10/social-media-inside-the-echo-chamber.html#comments&quot;&gt;Conversation I read last night.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The (honestly) always interesting Valeria Maltoni&amp;#8217;s participation in the actual exercise was where I first enjoyed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.conversationagent.com/2008/10/your-logo-is-a-symbol-your-product-can-be-a-social-object.html&quot;&gt;a take on the story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Brand New is another place to get some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/pepsi_new_bottles.php&quot;&gt;in-depth insight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy,&lt;br&gt;

   <id>http://getpoole.com/adfreak</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a great ad that reminds you that zoo animals aren&amp;#8217;t stuffed variety, or animated images, but real living breathing beings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/hogle-large.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-313&quot; title=&quot;hogle-large&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/hogle-large-346x500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;346&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wonder what the carnivorous animals at the zoo are thinking of you when youre gawking at them? An ad for Salt Lake Citys Hogle Zoo via Richter7 of that city has the answer. See the full ad here. Itd probably be best not to aggravate the situation by using bacon dental floss as part of your oral-hygiene regimen before heading off to the zoo.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Office PDX: The mix is the message</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/office_pdx.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-206&quot; title=&quot;office_pdx&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/office_pdx.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;332&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Beyond running a traditional communications design firm, Office PDX is a part of the fabric of design culture by running a specialty design store, art gallery and event space. They&amp;#8217;ll also help outfit your office with furniture and fixtures, and consult on further needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure a lot of people do extra-curricular stuff, but their moonlighting is totally inline with the story they&amp;#8217;re trying to tell about themselves. And it&amp;#8217;s a cool reminder that social media marketing is not strictly a digital process. They&amp;#8217;ve injected themselves into the conversation handsomely. Put themselves in a position to travel by word of mouth and in bits. This post is proof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/picture-4.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-207&quot; title=&quot;Office Interior&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/picture-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;330&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was there a couple of weeks ago, Met Tony, and envied what he&amp;#8217;d created. Better prices for all the design paraphernalia alone makes their lifestyle attractive. He sheepishly but proudly displayed the spread where Office is covered in the October issue of How Magazine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had me thinking about an Office YYZ there for a minute, but I think we&amp;#8217;re on the road to manifesting our variation of a mix of experiences that becomes our marketing.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/gluegun1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Saw a giant billboard on the side of a bus for the Christmas &lt;a title=&quot;oneofakind&quot; href=&quot;http://www.oneofakindshow.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;One of A Kind Show&lt;/a&gt;. With a huge local movement afoot, it&amp;#8217;s hard for a huge empire like One of A Kind to feel authentic. Even if you didn&amp;#8217;t know that it&amp;#8217;s owned by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mmart.com/mmart/&quot;&gt;Merchandise Mart Properties Inc. &lt;/a&gt;in Chicago you would notice the horrible crowds, the overpriced tickets and the bad crafts (because the booths are so expensive, real crafts people can&amp;#8217;t afford to go.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This holiday season, there are reams of truly local craft shows that support local artists. This one at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gladstonehotel.com/exhibitiondetail.cfm?id=869&quot;&gt;Gladstone&lt;/a&gt; caught my eye. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a strong local movement afoot, it&amp;#8217;ll be a challenge for One of a Kind to keep a foothold in this market. Want to know how to do it well? Just ask &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.etsy.com/&quot;&gt;Etsy&lt;/a&gt;. They are all about helping craftspeople do their job well. They do everything in their power to help them market themselves better. They have a&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.etsy.com/community.php&quot;&gt; whole community section&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to craftspeople.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, you can be big and small at the same time. You just gotta be smart.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Conventional gyms are a total turnoff. The promotions make you feel ripped off; the staff make you feel duped; the space makes you feel like a total loser. Not very motivating. If working out makes you feel good, you do it. These places don&amp;#8217;t make me feel like working out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total opposition is the YMCA. Now this is a brand that lives its mission across every touchpoint. It&amp;#8217;s not about ads or promotions. It&amp;#8217;s about doing the right thing for members and the community time and again. It&amp;#8217;s a feel-good place and experience. It makes me want to work out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why am I having a love affair with the Y? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; One flat fee for membership makes me feel like I&amp;#8217;ve been treated fairly. It&amp;#8217;s not cheap, but I don&amp;#8217;t mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The space is open, low-key without all the mirrors and bells and whistles. I feel relieved by the lack of pretension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; I twice hear staff explain how lower income members could have their membership fees adjusted. I believe I am part of a community-based organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; There&amp;#8217;s childcare and an amazing kids&amp;#8217; club and play structure where my kids can hang out while mommy gets a little bit of a workout. They understand and care about my realities. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The staff are helpful. Twice, two different staff people didn&amp;#8217;t just point me in the right direction&amp;#8230;they walked me there. I feel like these people actually give a crap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lessons here are pretty simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      It&amp;#8217;s not what you say, it&amp;#8217;s what you do. &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
          Lots of gyms tell me they want me to go to the gym after I pay my dues, but very few make me feel like they understand what I need. To work out I need childcare, helpful staff, a fair price I know is the same one as the guy sweating on the StairMaster beside me.
        &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    
    &lt;li&gt;
      It&amp;#8217;s not about money. It&amp;#8217;s about value for money. Most people are willing to pay for a positive experience with a brand they&amp;#8217;re proud to associate with.  &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
          The fact that the Y wants to prorate it&amp;#8217;s membership fees based on what people can afford makes me proud. The many ways it tells me it&amp;#8217;s part of the community makes me proud.
        &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  
  &lt;div&gt;
    The sweating part sucks. But, the gym doesn&amp;#8217;t. What a relief.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>The Digital Revolution will not be televised</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/the-real-digital-revolution/"/>
   <updated>2008-11-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/the-real-digital-revolution</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/2cwrjc00.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-103 alignleft&quot; title=&quot;noise&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/2cwrjc00.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alan Volk, who&amp;#8217;s &lt;a title=&quot;The Toad Stool by Alan Wolk &quot; href=&quot;http://tangerinetoad.blogspot.com/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;#8217;ve been enjoying for a few weeks now led me to an interesting article he wrote for AdWeek (a few months ago) called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adweek.com/aw/content_display/community/columns/other-columns/e3icaabfeb875c91a9eded38a30d7566be6&quot; title=&quot; The Real Digital Revolution&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;The Real Digital Revolution&amp;#8221;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In it, he asserts that the Real Digital Revolution is the mortal enemy of advertising and marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Because the real digital revolution is about consumer empowerment, the ability to research and learn about products and services and make decisions independently from, and in spite of, any sort of advertising messages.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I of course agree that advertising is at best part of an integrated approach, I see two things differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is about the first half of the assertion that the paradigm has shifted from:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Ad leads to purchase&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Ad leads to Google leads to purchase&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t think ads have led directly to purchases for a long time now. Good ads have always led to conversations. In the period that Advertising has had any purchase on it&amp;#8217;s own at all, good ads have led to conversations. They&amp;#8217;re noticeable, memorable and ideally shareable. The British benefited from only having four channels well into the era of modern advertising–because advertising was such a clear interruption of their limited programming, advertisers banked on engaging creative work that would turn into discussion over pints at the local.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second discrepancy is that it&amp;#8217;s not simply the proliferation of information and easy access to it that&amp;#8217;s making the difference. It&amp;#8217;s also the speed at which conversation now travels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we first learned that advertisers could conceivably be putting their bottom lines ahead of our needs, we&amp;#8217;ve turned to trusted sources to corroborate their messages or otherwise help us rationalize a purchase. That one friend who&amp;#8217;s a buff/fan, done the research, or somehow qualified to make a judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about it, who did you consult before you bought your last camera?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s changed isn&amp;#8217;t merely that the information can be googled, it&amp;#8217;s that we don&amp;#8217;t have to wait until we run into that friend to talk anymore. Sure I was grateful for the amazing camera research at &lt;a title=&quot;Digital Photography Review&quot; href=&quot;http://dpreview.com/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;dpreview&lt;/a&gt;. But then I called our friend &lt;a title=&quot;Michael Banasiak Photography&quot; href=&quot;http://camerawork.ca/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt;, the commercial photographer, for the low down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my mind, referals, and all the ways we can get them are the real digital revolution. And the lesson is that advertisers should focus on keeping the experts we turn to in the loop. This should in theory make their jobs easier in that there are fewer experts than info seekers.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Yardsale for a Brand</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/yardsale-for-a-brand/"/>
   <updated>2008-06-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/yardsale-for-a-brand</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-130 aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;picture-2&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/picture-2.png&quot; width=&quot;397&quot; height=&quot;139&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  I chose to participate in this year&amp;#8217;s Yard Sale for the Cure. A great concept. Get rid of your old junk and raise money for Breast Cancer. A &amp;#8220;win win&amp;#8221; as far as I can tell.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is not so for the organization behind the Yard Sale for the Cure. Who is the non-profit behind the Yard Sale for the Cure? I challenge you to figure it out. Go to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yardsaleforthecure.com&quot;&gt;web page&lt;/a&gt;, look at the printed materials, turn the baseball cap they send you inside out and upside down. You&amp;#8217;ll see Remax, the corporate sponsor. But, you won&amp;#8217;t find the name of the non-profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yard Sale for the Cure is very well branded. Bravo to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.griplimited.com/&quot;&gt;Grip Limited&lt;/a&gt; for providing powerful graphics and a comprehensive kit for participants to advertise their participation in this worthy event. Once you sign in on-line, you&amp;#8217;re mailed a sign for your lawn, a sign for your door, a baseball hat and all kinds of other goodies. Once you put the sign on your lawn that brands your home (and subsequently YOU) as affiliated with the cause, you feel good about yourself. Now my whole neighbourhood knows that I&amp;#8217;m the kind of person who would have a Yard Sale for the Cure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But,  none of those positive associations benefit CBCF. Yard Sale for the Cure is a tactic masquerading as a brand. It is the actual brand that loses out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a very credible organization behind the Yard Sale for the Cure. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbcf.org/&quot;&gt;The Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation.&lt;/a&gt; CBCF is national in scope and provides funding for research, education and advocacy. Imagine that I put a sign on my lawn that marked me as a CBCF supporter (via the Yard Sale for the Cure). Then the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cibcrunforthecure.com&quot;&gt;CIBC Run for the Cure&lt;/a&gt; rolls around (did you know that CBCF is behind this worthy event too?) I would be that much more likely to participate. I&amp;#8217;d be more likely to do everything CBCF because they gave me that &amp;#8220;feel good&amp;#8221; feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lesson? Sub brands work in the product world. We don&amp;#8217;t need to know that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.swiffer.com/&quot;&gt;Swiffer&lt;/a&gt; is a P&amp;amp;G product. But, in the competitive non-profit world, brands matter. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rethinkbreastcancer.com/&quot;&gt;Rethink Breast Cancer &lt;/a&gt;gets the marketing game. Their creative director comes from Zig. Rethink&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.naughtynautical.com/&quot;&gt;upcoming event&lt;/a&gt; is sub branded Naughty Nautical, but Rethink Breast Cancer remains front and center. They never give their name to a sponsor or fall off the radar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could you imagine Swiffer having a Clean Contest and forget to put it&amp;#8217;s name on the promotions? Unthinkable. I think it&amp;#8217;s time CBCF re-think it&amp;#8217;s branding strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Great way to sell a book–different/new/remarkable/relevant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Great execution–as good as any trailer should be and pays great respect to manga metaphor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The product itself looks noteworthy and relevant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Wish we did that&lt;a name=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>The Westjet experience</title>
   <link href="http://getpoole.comhttp://hypenotic.github.io/the-westjet-experience/"/>
   <updated>2008-05-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://getpoole.com/the-westjet-experience</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My loyalty to and likelihood of evangelizing for a given organization is directly proportional to the quality of the experience inherent in basic interactions with them. Stuff like waiting on the phone. Seth Godin says &amp;#8220;your brand is your return policy.&amp;#8221; In that your brand is what people think of you, I agree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Westjet must agree too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve never met their executives, engineers, mechanics or pilots. I don&amp;#8217;t recall their marketing materials. And in economy, planes are planes, the seats are cramped and the the food isn&amp;#8217;t. I&amp;#8217;ve only really ever interacted with one of their customer touchpoints–their flight attendants. But the experience has been so consistently memorable that I now realize it&amp;#8217;s a business strategy. Someone clued in to the fact that air-travel is imperfect, and the only influence they had over the experience was attitude. Theirs is swell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they look twice as good because Air Canada sucks. With enemies like AC, who needs friends?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bet they&amp;#8217;d be happy to know how my family and I feel about traveling with them. I bet they&amp;#8217;d be happier to hear how many people I&amp;#8217;ve told and how many of them agreed with me about the Westjet expereince. And I bet they&amp;#8217;d never admit it, but I&amp;#8217;m sure that deep down they&amp;#8217;d be happy to hear how many of the people I&amp;#8217;ve discussed this with agreed with me about the Air Canada experience.&lt;/p&gt;
