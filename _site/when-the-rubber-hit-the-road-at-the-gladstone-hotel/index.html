</p>

<p>I was working at the <a href="http://www.gladstonehotel.com/hotel">Gladstone Hotel </a>café on Tuesday, when an older, slightly disheveled man walked in with an elastic band around his head. When the waitress kindly asked him the reason for the elastic band (it was clear they knew each other) he replied it was there to keep his &#8220;thoughts together.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aside from the obvious humor of the moment, I gradually realized that the man was clearly dealing with mental illness. Even though some of his behaviour was quite strange and distracting, the waitress poured him a (free) cup of coffee and invited him to sit and stay at the bar for a while.</p>

<p>The Gladstone Hotel is different than <a href="http://www.thedrakehotel.ca/">the other boutique hotel down the street </a>because the Gladstone has a social mission. As they say on their website (which Hypenotic designed by the way):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>More than a hotel,The Gladstone is a social and cultural incubator facilitating sustainable and accessible ways of experiencing art, culture, community, and local cuisine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what I call a &#8220;rubber hits the road&#8221; moment and I was proud to be a patron at the Gladstone&#8217;s café. Yes, some of the man&#8217;s behaviours made me uncomfortable, but I was happy to get past my own discomfort and have him be a patron at the café with me.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s face it, the prospect of causing discomfort would have caused many other places to briskly whisk the man out. And, the idea of discomfort, our own or others&#8217;, often governs our decisions. It&#8217;s not wrong to consider how decisions like these will impact those who are connect to our business. But what happens when you compromise your values, and those of your business, to avoid discomfort or inconvenience?</p>

<p>It got me thinking about other &#8220;rubber hits the road&#8221; moments and whether we take the opportunity to live our values even when that decision is uncomfortable for us or our clients, partners, etc. Here are some questions I started thinking about when contemplating this issue:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Would I  donate to the good causes I support even if it was a slow year for business?</li>
<li>  Would I hire an employee if doing so required me to invest in expensive accommodations to make the workplace accessible?</li>
<li>  On a smaller level, would I buy <a href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8653/is-this-really-the-way-to-do-business">the more expensive recycled printer paper</a> at Staples, even though no one would ever know the difference?</li>
<li>  Would I turn down lucrative work that I felt compromised my company&#8217;s values, even though the &#8216;compromise&#8217; may not seem obvious to employees or the outside world?</li>
</ul>

<p>These aren&#8217;t easy questions, or easy moments. Other than our good guts, the other measure we use is our <a href="http://www.bcorporation.net/hypenotic">B Corp Certification</a> which actually ensures we keep tabs on the  impact our business has on the environment, the community and our employees. We also know lots of ethical people we can consult in sticky situations. We&#8217;re far from perfect. But I&#8217;m comforted knowing we&#8217;re on a path.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m wondering about your &#8220;rubber hits the road&#8221; moments and what tools or resources you use to navigate through &#8220;rubber hits the road&#8221; decisions? Is it religion, a saying or a book? I&#8217;d love to hear it.</p>
