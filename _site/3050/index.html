  <h1 class="post-title">Vivian &#038; Bourdain: A Case Study in Leadership</h1>
  <span class="post-date">01 Oct 2010</span>
  <span class="post-author"></span>
  <p><a rel="attachment wp-att-3053" href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/3050/3050/attachment/screen-shot-2010-10-01-at-2-04-20-pm"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3053" title="Screen shot 2010-10-01 at 2.04.20 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-01-at-2.04.20-PM.png" alt="" width="244" height="280" /></a>Heard a great story from <a href="http://www.thebeastrestaurant.com/">Beast </a>Restaurant chef + friend <a href="http://www.chefdb.com/nm/11289/">Scott Vivian</a> at <a href="http://www.thedrakehotel.ca/culture/86d">The Drake&#8217;s 86&#8242;d</a> Monday night (see? inspiration is everywhere&#8211;see <a href="http://hypenotic.com/blog/2820/how-to-be-a-prolific-blogger">this post</a> for a reminder).</p>

<p>Vivian&#8217;s tale of meeting Anthony Bourdain highlighted  the importance of being a leader and the benefits that one derives from not just &#8220;sell, sell, sell-ing&#8221; yourself + what you offer.</p>

<p>So, here goes. Beast was invited to cater the <a href="http://www.anthonybourdain.net/">Anthony Bourdain</a> after-party following Bourdain&#8217;s appearance at <a href="http://www.masseyhall.com/">Massey Hall. </a>Vivian was also asked to bring Bourdain a meal to his green room.</p>

<p>Now, lots of people love Anthony Bourdain. And lots of people would like bragging rights to say they hung out with Bourdain, or even better, got featured on his TV show <a href="http://www.travelchannel.com/TV_Shows/Anthony_Bourdain">No Reservations. </a></p>

<p>In fact, as Vivian describes it, people who were lined up to have their copies of Bourdains latest book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Medium-Raw-Bloody-Valentine-People/dp/0061718947">Medium Raw</a></em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Medium-Raw-Bloody-Valentine-People/dp/0061718947"> </a>signed were shouting out requests like &#8220;Hey Anthony, wanna go for dinner?&#8221; &#8220;Hey Anthony come to my restaurant.&#8221; One fella even walked through the crowd just to give Bourdain a draft (draft??) beer, which he accepted and gracefully set aside.</p>

<p>Before the show, when Vivian went backstage to deliver Bourdain his meal, the fellow chef welcomed Vivian in for a beer, and the two got to talking. Ya know. Chit chat.</p>

<p>Eventually, the conversation turned to Bourdain&#8217;s show, and Vivian asked why No Reservations had never filmed in Toronto. Bourdain replied that he&#8217;d spent some time in Canada&#8211;in Vancouver and Montreal, and that chefs in those towns slagged Toronto and its food-scene so badly, that Bourdain didn&#8217;t think Toronto had much to offer.</p>

<p>Vivian took the opportunity to tell Bourdain about Toronto&#8217;s food community&#8211;the young chefs who often work together to put together incredible events and who give unprecedented profile and vitality to our food culture. He also told Bourdain about the range of ethic foods available on the cheap all throughout Toronto&#8217;s neighbourhoods.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Vivian finally said, (and I paraphrase): &#8220;Listen, come to Toronto. And don&#8217;t come to my restaurant, let me show you around. I&#8217;ll take you to my favourite hidden spots  and you&#8217;ll see how great Toronto is.&#8221; To that Bourdain simply replied &#8220;I&#8217;m going to bring No Reservations to Toronto, and we&#8217;ll make TV together.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only did Bourdain make that offer to Vivian, but he repeated it again in front of a large group of people during the book signing. In addition, Bourdain made a point of praising Vivian and Beast from the stage in front of um, about 3000 foodies. Beast&#8217;s phone has been ringing ever since.</p>

<p>The  now-famous exchange between chefs has been covered in numerous publications including <a href="http://www.torontolife.com/daily/daily-dish/aprons-icons/2010/09/24/despite-some-reservations-toronto-will-appear-on-anthony-bourdain%E2%80%99s-no-reservations/">Toronto Life</a> and has been a hot topic in the foodie community. But, what&#8217;s most impressive to me is not that Vivian had the chance to talk to Bourdain mano-a-mano. Or even that Bourdain wants to &#8220;make TV&#8221; (sound sexy when you say it like that) with Vivian.</p>

<p>What blows my mind is how intuitively Vivian knows how to be a leader. And how that is what will ultimately bring No Reservations to Toronto.</p>

<p>Even before Bourdain came to town, Vivian was interviewed about the <a href="http://www.postcity.com/Cityscape/restoronto/September-2010/Where-Beast-039s-Scott-Vivian-would-take-Anthony-Bourdain-in-TO/">top five Toronto restaurants</a> he&#8217;d take Bourdain if given the chance. Look at the list. Notice anything interesting? Beast is nowhere on the list. Why? Because Vivian&#8217;s a classy dude, and because Vivian is a true leader in Toronto&#8217;s food movement.</p>

<p>The take away from this exchange should be clear; Don&#8217;t make it about you and you&#8217;ll succeed. Now, the &#8216;it&#8217; in this sentence refers to any kind of communication activity; a tweet, a facebook post, a blog, an interview, a print ad&#8211;a job interview, a cocktail conversation for god sakes.</p>

<p>Sales culture, like the kind featured in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104348/">Glengarry Glen Ross</a> still informs the way we approach how we do business (wow, I forgot how good this movie is.) Got leads? Sell them. Close them. A.B.C &#8220;Always. Be. Closing.&#8221;  Even though we work in open concept loft spaces, we still act like we work in boiler rooms like the ones in the movie. Why? Because we want instant results. And we don&#8217;t trust that another way works.</p>

<p>But the truth is talking about yourself, selling yourself, pushing, pushing, pushing your wares is not what it takes to attract a following. We talk alot about communities, tribes, communities of interest. But do we really act as though we know what that means? As <a href="http://www.chrisbrogan.com/audience-or-community/">Chris Brogan rightfully says</a>, &#8220;The difference between an audience and a community is which direction the chairs are pointing.&#8221;</p>

<p>But, what does it really take to build community?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It takes confidence not to be so obsessed with ROI that you can&#8217;t let go and give power to the community</p></li>
<li><p>It takes being a good listener and caring about what other people have to say and give them props when they deserve them</p></li>
<li><p>It takes an ego check. No, this isn&#8217;t about you. Are you sure you can handle it?</p></li>
<li><p>It takes understanding how these various tools work and the right way to use them to attract and retain the interest of communities</p></li>
</ol>

<p>What else does it take? You to tell me.</p>
