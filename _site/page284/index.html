        3 Ways To Avoid &#8220;Doing The Hustle&#8221;
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">31 Aug 2011</span>

    <p><a href="http://hypenotic.com/fun-stuff/6630/3-ways-to-avoid-doing-the-hustle/attachment/screen-shot-2011-08-30-at-10-53-21-am-3" rel="attachment wp-att-6634"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6634" title="Screen shot 2011-08-30 at 10.53.21 AM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Screen-shot-2011-08-30-at-10.53.21-AM2.png" alt="" width="464" height="183" /></a>On our first day back from a glorious three week vacation,  I turned to Barry (my husband and co-worker) and told him we had to <em>&#8220;hustle&#8221;</em> and  get refocused on work. A firm believer in slow principles and a generally annoying optimist he rolled his eyes.  Together we started contemplating the connection between the two meanings of hustle.</p>

<p><em>Hustle:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>  To seriously move your ass to be as productive as possible</li>
<li>  To act in an exploitive manner to get what you want–at all costs. To steal from others to benefit yourself.</li>
</ul>

<p>The second, less ethical definition was actually the first to exist.</p>

<p>As early as 1680 the Dutch used the word &#8220;<em>hutselen&#8221;  </em>to mean &#8220;to shake to and fro&#8221; derived from a game translated into hustle cap where coins were aggressively shaken in a cap.</p>

<p>Something about the pushing and jostling sense of the word became associated with shoving anyone and anything out of the way to get ahead by any means possible. A Machiavellian approach to getting ahead where the &#8220;ends justify the means.&#8221; Centuries later this version of the term has been glorified in hip hop culture with the hustler as a kind of urban hero. <a href="http://www.50cent.com/#!all">Think 50 Cent.</a></p>

<p>Hustle&#8217;s association with productivity didn&#8217;t emerge until the late 1800&#8242;s when Abraham Lincoln was credited with saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Things may come to those who wait. But only the things left by those who hustle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And Thomas Edison is credited with saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everything comes to him who hustles while he waits</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Turns out that waiting and hustling are mortal enemies.</p>

<p>But consider this; hustling in Lincoln and Edison&#8217;s sense of the word is a kind of an exploitive thief as well. <a href="http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/miic-mmac/chap_4-eng.php">Research shows</a> that 12% of Canadians will experience anxiety. It&#8217;s no wonder really. Consider how hard we push ourselves to use up every moment of our time to be bigger, better, more. At the end of a long day we end up literally feeling like we&#8217;ve been &#8220;shaken to and fro.&#8221; Those two definitions aren&#8217;t so far apart after all.</p>

<p>Carrie Fisher makes reference to this reality when she said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Instant gratification takes too long</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So post-vacation and during the back to school season I want to share some great resources to help focus your attention on how to be productive without letting the hustle steal your life. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;m working on right alongside you:</p>

<ul>
<li>  <a href="http://zenhabits.net/start/">Zen Habits</a>: Leo Baubata is a web luminary on the subject of living simpler while being more productive. He&#8217;s done it himself to great success. His blog post <a href="http://zenhabits.net/no-hurry/">How Not to Hurry</a> based on the Taoist premise &#8220;if nature can get everything done without rushing, so can you.&#8221; Baubata admits its not easy, but the key is taking responsibility for your life.  Again, it&#8217;s not about achieving less. It&#8217;s about achieving what you want with less pain and strife.</li>
<li>  <a href="http://www.theprofessionalhobo.com/about/">Professional Hobo:</a> If you wish to live vicariously through someone who made the choice to step off the grid, this is the blogger for you. Nora Dunn was a financial planning expert in Toronto until 2007 when she sold off everything she had and hit the road. Why? As she says &#8221; &#8216;Life Happens When You&#8217;re Busy Making Plans.&#8217; I realized this was happening to me and I didn&#8217;t like it so much&#8221;</li>
<li>  Watch <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/carl_honore_praises_slowness.html">Carl Honoré&#8217;s TED Talk on Slowness</a> focused on our need for speed (living the fast life instead of the good life) and what&#8217;s to be gained by slowing down in terms of health, work, relationships, etc. He&#8217;s committed to The Slow Movement and stop living on a stop watch.</li>
