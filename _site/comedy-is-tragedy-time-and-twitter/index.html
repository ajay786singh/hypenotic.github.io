  <h1 class="post-title">Comedy is Tragedy + Time&#8230;. and Twitter</h1>
  <span class="post-date">01 Feb 2011</span>
  <span class="post-author"></span>
  <p>I did it. Last night I got up on stage and read at <a href="http://www.grownupsreadthingstheywroteaskids.com/">Grownups Read Things they Wrote as Kids</a>. I read some poetry I wrote in grade nine about a boy, love, drugs, zits&#8211;you name it. Yes, in a narcissistic way, I just want to share it with you because I did something that was a bit outside my comfort zone and I like that.</p>

<p>But, I also want to reflect on the question you might be asking yourself &#8220;why (the hell) did I want to read something I wrote in grade 9?&#8221;</p>

<p>In fact, I want reflect on why the 11 other people who read last night jumped on stage to read stuff. On a bigger scale, I want to consider why Dan Misener&#8217;s project has been so successful that last night was the 10th anniversary of the event.&lt;!--more--&gt;</p>

<p>I think there&#8217;s a clue to all of this in Dan&#8217;s own description of how the whole thing got started. Apparently he was at his girlfriend&#8217;s house for Christmas when the two stumbled on her old diary. They spent the day reading out loud to one another and discovered:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>`This is really funny, reading this stuff out loud to each other. I bet other people are in the exact same boat. I bet a lot of other people have this kind of stuff lying around. And wouldn&#8217;t it be fun to get together with a bunch of them and do exactly this?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I was searching for the right stuff to read, I didn&#8217;t think the poems I selected were funny at all. In fact, I thought they were tragic. When I was listening to other people&#8217;s readings, I thought, &#8220;theirs are funny, but mine&#8217;s not funny.&#8221; But, it turns out my poems were funny too.  As you watch the video, pay attention to where the laughter erupts. It&#8217;s worth noting.</p>

<p>The question around why people like to share stuff like this is not unlike understanding the psychology of using social media platforms like Twitter.</p>

<p>Some pop-psychology writers like those who are published in <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-tao-innovation/200903/understanding-the-psychology-twitter">Psychology Today</a> have theorized that it&#8217;s all about our need to connect with community. A community that has become more and more inaccessible since the Industrial Revolution.</p>

<p>Others like <a href="http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/the_way_we_live/article5747308.ece">David Lewis</a>, a cognitive psychologist in the UK, claim that it&#8217;s all about existentialism:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Using Twitter suggests a level of insecurity whereby, unless people recognize you, you cease to exist. It may stave off insecurity in the short term, but it won&#8217;t cure it.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I reflect on the experience of sharing something awkward and painful, I&#8217;m reminded of some of my more painful Tweets. I can remember the hellish parenting moment I was having when I Tweeted,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;These kids could lead a person to Nicorette.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The tragedy of my parenting situation only became funny when I said it out loud&#8211;mostly to strangers out there in the Twitter-verse.</p>

<p>At their best, narcissistic Tweets aren&#8217;t much different than reading grade 9 poetry to an audience of grownups. Twitter provides a reflective distance that allows one to step outside of a given moment and therefore have a different reaction to one&#8217;s circumstances. Maybe that&#8217;s one reason why Twitter&#8217;s <a href="http://www.marketingcharts.com/interactive/tech-savvy-moms-increase-social-media-use-by-462-9699/">so big among the mommy crowd.</a></p>

<p>After all, as the queen of comedy Carole Burnett once said, &#8220;Comedy is tragedy plus time.&#8221; To that I would add, &#8220;Comedy is Tragedy plus Twitter.&#8221;</p>
