  <h1 class="post-title">What Arbonne Tells Us About the World of Work</h1>
  <span class="post-date">04 May 2013</span>
  <span class="post-author"></span>
  <p>About two years ago this new word<em><a href="https://arbonne.com"> &#8220;Arbonne&#8221;</a> </em>began entering my lexicon. First I heard it occasionally. Now it&#8217;s infiltrated my Facebook page and my social life to the point where it&#8217;s got my full attention.</p>

<p>I came home from an evening enjoying wine and warm weather on the back porch of my neighbour&#8217;s house with a three day trial of Arbonne product. I&#8217;m a cynic, but I figured if so many women are so pumped up about launching direct sales of cream and cosmetics I needed to know more. Three days later, my skin&#8217;s about the same but my thoughts on this phenomenon are certainly clearer.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s start with the basic premise that a natural cream or cleanser will transform your skin or your appearance so dramatically that people will stop you on the street. I managed to willingly suspend my belief during the three day trial, but when my forehead wrinkles persisted I shook my head and reminded myself that if it sounds too good to be true, your forehead will still be wrinkly tomorrow.</p>

<p>But the promise of Arbonne is not really about car-stopping, glowing skin. It&#8217;s that by selling Arbonne, and moving up the ladder of success, this product can change your life. Leafing through the catalogue as the serum sunk into my forehead I read the same story highlighted by almost every beautiful Arbonne Independent Consultant featured in the catalogue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to the catalogue, the women who sell Arbonne are hard working women who bought into the corporate dream only to realize that the stakes were too high. They wanted to be there for their kids and husbands and Arbonne gave them the lifestyles they need to do just that.</p>
</blockquote>

</p>

<p>What does it say that women like the one featured above have become CPAs, Lawyers and Corporate success stories, only to realize that selling cosmetics (much like their mothers who may have sold Avon or Mary Kay) gives them the balance they need.</p>

<p>This week <a href="http://www.law.utoronto.ca/admissions/why-u-t/welcome-university-toronto-faculty-law">Dean Mayo Moran, </a>U of T Law School&#8217;s first female Dean and one of the recipients of this year&#8217;s <a href="https://www.ywcatoronto.org/page.asp?pid=59">YWCA Toronto&#8217;s Women of Distinction Awards</a> <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/metromorning/">spoke on CBC</a> about how law firms are needing to adapt to meet the needs of women who are leaving the profession in droves.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://umanitoba.ca/news/blogs/blog/2013/03/04/businesses-and-workers-both-benefit-from-flexible-schedules/">recent University of Manitoba survey</a> found that both women and men report greater happiness when they have the flexibility to attend appointments and look after their kids&#8217; needs. Is it really a revelation that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Parents who work flexible hours are more likely to be satisfied with their work-family balance”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Arbonne&#8217;s success among successful women deserves all the attention it gets, but not because we all need some <a href="https://arbonne.com/shop_online/showitem.asp?ProductId=813">Re9 Intensive Renewal Serum</a> to combat the wrinkles forming on our foreheads. The growth of Arbonne, while quite retro in some ways, says a lot about the modern workplace context:</p>

<ol>
<li> <span style="line-height: 12.997159004211426px;">The modern workplace&#8217;s inability to adapt to the needs of the dual income family is making people unhappy</span></li>
<li> Arbonne is disintermediating the world of work just like kickstarter is disintermediating the world of charity and skype is disintermediating the world of long distance</li>
<li> Women, who are on average lower income earners are flocking to Arbonne because Arbonne is the right thing at the right time (non-evil natural products and a promise of giving women the chance to have the flexibility they need)</li>
</ol>

<p>As Yahoo and Best Buy put out the call for &#8220;all hands on deck&#8221; signalling a death knoll for flexibile work arrangements that take families and the increasing need for dual incomes into account, Arbonne is flourishing because its giving families what they need.</p>

<p>Yeah its just the Avon lady reinvented, but this time its not about giving mom a little &#8220;pocket change&#8221; to go to the mall, it&#8217;s about the promise of the white Mercedes to drive the kids to school without all the corporate junk in the trunk.</p>
