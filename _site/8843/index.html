  <p>I&#8217;m getting more and more questions about BCorp.<br>
Instead of answering the basics through email, I thought I&#8217;d post a bit about why we&#8217;re certified and invite you to an event that&#8217;s happening this week where you can learn more about it.</p>

<p>Maybe the best way to start is to answer why Hypenotic became a BCorp.</p>

<p>Yes, I realize we don&#8217;t have legislation to support our commitment to running a purpose driven business in Ontario. Yet. My hope is that when enough corporations make the symbolic commitment, it will put pressure on lawmakers to create provisions for us. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re putting in extra effort to help BCorp grow.</p>

<p>Until then, the certification offers several direct benefits:</p>

<ol>
<li> We were doing business ethically already, so it&#8217;s nice to be recognized for it. We love gold stars.</li>
<li> As it turns out, we&#8217;re not perfect, and our scorecard gives us insight into where we can improve.</li>
<li> There are now over 500 BCorps in Canada and the US, 7 states that recognize it and 5 more in the pipeline. We&#8217;d prefer to both get business from and give business to these kinds of enterprises.</li>
</ol>

<p>Certification also has several indirect benefits:</p>

<ol>
<li> We&#8217;ve already received work from the kind of clients we like in part due to our certification.</li>
<li> This morning I presented to a dream arts/community based client after making it to the second round of proposals. They cited two reasons for inviting us: A previous project they like, and upon digging into us, our Bcorp certification.</li>
</ol>

<p>I see many indications that unsustainable business practices are being recognized for what they are, including a financial crisis dominoing across Europe and the US&#8217; housing collapse in 2007/8. I truly believe that businesses will increasingly require proof at minimum of ethical practices, but more likely evidence that how they make their margins actually brings value to others as well.</p>

<p>We were already observing many of the certification tenets, but this year we&#8217;re putting one person in charge of shepherding us to better grades. We can only improve in some areas, but we like the idea of a roadmap, so we&#8217;re glad to have them.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re incorporated (big or small), and would like to meet corporate leaders of purpose driven businesses, then we&#8217;ve got a party for you. It&#8217;s Happening Wednesday at fellow Bcorp Patagonia&#8217;s swell space down the street on King West and is co-hosted by Bcorp and The Natural Step Canada. We&#8217;re each supposed to bring a prospective Bcorp. Will you come?</p>
