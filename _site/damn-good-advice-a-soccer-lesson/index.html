  <p>While watching soccer with my grandfather when I was a child, he would say to me, “The ball is round, anything could happen”. This advice has stuck with me.</p>

<p>I personally cannot apply this advice to the game of soccer, mostly because I’m not a soccer player, and I say this with confidence. During one of my first house league soccer games as a child, another boy ran up to me and kicked my in my shins. I fled the field crying and haven’t returned since. Though my chances of becoming a professional soccer player were slim to none, I had already started to pave my own path. One that involved a piece of paper and a pencil.</p>

<p>Here I found that anything really could happen, and it was easy on the shins. As a child the possibilities for creating were limitless, there were no boundaries that needed to be broken, and any idea seemed to be a good one. I was reminded of the importance of having an open mind while flipping through the pages of <a href="http://www.presentationzen.com/">“Presentation Zen”</a> by Garr Reynolds,</p>

<p>“A child does not know what is possible and so is open to exploration, discovery, and experimentation. If you approach creative tasks with the <a href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9389/9389">beginners mind,</a> you can see things more clearly as they are”.</p>

<p>Working at Hypenotic as an illustrator and designer for the past couple months has been a huge learning experience, and although a may not directly apply my grandfathers advice to the work that I do, it is always in the back of my mind.</p>

<p>Creating an info-graphic or an illustration is all about finding a solution for a given problem. Many illustrators, including myself, can easily get stuck up on the first solution that comes into mind, and although you may hit the nail on the head the first time, 9 times out of 10 you won’t. Most of the time, nailing the solution means thinking of all the possibilities then weeding out the worst ones until your left with something that really works. I’ve learned that when you do finally come up the solution, no matter how much planning you do for a project, things are going to change somewhere along the road.</p>

<p>In short, anything is possible so explore those possibilities, and be prepared for anything to happen along the way, because it will.</p>
