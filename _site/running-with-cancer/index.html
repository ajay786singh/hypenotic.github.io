  <p>In April my friend Leanne Coppen died of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HER2/neu">Her2</a> breast cancer.</p>

<p>She was only 38 and had been diagnosed only 2 years earlier. She did the 60K <a href="http://www.endcancer.ca/">Weekend to End Women&#8217;s Cancers</a> after her cancer had metastasized.  That&#8217;s a long way for anyone to walk. But for someone who had been through over a year of treatment, it&#8217;s downright incredible.  Here&#8217;s a short video of Leanne&#8217;s walk last year that was part of the orientation materials <a href="http://to10.endcancer.ca/site/PageServer?pagename=10_aboutevent">Princess Margaret</a> makes available online:</p>

<p>Now, let&#8217;s put all that sad stuff behind us for a moment.</p>

<p>Leanne was an amazing writer who blogged about Living with Breast Cancer for <a href="http://en.chatelaine.com/english/index.jsp">Chatelaine magazine</a>. I was recently reading her blog posts and stumbled upon a post where she wrote about going for a run in the midst of her treatment cycle. If you want to be blown away by a woman you never had the pleasure of meeting <a href="http://blog.en.chatelaine.com/living-with-http://blog.en.chatelaine.com/living-with-breast-cancer/when-she-says-10-minutes-she-means-it/">read the post here.</a></p>

<p>She was the ideal poster child for my upcoming Walk to End Women&#8217; Cancers. Because I&#8217;m a big wimp, I&#8217;ll only be walking 32K in one day, not the 60K she walked over the course of a weekend last year. If it wasn&#8217;t for her, I wouldn&#8217;t be walking at all, I&#8217;d be sitting on my couch <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jodilastman">Tweeting </a>or <a href="http://www.laineygossip.com/">something. </a></p>

<p>When I first started talking to people about doing the walk I envisioned I would start walking and then not stop for like a really, really long time. Kinda like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109830/">Forest Gump</a>. Then people started asking, &#8220;are you training?&#8221; and warning &#8220;that&#8217;s a long walk you know.&#8221; The kind people at work even mapped it and then told me that it was like walking to York Mills and back downtown.</p>

<p>At first I was taken aback. I signed up for a class at the <a href="http://www.runningroom.com/hm/">Running Room</a>, bought new shoes, and a <a href="http://www.runningroom.com/hm/inside.php?id=2584">book on walking</a>. I&#8217;ve been trying to walk regularly as I head towards the big day on September 11th.</p>

<p>But more than anything that damn blog post has kept me motivated. How could a woman who had endured rounds upon rounds of gruelling cancer treatment walk 60K and train while neck deep in shit? Well she did. And frankly she did it with a smile. And so healthy, lucky me is totally confident that I can do a measly 32K with a smile firmly planted on my face too.</p>

<p>And, if you can&#8217;t walk, I&#8217;m pretty confident you can donate. I know that&#8217;s pushy. But hell, I&#8217;m going to be pushy about this one.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve received letters about The Weekend before and frankly ignored them. But now I know better. And so do you.</p>
