  <span class="post-date">27 Oct 2011</span>
  <span class="post-author"></span>
  <p>I don&#8217;t want to be* that person;  *That person who picks on the most obvious multinational for being greedy. That person who picks on moms who are entitled to their own values and just want to make a buck. So, I&#8217;m going to try my hardest not to be that person.</p>

<p>You may be familiar with an initiative called <a href="http://allaccessmoms.cityline.ca/mcdonalds-all-access-moms/">McDonald&#8217;s All-Access Moms</a>, a partnership between <a href="http://www.citytv.com/cityline" target="_blank">Cityline</a>, McDonalds and three Canadian &#8220;Mom bloggers&#8221; who won the chance to get a behind-the scenes look at McDonalds&#8217; business practices. Here&#8217;s what it says on the site:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Selected as representatives of busy Canadian moms who eat on-the-go with their families and are curious to know how McDonald’s food is made and where it actually comes from, the three McDonald’s All-Access Moms will travel across the country armed with tough questions and a network of parents behind them looking forward to learning about their journey.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So far the group has gone on three McDonald&#8217;s excursions:</p>

<ul>
<li>  A trip to Chicago to meet &#8220;Chef Dan&#8221; who creates all of McD&#8217;s recipes</li>
<li>  A potato farm in New Brunswick (where McD&#8217;s french fries come from)</li>
<li>  Cargill, a cattle farm in Alberta (where McD&#8217;s beef comes from and one of the world&#8217;s largest agribusiness players)</li>
</ul>

<p>The &#8220;All Access Tour&#8221; is hosted b<a href="http://allaccessmoms.cityline.ca/about-nanny-robina/">y Nanny Robina, </a>a Cityline parenting expert, and airs on Cityline. The findings from the tour are also featured on the McD&#8217;s hosted All Access site. The mom bloggers also post about their McD adventures on their Twitter, facebook and blogs, sharing their findings with their mom communities.</p>

<p>I won&#8217;t provide you with a listing of some of the insights the mommy bloggers have gleaned from the tour so far&#8211;I&#8217;ll let you read the blogs and tweets for yourself on the <a href="http://allaccessmoms.cityline.ca/all-access-moms-blog/">All Access Blog</a> (I will admit I&#8217;m using all my powers of self control here).</p>

<p>But, let me just point out that the &#8220;All Access Tour&#8221; is built on a foundation of false transparency. The idea is &#8220;we&#8217;ll pull back the veil and give you a no holds barred view of McDonald&#8217;s&#8221;,  but of course there&#8217;s nothing transparent about it. Yes, the some of the food comes from farms but that doesn&#8217;t make it good.  The truth is that what McDonald&#8217;s calls Grilled Chicken is actually this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Boneless chicken breast meat, water, seasoning (salt, potassium chloride, trehalose, sugar, rice starch, hydrolyzed corn protein, flavour (autolyzed yeast extract, salt, disodium inosinate and disodium guanylate), spices, dextrose, garlic powder, autolyzed yeast extract, carrageenan, chicken fat, dehydrated cooked chicken powder, silicon dioxide, caramel, onion powder, corn maltodextrin), modified rice starch, sodium phosphates. Cooked on a grill lightly seasoned with trans fat free cooking spray (Canola oil, water, salt, hydrogenated cottonseed oil, soy lecithin, monoglycerides, potassium sorbate, artificial flavour and colour (annatto, turmeric), citric acid, vitamin A, vitamin D3</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that&#8217;s just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>But not one of the All Access Moms will tell you this. This is because the deal between Cityline, McDonald&#8217;s and Mommy bloggers is of course a <em>business</em> arrangement. As one Toronto Star article featuring All Access mommy blogger Maureen Dennis (who in the interests of full transparency I know and have worked with) puts it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maureen Dennis, founder of seven-year-old Wee Welcome says it’s a matter of business. She has built a network of 40,000 members and has four staff to pay. Yet she’s frequently asked to share her insights and access for nothing, or in exchange for products. “I can’t pay my phone bill with free stuff.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because this is a business relationship it cannot be considered free from business interests. There are terms to this employment relationship and those terms render the term &#8220;All Access&#8221; meaningless.</p>

<p>So what is to be done?</p>

<p>Can we blame Mommy bloggers for paying their bills&#8211;even in an unscrupulous manner?  If their networks don&#8217;t like how they behave, they can show their distain by leaving the community or making their opinions known. Can we blame McDonald&#8217;s for being greedy and wanting to clean up their image, even in a way I think is repulsive? I wouldn&#8217;t expect much more.  Can we blame Cityline for&#8230;.??</p>

<p>After much consideration I actually believe that Cityline is the most culpable party in this whole arrangement. Cityline is complicit in creating a false sense of transparency&#8211;the illusion of reality to that gives McDonald&#8217;s promise &#8220;All Access&#8221; the edge it needs. After all, Cityline is a trusted media program with a responsibility to be an honest broker of information.</p>

<p>Cityline is a key partner in the &#8220;All Access&#8221; triumvirate&#8221;  because they  lend an air of  &#8220;journalistic&#8221; credibility to the entire endeavour. I find this shameful and beyond reproach.</p>

<p>What do you think about &#8220;All Access Moms?&#8221; If you were to write a petition or go after someone on a platform like<a href="http://www.change.org/"> Change.org</a> how would you  position the issue to direct action at the right party in all of this?</p>

<p>I&#8217;d really appreciate your input on this because I&#8217;d like to do something. I&#8217;m just not sure what&#8230;.yet.</p>
