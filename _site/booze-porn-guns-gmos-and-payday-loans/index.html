        <p class="meta"><span class="sub-meta">By</span>  <span class="sub-meta">in</span> category</p>
        <p>When I was completing the most recent version of the <a href="http://www.bcorporation.net/become/BRS">B Corp Assessmen</a>t today, this set of questions caught my attention. Anything jump out at you?</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9552/booze-porn-guns-gmos-and-payday-loans/attachment/screen-shot-2012-07-16-at-12-51-47-pm-3" rel="attachment wp-att-9558"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9558" title="Screen shot 2012-07-16 at 12.51.47 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Screen-shot-2012-07-16-at-12.51.47-PM2.png" alt="" width="604" height="232" /></a>
</p>

<p>I find it fascinating that Payday Loans are sandwiched between GMOs and porn on this list.</p>

<p>Not sure what they are? In short, payday loans are short term, unsecured loans that are to be paid on, you got it, payday.</p>

<p>So what makes them so bad?</p>

<p>I set out on a journey to dig deeper. I admit, I&#8217;ve been increasingly curious about payday loans as I&#8217;ve watched them multiply like weeds in the downtown core. So, why is<a href="http://www.mrpayday.ca/"> Mr. Payday</a> considered Mr. Monsanto&#8217;s next door neighbour? Here&#8217;s what you need to know.</p>

<p><strong>Why Payday Loans?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>  Payday loans target the working poor whose needs are largely ignored by Canada&#8217;s mainstream financial institutions</li>
<li>  For those without credit payday loans may be the only safety net in times of financial need or crisis</li>
<li>  Poor people are disproportionately subject to judgments and garnishments that make it preferable to operate in cash</li>
<li>  Payday loan outlets tend to have convenient hours and super friendly service. And the whole transaction takes about 15 mins no questions asked.</li>
</ul>

<div>
  <strong>So, What&#8217;s the Problem?</strong>
</div>

<ul>
<li>  In Canada, the average payday loan has an interest rate of 350-600% APR (Annual Percentage Rate). By contrast, a gold Visa card has a 9.9% APR interest rate</li>
<li>  According to a research report by the <a href="http://www.responsiblelending.org/payday-lending/research-analysis/phantom-demand-short-term-due-date-generates-need-for-repeat-payday-loans-accounting-for-76-of-total-volume.html">Centre for Responsible Lending</a> (CRL) &#8220;A full three quarters of loan volume of the payday lending industry is generated by borrowers who, after meeting the short-term due date of the loan, must re-borrow before their next pay period&#8221; In other words, its not the first loan that&#8217;s the problem, it&#8217;s the loan on the loan on the loan.</li>
<li>  This inability to pay is what&#8217;s called a &#8220;rollover.&#8221; As CRL found rolling over loans accounts for 76 percent of total loan volume in Canada</li>
<li>  A US <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1120556">study of payday loan customers</a> found that &#8220;about 20% had rolled over 9 or more advances.&#8221;</li>
<li>  In 29 of the 35 US states that permit this kind of lending, payday loan storefronts outnumber McDonalds&#8217; restaurants (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/13/opinion/13mon3.html?_r=2">NTY, 2009</a>)</li>
</ul>

<div>
  <strong>So, What&#8217;s the Solution?</strong>
</div>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Of course, ensuring a living wage for people is the best way to reduce the seduction of the payday loan. The Stop&#8217;s <a href="http://putfoodinthebudget.ca/">Put Food in the Budget </a>shows how far Toronto&#8217;s poor need to stretch their dollars just to manage their basic needs each month. And if an emergency comes up, you&#8217;re shit out of luck.
    </li>
    <li>
      Currently Canadian law doesn&#8217;t allow for peer to peer lending like <a href="http://www.prosper.com/">Prosper</a> in the US. Canada&#8217;s <a href="http://www.communitylend.com/">Community Lend</a> (who we worked with when they were just starting out) is, as you can see &#8220;no longer accepting applicants.&#8221; That&#8217;s because (and they put it nicely) &#8220;P2P Lending, as it needs to operate within the Canadian regulatory system today, has enough headwinds blowing against it that getting to a significant scale was going to be both expensive and difficult.&#8221; That&#8217;s a shame
    </li>
    <li>
      Credit Unions in the US have offered lower interest alternatives to Payday Loans with much success. In Wisconsin, <a href="https://www.prospera.ca/">Prospera</a> credit union has <a href="http://www.goodmoneystore.com/">GoodMoney</a> loans, Based within Goodwill stores these loans charge half the interest of payday lenders.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
