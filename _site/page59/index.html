        Libraries are no longer relevant

    <span class="post-date">22 Feb 2013</span>

    <p>At least they aren&#8217;t according to <a href="http://horrible-histories.co.uk/books">Horrible Histories</a> author, <a href="http://www.terry-deary.com/">Terry Deary</a>.</p>

<p>During 2011-12, Deary&#8217;s books were borrowed more than 500,000 times, making him the seventh most-borrowed children&#8217;s writer from UK libraries last year. According to those numbers, he would have also been paid the maximum possible amount for a writer from the <a href="http://www.plr.uk.com/">UK Public Lending Right scheme</a>. This gives authors 6.2p every time one of their books is borrowed, up to a £6,600. Deary is arguing that if someone were to have purchased the book instead of borrowing it from the library, he would be getting 30p per copy, bringing his total up to £180,000.</p>

<p>I find the math is a bit off with this one. Deary is assuming that the <em>each individual person</em> who borrowed his books was actually willing to purchase them in the first place. Completely ignoring the fact that libraries actually pay for the books, and the fact that the people reading his copies may have no interest whatsoever to purchase anything. He&#8217;s calculating earnings that don&#8217;t exist.</p>

<p>Deary claims that &#8220;books aren&#8217;t public property, and writers aren&#8217;t Enid Blyton, middle-class women indulging in a pleasant little hobby. They&#8217;ve got to make a living. Authors, booksellers and publishers need to eat. We don&#8217;t expect to go to a food library to be fed.&#8221;</p>

<p>He then goes on to say that &#8220;this is not the Victorian age, when we wanted to allow the impoverished access to literature. We pay for compulsory schooling to do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Horrible comments aside, I feel a strong need to point out that libraries are not just for book distribution. They&#8217;re pivotal community centres, and a place where everyone is welcome. Not to mention the fact that libraries actually <em>create readers</em>. I can&#8217;t even count how many authors I&#8217;ve been introduced to just by going to the library and taking out random books. Books that I would then read, return, and then go straight to a book store to purchase my own copy.</p>

<p>Not to mention the fact that I tend to glorify my favorite authors to everyone I know until they also buy their own copies (or I purchase one and literally place it in their hands to read if they refuse to purchase their own).</p>

<p>After all, good literature should be <em>shared, </em>don&#8217;t you agree?</p>
