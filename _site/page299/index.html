<p style="text-align: left;">
  Seriously, how did tomatoes get to be so awful? No taste. Mealy texture. But all the while red and round.
</p>

<p>This tomato problem is not unlike the problem with poor communications. And, the crux of the issue is often very much the same.</p>

<p>Check out this passage from Barry Estabrook&#8217;s <a href="http://politicsoftheplate.com/?page_id=831">Tomatoland</a> with the revealing sub-title *How Modern Industrial Agriculture Destroyed Our Most Alluring Fruit. *In this passage, Estabrook is talking to Harry Klee, a tomato breeder who is trying to save the tomato from it&#8217;s currently tasteless existence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you ask commercial seed companies why they are making tomato varieties that have lost all their flavor, the answer is very simple&#8230;They have focused all their energies on their customers. Who are their customers? The commercial growers. What does a grower get paid for? Yield, size and appearance&#8230;so you have a fundamental disconnect between what growers want and what consumers expect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ask yourself; are you growing tomatoes for the wrong consumer? Are you producing something that looks like communications but isn&#8217;t actually appealing to anyone who could really care about what you stand for?</p>

<p>** Here&#8217;s are five ways you can tell:</p>

<ol>
<li> Your copy is so loaded with acronyms that only someone from your organization could understand what (the hell) you&#8217;re talking about</li>
<li> There&#8217;s only one page on your site that talks to the people who are your end consumers and  it&#8217;s buried somewhere. Oh yeah, and it&#8217;s not the least bit compelling.</li>
<li> Your site&#8217;s &#8220;About Us&#8221; page starts with your mission&#8211;the same one written by a consultant gathering dust  on the wall of your reception area</li>
<li> The only people following you on social networks are your friends and family or industry types. You don&#8217;t know who to follow, and heck, Twitter&#8217;s dumb anyway</li>
<li> You&#8217;ve thought about blogging but can&#8217;t think of what you&#8217;d possibly say that could be of interest to anyone</li>
</ol>

<p>If this sounds like you, take the approach that tomato breeder Harry Klee takes in Estabrook&#8217;s book. Figure out the right &#8220;flavor profile&#8221; of your communications message. Here&#8217;s what Klee has to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no one perfect tomato&#8230;.We&#8217;ve found that Hispanic people prefer harder; more tart tomatoes than northeasterners. Probably because Hispanics are going to chop up a tomato and put it in salsa, while someone in the Northeast might slice it and put it in a sandwich. Different uses, different tomatoes. But there are some common traits. I think we can find them and re-create a pretty good tomato.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#8217;s the tomato metaphor laid bare:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Hispanics and northeasterners = different communities of interest who might come to your organization from their own personal areas of interest</li>
<li>  Tomatoes for salsa vs. tomatoes for sandwiches are the different needs of these communities of interest</li>
<li>  The &#8220;Common traits&#8221; = the core mission your organization is on that allows you to be useful and relevant to a range of people each with their own interests</li>
</ul>

<p>Get it? The good news is you too can build a better tomato&#8211;or at least try. Strive to create one that&#8217;s tasty and can be good in a salad, a salsa or in a sandwich. The question is what are the core &#8216;genetic traits&#8217; that make up who you are? What&#8217;s the core flavour profile that will allow you to be adaptable and yet stand for something with integrity.</p>

<p>Now go make a sandwich.</p>
