<p>I think the way people buy, is to get them to be <em>enthusiastic.</em> I’ve always thought, people don’t buy on price. They buy on whether or not they care about what you are doing. So, all I have to do is to make you care and hopefully we will get your business! I don’t think people care about advertising anymore</p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">A Wiggly Mission</span></h3>

<p>Answer these questions for me:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Why don&#8217;t you have a worm composter?</li>
<li>  Why don&#8217;t you have tomatoes growing in your backyard in summer?</li>
<li>  Why haven&#8217;t you started growing plants from seed?</li>
</ul>

<p>To my mind, for those who are inclined there&#8217;s only one answer; because it all seems like more than you can manage&#8211;either it&#8217;s &#8220;too complicated&#8221; or takes &#8220;too much time.&#8221; In life&#8217;s cost/benefit analysis, the benefits simply aren&#8217;t outweighing the costs.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wigglywigglers.co.uk">Wiggly Wigglers</a>, a Natural Gardening Company based in rural Herefordshire, UK has you all figured out. Their tagline &#8220;The Good Life, Made Easy &#8221; sums up the company&#8217;s twofold mission to:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Demonstrate that a life in harmony with nature is &#8220;the good life&#8221;–well worth the time and effort</li>
<li>  Make accessing this &#8220;good life&#8221; manageable for anyone</li>
</ul>

<p>The way they do this is by creating a passionate &#8216;community of interest&#8217; that brings together the people who are taking steps (one step or one hundred and eleven steps) toward living in harmony with nature&#8211;the good life. These people may be environmentalists, gardeners, parents with kids, urban folks with rural dreams, etc. But, together they form a community of interest who want to improve their relationship to the earth and nature.</p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">Manifesting their mission</span></h3>

<h4><span style="font-weight: normal;">Create educational resources</span></h4>

<p>** **The company&#8217;s leaders Heather Gorringe and Farmer Phil provide teaching tools to help people figure out what to do with a worm composter, a birdfeeder or how to plant from seed. Sure that means more composters, birdfeeders or seeds are sold, but their passion for expanding the movement comes first.Wiggly Wigglers engages this community of interest in several ways, all of which are clear manifestations of their core mission.</p>

<p>Check out this video (with over 10,000 views!) demonstrating how to get started with a basic worm composter. It&#8217;s not just the content to take note of, it&#8217;s the <em>tone.</em></p>

<p>Heather is dressed in her regular, everyday clothes. No hair, no makeup. And there&#8217;s a general sense of good-humor happening as they talk about worm composting.  This is not Martha Stewart with an air of refinement and a layer of distance. These are just plain &#8216;ol people like you and me.</p>

<p>In fact, they have an entire <a href="http://www.wigglywigglers.co.uk/cinema/index.html">Wiggly Cinema</a> chock-a-block with educational videos that help build one&#8217;s natural gardening skills.</p>

</p>

<h4><span style="font-weight: normal;">Demonstrate Rural Cred</span></h4>

<p>You&#8217;ve heard of street cred, right? Well this Heather Gorringe and Farmer Phil are oozing rural cred. Their weekly  <a href="http://www.wigglywigglers.co.uk/podcasts">&#8220;Wiggly Podcasts&#8221; </a>are on serious topics related to rural life&#8211;topics that are not directly related to their business–like <em>cattle disease</em> and <em>neglected woodlands</em>.</p>

<p>The podcasts demonstrate Wiggly Wigglers&#8217; deep commitment to and knowledge of rural life. After listening to one, you can have no doubt that these folks are the real deal.</p>

<h4><span style="font-weight: normal;">Building Community</span></h4>

<p>Wiggly Wigglers is all about community. As they say on their About Us page:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;One of the best things about buying Wiggly is that you become part of the growing Wiggly Community.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, when you marry the Wiggly Wigglers, the whole Wiggly family shows up and parks their Winnebago in your backyard.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s because Wiggly Wigglers is on a mission to celebrate a particular approach to the &#8220;good life.&#8221; Importantly, this is not Wiggly Wigglers grandstanding their idea&#8211;it&#8217;s about creating a forum for the community to collectively showcase how grand the good life can be. Wiggly Wigglers just provides the framework for them to do it.</p>

<p>Check out this <a href="http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=3120520301&amp;topic=17477">Facebook discussion page </a>where the site moderators bounce questions out to the community rather than simply answering them. This is Wiggly Wigglers&#8217; style.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-4321 alignleft" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" title="Wiggly Wigglers Facebook note demonstrating community engagement" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-21-at-3.42.38-PM.png" alt="" width="548" height="258" />Beyond education, the community is a place for people to share their pride in what they&#8217;re doing&#8211;to get gold stars for taking one step further down the path to natural living.  Several wall posts are simply people declaring how much they love the products they&#8217;ve ordered.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-4322 alignleft" title="Screen shot 2011-03-22 at 10.21.57 AM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-22-at-10.21.57-AM.png" alt="" width="571" height="157" /></p>

<p>And check out the kinds of pictures people have posted of their Wiggly Wiggler stuff–from 1/2 frozen worms to innovative use for packaging. Owner Heather Gorringe is just one member of a community that is flourishing around a shared passion for natural gardening.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-4323 alignleft" title="Screen shot 2011-03-22 at 10.23.11 AM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-22-at-10.23.11-AM.png" alt="" width="425" height="239" /></p>

<p>Between the educational and celebratory dimensions of their mission, Wiggly Wigglers has stripped away all of the barriers to engagement. Suddenly it&#8217;s well worth the time and effort required to take the steps to live in harmony with nature.</p>

<p>Can you think of other brands so clearly living their mission?</p>
