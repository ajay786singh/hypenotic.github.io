        I’m Gonna Wash That Brand…
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">05 Aug 2010</span>

    <p>When I go to the bathroom in restaurants, I often think about the soap. <a rel="attachment wp-att-2661" href="http://hypenotic.com/branding/2649/2649/attachment/screen-shot-2010-08-05-at-3-22-28-pm"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2661" title="Screen shot 2010-08-05 at 3.22.28 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-05-at-3.22.28-PM.png" alt="" width="296" height="241" /></a>The soap has become a fixation for me because I always ask myself: did they or didn&#8217;t they refill the expensive-brand soap dispenser with cheap soap?</p>

<p>When I see a <a href="http://www.methodhome.com/">Method</a> dispenser, the series of questions begins:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do they really use Method soap?</p>

<p>How many people wash their hands here? That&#8217;s expensive.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s probably not Method. Wait, let me smell it. I don&#8217;t think so.</p>

<p>Why don&#8217;t they just put the cheaper brand in here?</p>

<p>How do I feel about this fraud?</p>

<p>Why do I care?</p>

<p>Why am I such a victim of branding?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The soap becomes a distraction from the dining experience and my perception of the restaurant. Truth is, they&#8217;d be better to either use a generic (so as to be invisible) soap dispenser, or something totally unique (in order to say something about themselves.)</p>

<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-2651" href="http://hypenotic.com/branding/2649/2649/attachment/screen-shot-2010-08-05-at-2-57-54-pm"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2651" title="Screen shot 2010-08-05 at 2.57.54 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-05-at-2.57.54-PM.png" alt="" width="376" height="467" /></a>Herein lies the trouble with Jennifer Aniston&#8217;s celebrity endorsement of <a href="http://www.glaceau.com/">Smart Water</a>.</p>

<p>Like soap, water is a parity product. Whatever it&#8217;s called, it more or less does the job. Drawing attention to the whole branding game thus becomes a big-hairy distraction.</p>

<p>No one loathes Jennifer Aniston more than Canada&#8217;s own <a href="http://www.laineygossip.com">Laineygossip.com</a>. In fact, Lainey&#8217;s most recent rant on Aniston sums up the problem with her endorsement of Smart Water. I</p>

<p>In this month&#8217;s issue of <a href="http://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/fashion-articles/jennifer-aniston-barbra-streisand-pictures-0910">Harper&#8217;s Bazzar</a> Aniston pays homage to Barbara Steisand in a photo shoot. <a href="http://www.laineygossip.com/Jennifer_Aniston_as_Barbra_Streisand_Harpers_Bazaar_04aug10.aspx?CatID=0&amp;CelID=67">Lainey&#8217;s response is swift and harsh</a><a href="http://www.laineygossip.com/Jennifer_Aniston_as_Barbra_Streisand_Harpers_Bazaar_04aug10.aspx?CatID=0&amp;CelID=67">,</a> and then she has a moment of self-reflection:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So would Streisand make movies like *The Bounty Hunter *over and over and over again? Movies that depict women one dimensionally who can only be fulfilled by a man and love?</p>

<p>You ask me why I’m hard on Jennifer Aniston. I’m hard on her because the game she sells sounds so good but the game she actually plays is the worst fraud there is. Jennifer Aniston is not an example. Jennifer Aniston is what we shouldn’t. And Jennifer Aniston is certainly NOT Barbra Streisand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this my friends is precisely why Smart Water made a big, huge mistep in casting Jennifer Aniston as it&#8217;s spokesmodel. Using an actor who &#8220;sounds so good&#8230;but the game she actually plays is the worst fraud ever&#8221; thrusts me back into  the mindset of the soap conundrum.</p>

<p>The fraud of Jennifer Aniston highlights the fraud of selling water, of branding, of all that&#8217;s good and right with the world.</p>

<p>And the more her abs look like a washboard, the more distracted I become (how much does she work out? what does her life look like?&#8230;) And I&#8217;m not alone. As soon as the ad was published, folks started speculating about <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/18/jennifer-aniston-bares-ri_n_580319.html">Aniston&#8217;s diet. </a>And, others have used the absurdity of Aniston&#8217;s endorsement to highlight more important issues, such as <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/18/jennifer-aniston-bares-ri_n_580319.html">lack of  access to clean water.</a></p>

<p>So, you can choose to be great or choose be invisible. If you land somewhere in the middle you risk drawing attention to the effort&#8211;which really defeats the purpose.</p>

<p>What celebrity endorsements do you think work? Do they ever work? As <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqPiJ0L7YmY">Linda Richmond</a> would say,  talk among yourselves.</p>
