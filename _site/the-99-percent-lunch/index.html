<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our fateful leader Barry is off in NYC today at the <a href="http://the99percent.com/conference">99 Percent Conference.</a> The conference&#8217;s tag line is &#8220;It&#8217;s not about ideas. It&#8217;s about making them happen.&#8221; So we&#8217;re expecting him to come back pretty inspired.</p>

<p>We found some inspiration of our own today. While the boss was away, the entire Hypenotic crew took a Cinco de Mayo road trip to have lunch at <a href="http://goodfoodrevolution.wordpress.com/2011/04/26/just-opened-agave-y-aguacate/">Agave y Aguacate</a> in Kensington Market. Turns out Agave y Aguacate is a living case study in how to make ideas happen and get others to relish the experience of sharing someone else&#8217;s vision.</p>

<p>I had heard about this great new Mexican &#8220;restaurant&#8221; from several sources&#8211;<a href="http://www.ediblecommunities.com/toronto/">Edible Toronto</a>,  <a href="http://www.ivyknight.com/">Ivy Knight</a> and others  I trust. I called up the owner Francisco Alejandri to see if he was open for dinner, since I was considering going there with a friend Friday night. He said he was only open for lunch, so I rounded up the troops and off we went.</p>

<p>One step inside and I realized why my dinner question was so absurd. This wasn&#8217;t a restaurant at all (there were no chairs, no tables, not even a stool) it&#8217;s a food stall situated among other Latin American food vendors, tucked into a tiny shop on Augusta Street. It&#8217;s a postage stamp. Boy, had I pictured it differently.</p>

<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean it was a disappointment. In fact, it was an entirely memorable dining experience.</p>

<p>First there&#8217;s the <em>red</em> wall. It sets Agave y Aguacate apart from all of the other vendors that share the space. Their signs are vinyl and the usual standard fare. His just looks amazing. Much of the time I spent waiting for my food to be prepared I spent wondering how the other vendors manage their resentment as the line builds in front of Francisco&#8217;s tiny induction stove. Of course the line had a lot to do with the food but that magnificent wall made this spot stand out. And flourishes like this are in no way incidental. The chef knows the red wall is significant because *every single photo *on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-friends-of-agave-y-aguacate/136407583090840">his facebook page </a>is taken in front of this wall. That wall is partly what gives the restaurant a presence much bigger than its physical size.</p>

</p>

<p>In a great article written by Kelly Jones for  <a href="http://goodfoodrevolution.wordpress.com/2011/04/26/just-opened-agave-y-aguacate/">Good Food Revolution</a> Francisco commented on the red wall:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I want a place that satisfies all your senses. You know, this is why I did the mural. The aromas of the food, and the way it looks, the way I dress—everything, everything has a repercussion to the dishes that I make.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then there&#8217;s the food preparation. I&#8217;m not going to lie to you, it&#8217;s an agonizing wait. As Kelly Jones put it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can come and meet Francisco and sample his fare, but be prepared to wait—even if you’re the only person in line. Each plate is made to order—as in, nothing is sliced, diced, minced, or scooped ahead of time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Initially, there seems to be something incongruous about a food stand where the food is meticulously and oh-so-slowly prepared. The wait is outrageous. Under any other circumstances I&#8217;d be incensed. If I was waiting for take out food at some generic joint, I would have left, and made a lot of noise on the way out.</p>

<p>But watching the process made the food well worth waiting for. In fact, watching Francisco cook was a valuable lesson in why it&#8217;s essential to have the patience to do things right. Even as the line grew, the Chef kept his cool, never waivering from preparing his food as if it were the first time he&#8217;d ever made that particular dish.</p>

<p>The phone is always ringing, the email inbox grows; that&#8217;s how business goes. But regardless, it&#8217;s essential to do the job right, no matter how busy you get. It&#8217;s nice to be reminded of it once in a while. Heck, it&#8217;s nice to have deep thoughts while waiting for my lunch.</p>

<p>So, while Barry&#8217;s at a conference about turning vision into reality, I&#8217;m pretty sure the rest of us here at Hypenotic got an up close view of what it takes to stand true to visionary ideas no matter what. And, while the Tostadas were incredibly good, watching that happen before my eyes was even better.</p>
