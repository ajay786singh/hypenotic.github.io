    <p><a title="Microsofts new responsive website" href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft</a> has gone <a title="Nishant Kothari tells the story of the new Microsoft.com" href="http://rainypixels.com/words/the-story-of-the-new-microsoft-com/" target="_blank">responsive</a>. They employed a three person team called <a title="Paravel Agency website" href="http://paravelinc.com/" target="_blank">Paravel</a> with a care for craft. In the most traditional sense–if there were a guild of web designers, Paravel would be in it, because they&#8217;ve been sharing and improving the craft as they&#8217;ve moved ahead with it.</p>

<p>There are more restaurants with themes, missions and codes within walking distance of my house than I can get to before I retire and have significantly more free time.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s <a title="Make Magazine website" href="http://makezine.com/" target="_blank">Make</a> magazine, <a title="Maker Faire website" href="http://makerfaire.com/" target="_blank">maker faires</a>, and one of a kind shows riding on the currents of DIY and Craft movements.</p>

<p>There are 37 Farmer&#8217;s markets in Toronto. The concept is becoming more mainstream. They&#8217;re popping up where people work and play, loaded with artisans and producers who bring a stewardship approach to their work.</p>

<p>Typography is making it&#8217;s way back into the mainstream as new technologies allow for the use of more typefaces online, and awareness of how to manipulate it intelligently and creatively spreads.</p>

<p>Slow Food Toronto is campaigning to get people to <a title="Slow Food Toronto's terra Madre Day" href="http://slowfood.to/events/terra-madre-day-2012-made-from-scratch/" target="_blank">cook from scratch</a> for this year&#8217;s Terra Madre Day.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s way old news that <a title="Hypenotic article about Urban Outfitter ripping off Etsy designs " href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/5478/etsy-vs-urban-outfitters-what-does-it-say-about-us" target="_blank">Urban Outfitters imitates Etsy artists</a>, and when mass fashion imitates ironic internet crafters, you know craft is going mainstream.</p>

<p>The no bullshit Green Party of Ontario is trying to help <a title="Green Party of Ontario Website" href="http://www.gpo.ca/media-release/break-foreign-beer-store-monopoly-and-support-local-craft-breweries" target="_blank">break the foreign-owned Beer Store monopoly</a> so that a healthy craft beer industry can grow to serve local economies.</p>

<p>Long story short–I know the title is hyperbolic. We&#8217;ll always have big industry for certain things.</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s apparent and refreshing to note that in big cities and via the internet, it&#8217;s getting easier to get your hands on that thing you care about. That bite, drink, toy, gift, hobby, indulgence, tool or widget that you know something about.</p>

<p>The one that sounds, tastes, feels, looks or smells better because someone sourced just the right ingredients, components or materials. The one with details you&#8217;ll appreciate for a long time to come because someone spent more time on it. The one that feels better to give because of the story attached to it. The one you&#8217;ll keep because it connects you to a person, place, sensation or sensibility.</p>

<p>In an era of polarizing ideologies and politics, I think we&#8217;re seeing a polarization of consumerism. We&#8217;ve been trained to consume over the last 50 years and the itch doesn&#8217;t stay scratched for long. Yet the repeated and pervasive hollowness of increasingly disposable stuff is affecting the nature of our yearning. Consumption isn&#8217;t enough.</p>

<p>Speaking of stories, this is the 5th anniversary of <a title="The Story of Stuff Website" href="http://www.storyofstuff.org/movies-all/story-of-stuff/" target="_blank">the Story of Stuff</a>. Now up to their eighth production, few organizations have done more to help us understand why wanton consumption is worse than just unfulfilling. If you haven&#8217;t seen it, start here:</p>

<p>Do yourself a favour for the holidays. Screw convenience and find the time to buy meaningful gifts (whatever that means to you). Try to stop your company from sending out holiday cards and calendars that go straight in the recycler (at best).</p>

<p>If you have to do something promotional, buy sweatshop free gifts from B Corps like <a title="Fairware" href="http://www.fairware.com/" target="_blank">Fairware</a>, <a title="Ecojot Website" href="http://www.ecojot.com/" target="_blank">Ecojot</a>, <a title="Saul Good Gift Co" href="http://www.itsaulgood.com/" target="_blank">Saul Good</a> or <a title="Etsy.com" href="http://www.etsy.com/" target="_blank">Etsy</a>.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s the expression?:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When you buy something cheap and poorly made, the best you&#8217;ll ever feel about it is the day you bought it. If you buy something pricer but well made, the worst you&#8217;ll ever feel about it is the day you bought it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Welcome artisanal era.</p>
