        Locawashing vs. The Authenticity Hoax
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">27 Sep 2010</span>

    <p><a rel="attachment wp-att-3022" href="http://hypenotic.com/meaningfulmarketing/3013/locawashing-vs-the-authenticity-hoax/attachment/screen-shot-2010-09-27-at-3-57-09-pm"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3022" title="Screen shot 2010-09-27 at 3.57.09 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Screen-shot-2010-09-27-at-3.57.09-PM.png" alt="" width="322" height="243" /></a>Greenwashing, and its variants are not new. Because values sell, marketers flaunt their faux-values to attract sales when there is, in fact, very little to substantiate their lofty claims.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a fun greenwashing game called <a href="http://sinsofgreenwashing.org/games-tools/name-that-sin-game/">Name that Sin</a> that encourages you to identify which deceiving tactic brands are using to trick you into thinking they are environmentally friendly.</p>

<p>It should not be surprising that the local food movement has its own version of greenwashing&#8211;let&#8217;s call it <a href="http://www.newrules.org/node/2853/">Locawashing</a>.</p>

<p>Two recent examples have given me new cause to consider the meaning and impact of Locawashing; The first is the prevalence of <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703399404575506562162038450.html">fake Farmers Market stands</a> set up by major retailers like Albertson&#8217;s in the US; The second is Canada Bread&#8217;s <a href="http://www.countryharvest.com/en/community/canadian-wheat">Country Harvest</a> brand featuring ads and POP materials featuring the faces of the <em>real</em> farmers who make their wheat&#8211;which then gets turned into processed bread.</p>

<p>Often the conversation  about these issues revolves around language. What is a farmers market? What does local mean? Who is a locavore? As per the case with Safeway and Albertsons setting up Farmers Markets at the front steps of their stores, there&#8217;s a concern about what these terms mean once they are appropriated by industry:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Farmers and their supporters have spent several decades building &#8220;farmers&#8217; market&#8221; into a brand that signifies something specific to consumers, namely, locally grown produce fresh off the farm&#8230;there is a fear on the part of farmers&#8217; groups that the term could become so diluted that the public no longer feels the need to visit the real thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We want these terms to mean something <em>real. *We want to see/feel/touch the *real *thing when we go to Farmer&#8217;s markets. Is there something suspicious in *our</em> desire for authenticity?</p>

<p>In his new book <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Authenticity-Hoax-Lost-Finding-Ourselves/dp/0771071051">The Authenticity Hoax</a> (<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/thenextchapter/2010/09/andrew-potter.html">streamed version available from CBC interview available here</a>) Andrew Potter argues that the search for the *real *or *authentic *is at the root of many of our current problems. He sees the search for authenticity as &#8220;dopey nostalgia.&#8221; Potter sees the local food movement as socially pernicious because it helps people &#8220;feel good&#8221; (e.g. buying local makes me feel good, spiritually) but it keeps them from questioning whether that serves a higher, &#8220;real&#8221; social good (impacting the environment, our health, etc.)</p>

<p>What do you think? Is there something suspicious about wanting terms like local and farmers market to mean something? Is Potter onto something? Should we preserve the integrity of these terms so that the fake versions don&#8217;t pass as real? How would we do that anyway?</p>
