<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A big sign on the QEW announced &#8220;Fur Is Green.&#8221; I don&#8217;t often fall for &#8216;teaser&#8217; campaigns, but this one had my curiosity piqued.</p>

<p><a href="ttp://www.furisgreen.com/">The campaign</a> from the <a href="http://www.furcouncil.com/home.aspx">Fur Council of Canada</a> makes the case that fur is a sound environmental choice. The claim may or may not be true. But that&#8217;s not why I&#8217;m choosing to spend time thinking about it. I&#8217;m more interested in pulling apart some of the rhetorical devices the Fur Council is using to make its case:</p>

<p><strong>Apples to Apples: </strong></p>

<p>The campaign depends on measuring environmental impact of real animal Fur by comparing it to Faux Fur products made from petroleum:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Real fur is an organic material. « Faux fur » (fake fur) and most synthetics are made from petrochemicals. Like other plastics, these materials do not break down easily and will remain in landfills for centuries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At first it sounds compelling, but let&#8217;s remember, not every person who opts out of wearing real fur goes out to get a faux fur coat in its place. There are may choices along the spectrum&#8211;some more green then others, many more green than petroleum based faux fur. But this little rhetorical device does it&#8217;s job rather well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Historical Smoke and Mirrors:</strong></p>

<p>Harkening back to a better, simpler time, the site talks about trappers, artisans and family farms as if not a minute has rolled by since Hudson&#8217;s Bay set up shop:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fur trade also maintains centuries-old craft traditions: each fur garment is individually cut and sewn by skilled artisans. The men and women of the North American fur trade are proud of the skills and traditions they maintain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fur industry is an $800 million dollar industry in Canada and much has changed over the last 300 years. Getting an industry up to that scale requires streamlining and modernization methods that are generally not in the best interests of the environment.</p>

<p>Anyway, we all know that just something has been done for a long time does not mean it&#8217;s something we want to continue doing today. Hello, anyone heard of slavery?</p>

<p><a href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/7783/is-wearing-fur-really-green-or-just-great-green-washing/attachment/screen-shot-2011-11-25-at-1-25-56-pm" rel="attachment wp-att-7789"><img class="size-full wp-image-7789 aligncenter" title="Screen shot 2011-11-25 at 1.25.56 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-shot-2011-11-25-at-1.25.56-PM.png" alt="" width="459" height="293" /></a><strong>Greedwashing:</strong></p>

<p>The Fur Council spends a lot of time letting you know that* other* organizations (namely non-profits like <a href="http://www.peta.org/">Peta</a>) are greedy, thereby positioning themselves as the insider/informant who by extension is not greedy.</p>

<p>In their FAQ section they respond to the question &#8220;are those videos I&#8217;ve seen real?&#8221; referring to videos of animal cruelty likely circulating on the internet. The answer is quite telling:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately there are many documented incidents of activist groups <a href="http://www.furcommission.com/news/newsC7.htm" target="_blank">“staging” horrible videos to fuel their fund-raising drives</a>. They do this because the stakes are high! Animal activist groups now rake in millions of dollars with sensationalized, media-driven campaigns.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hmmm&#8230;.I&#8217;m willing to believe that there are unscrupulous non-profit organizations out there, but let&#8217;s face it, the fur industry has a huge stake in convincing the public that fur is a &#8220;good&#8221; option. After all, even <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/26/business/fur-industry-shrinking-with-no-end-in-sight.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm">Hudson&#8217;s Bay </a>closed its fur department in 1991. The New York Times said the choice was based on &#8220;the relentless campaigning of animal rights advocates and plunging demand that began with the 1987 stock market crash.&#8221;</p>

<p>Today there are fur departments in selected Bay stores. To put it mildly,  let&#8217;s just say the fur industry would like to keep it that way. In other words, if the stakes are high for PETA, they&#8217;re even higher for the Fur Association.</p>

<p>*<em>Infantilizing Anti-Fur Activists: *</em></p>

<p>****In response to a FAQ question &#8220;How can the use of animal to make a luxury product ever be ethical?&#8221; the site provides this, rather humorous response:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most of us grew up with wonderful stories of Mama Bear and Baby Bear and we all love Bambi. But Nature is not Disneyland.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wow. I think it&#8217;s fair to assume that Anti-Fur activists are concerned about much more than the loss of <em>cartoon-species</em>.</p>

<p>There are real concerns about the chemicals used to skin, produce and maintain fur once it&#8217;s hit the store shelves. This is what PETA refers to as &#8220;a soup of toxic chemicals.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, many of the concerns are about the treatment of animals, but of course it&#8217;s not romanticized ideas about Bambi that are on the minds of animal activists. It&#8217;s much more serious issues like factory farming, cruelty, etc.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the end of the day, it&#8217;s hard to take animals out of the equation when thinking about fur. That&#8217;s why the very line &#8220;Fur is green&#8221; is so provocative. But would it be worth evaluating fur on it&#8217;s environmental merit&#8211;as divorced from environmental issues? Is there any way you could be convinced that fur is green? I&#8217;m (clearly) having a hard time being objective on this one.</p>
