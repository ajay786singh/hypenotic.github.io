I started drinking coffee in grade 4. Granted, it was watered down with milk and honey, but it was coffee none-the-less. I was an instant addict- just one possible explanation for my 4&#8217;9&#8243; stature. It wasn&#8217;t until seven years later that the concept of fair trade coffee first drifted into my life. Since then it has been a pervasive force, prodding at my conscience from the sidelines of a Second Cup line up or tripping up my order at Starbucks.</p>

<p>For most of us, fair trade is that label that turns delicious coffee into delicious coffee that makes you a <em>good</em> person. Who wouldn&#8217;t mind spending an extra buck [sometimes less!] to wear the good samaritan hat? The thing is, fair trade coffee is about as black and white as coffee itself and it takes a bit of digging to sort through the mud.</p>

<p><strong>The Mission of Fair Trade</strong><br>
According to <a href="http://www.iied.org/">IIED</a>, &#8220;Fair Trade is a trading partnership with aims at sustainable development for excluded and disadvantaged producers&#8221;.</p>

<p><em>That involves:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>  Implementing a floor price for coffee with the intention of receiving market price if the market price exceeds the floor price.</li>
<li>  Eliminating the &#8220;middle man&#8221; and giving farmers access to importers.</li>
<li>  Giving farmers a sustainable source of income to weather out bad seasons</li>
<li>  Giving farmers access to market information, allowing for getter production planning related to demand</li>
<li>  Organizing farmers into coop groups that pool beans to be sold under the fair trade label.</li>
</ul>

<p>All in all it seems like a good thing, after all, farmers have enough problems what with the economy and the weather constantly threatening their source of income. Why not create a system that works for coffee lovers and coffee growers. The question is, does it work?</p>

<p><strong>Debating Fair Trade Coops</strong><br>
<em>Pro</em></p>

<ul>
<li>  The advantage of the set minimum price gives farmers price stability which allows for better planning.</li>
<li>  Part of the coop program allows farmers access to credit at reasonable rates. Without this option, farmers suffering from the volatile coffee market would be subject to borrowing at unreasonable interest rates through other means.</li>
<li>  The coop program also gives farmers training in organic production, leading to quality improvement and best practices. This not only improves crops but benefits the environment and leads to reduced soil erosion.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Con</em></p>

<ul>
<li>  The cost of the fair trade certification is born by producers and it can be expensive to be part of a coop.</li>
<li>  The FLO certification must be renewed/year at a cost of $500 plus 15 cents per kilogram of coffee sold under FLO conditions.</li>
<li>  Superior quality of beans is not always considered in fair trade, therefore, in some cases, farmers have a chance of charging higher prices in the conventional market.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Is All Fair Trade Equal?</strong><br>
You may have encountered the confusing situation of being presented with multiple fair trade labels and wondered why the forces of good can&#8217;t be more clear about what good is. The biggest controversy in the fair trade label lies between <a href="http://www.google.ca/aclk?sa=l&amp;ai=CLIoQFSyRUaqIHKmByQH92oGABrnDj7sDoZvtwlzU3rawCQgAEAFQ_eHT2v3_____AWD9oJmB6AOgAZLijP8DyAEBqgQmT9AtqhHElKrZqeoo7vh45H-e-UNQio9gXi3MYawchWBGMpPtShmAB9adcw&amp;sig=AOD64_36eOL_3z7d5z03K0s4FRJ9z_kNKw&amp;rct=j&amp;q=fair+trade+usa&amp;ved=0CDYQ0Qw&amp;adurl=http://www.fairtradeusa.org/">Fair Trade USA</a> and <a href="https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CFEQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fairtrade.net%2F&amp;ei=BCyRUar1KcHkygH17oHYDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNF3hT7HR9bHVujNfzRC7JYAG75osw&amp;sig2=DwhMUjmKgQgHPh_X9hh-sQ&amp;bvm=bv.46340616,d.aWc">Fair Trade International</a>. Each organization has created their own rules for the ethics of coffee and here&#8217;s where they differ:<br>
Where Fair Trade International only works with farmers in coops, Fair Trade USA imports from larger, private growers. On the one hand, Fair Trade International seeks to help farmers build a local economy. Conversely, Fair Trade USA maintains the belief that the demand for the fair trade label is increasing and will overwhelm coops.<br>
Another difference lies in their application of the fair trade label. The Fair Trade USA label is used to denote individual ingredients in a product; even if just one ingredient in a group is from fair trade, the Fair Trade USA label can be applied. Meanwhile, Fair Trade International maintains that 20% of the product&#8217;s contents must be fair trade ingredients for their label to apply.<br>
Other certifications include the <a href="http://www.4c-coffeeassociation.org/">4C Association</a>, <a href="http://www.google.ca/aclk?sa=l&amp;ai=Cj8nQYSyRUd3iHcGByQGs04DgD-asxKgDnrXlnDyq34MXCAAQAVDx4fKqAmD9oJmB6AOgAYbK1OsDyAEBqgQhT9Aym3CtI3ybih7cxhGmRuzw1Bm-DuoRikHiiB9dj4cZgAfitasU&amp;sig=AOD64_2Nrffc33rgp4XqJaZtzbRPcHcReA&amp;rct=j&amp;q=rainforest+alliance+certified&amp;ved=0CDYQ0Qw&amp;adurl=http://www.rainforest-alliance.org/get-certified">Rainforest Alliance Certified</a>, and <a href="https://www.utzcertified.org/">UTZ Certified</a>. Each of which have their own standards of coffee inspection.</p>

<p>Now don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m not saying that fair trade is a bad thing. And heaven forbid I say a word against coffee; the elixir of getting through Monday morning. But I do caution against blindly reaching for a green label. Not all fair trade is the same, not all the money goes to the same place. So make sure you know what you&#8217;re paying into. As for me and my cup, we will support sustainability for growers and the coffee of the future. May we all look forward to many more caffeinated Monday mornings.</p>
