        <h1>Marketing the Farm</h1>
        <p class="meta"><span class="sub-meta">By</span>  <span class="sub-meta">in</span> category</p>
        <p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1784" title="photo-1" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/photo-1.jpg" alt="photo-1" width="216" height="288" />I attended the <a href="http://fieldandforknetwork.com/">Field &amp; Fork Network&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://farmerchefconference.wordpress.com/">Farmer-Chef Conference</a> held in Western New York yesterday. Farmers in this particular area of NY (like many others) have been driven to the brink of bankruptcy and <a href="http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2010/01/post_145.html">worse.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2010/01/post_145.html"></a> The Conferences&#8217; main objective was to explore how farmers, who make locally produced food, can get their food into the hands of consumers and make a living for themselves and their families.</p>

<p>Early in the day, one of the keynote speakers, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2008/10/07/magazine/20081012-STYLE_6.html">Patrick Martins</a> from <a href="http://www.heritagefoodsusa.com/">Heritage Foods USA </a> and<a href="http://www.slowfoodusa.org/"> Slow Food USA </a>spoke about the importance of <em>taste</em> in the Slow Food movement. He remarked that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Slow Food and it&#8217;s founder <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Petrini">Carlo Petrini </a> advocated eating locally insofar as local food tended to taste better. The priority for Slow Food is supporting the production of food that is &#8220;the best&#8221; whether it comes from the local terroir or from another locale.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you can show that your milk, cheese, lamb, etc. is the best, discussions about price, etc. become secondary. Martin&#8217;s emphasized that too often local food producers are satisfied with mediocrity when it comes to taste.</p>

<p>Martin&#8217;s comments resonated with me. I had just the night before read Seth Godin&#8217;s post on the <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/01/the-ubiquity-of-competition.html">Ubiquity of Competition</a> where he concludes (in his uber-succinct Godin way)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to like competition in order to understand that it exists. Your fair share isn&#8217;t going to be yours unless you give the public a reason to pick you.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Local isn&#8217;t enough because there are many who can make stake to this claim. But, as Martin pointed out, &#8220;if a farmer can say <a href="http://www.mariobatali.com/">Mario Batali </a>uses my apples in his apple pie, he&#8217;s got something to talk about.&#8221;</p>

<p>Later in the day I met Pat Manning from <a href="http://www.hudsonvalleyfresh.com/">Hudson Valley Fresh, </a>a non-profit dairy cooperative made up of 9 farms who produce the highest quality milk for sale in the NY area. During his inspiring presentation, Pat focused on the fact that Hudson Valley Fresh&#8217;s milk is truly the freshest. And he can prove it. This milk has lower bacteria counts than other &#8220;dirty&#8221; milk. The milk is guaranteed 36 hours from cow to cup. The cows are treated better than cows on conventional dairy farms.</p>

<p>Why should you or I care about bacteria counts, travel time or how cows are treated? Manning has the answer; &#8221; The milk just plain tastes better.&#8221;  It tastes better than conventional milk, and it tastes better than other premium dairies (90 in the Hudson Valley region alone) who didn&#8217;t make the cut to be one of the 9 farms that provide milk for Hudson Valley Fresh. And farmers from one of his 9 farms are regulars in local shops and store sampling their milk to prove it.</p>

<p>As a consumer, we have many, many options to choose from. Food producers need to think about what they have that no one else can lay claim to.</p>

<p>Does your pork come from a heritage pig that has a distinct taste? Has your method of making scones been praised by Martha Stewart? Is your milk the favourite of baristas because it froths like none other?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Being local is just the cost of entry. Once you&#8217;re at the Farmers&#8217; Market you&#8217;re stall to stall with others who share that claim to fame.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a tall order. Especially when you understand that farmers and food producers are already burdened with an incredible number of responsibilities. But from where I stand, the future of farming and food production lay with those who get that Ubiquity of Competition is inevitable. And only the unique will survive.</p>
