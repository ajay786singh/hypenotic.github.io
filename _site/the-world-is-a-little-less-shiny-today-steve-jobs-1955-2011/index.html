        <h1>The World is a Little Less Shiny Today &#8211; Steve Jobs 1955-2011</h1>
        <p class="meta"><span class="sub-meta">By</span>  <span class="sub-meta">in</span> category</p>
        <p>I am a proud Apple fangirl.  From my iPhone to my Airport my electronic and computing life is completely mac.  It is a love affair that started 7 years ago when my ex gave me the first generation iPod nano for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrismukkah">Christmukka</a>.  Shortly after that I moved into a career with Apple retail, and that&#8217;s how I discovered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_jobs">Steve Jobs</a>.</p>

<p>When I heard he had passed away last night I <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/">cried</a>.  And I thought as I was snuffling through yet another of his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc">keynotes</a> at 1 in the morning, am I crazy to be reacting this way? He was a CEO of company I worked for, and someone I admired but I&#8217;d never met him. His <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7945084053124129040">words</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-events/wwdc-2011/">innovations</a> though had a huge impact on my life.</p>

<p>Before I worked for Apple I was a technophobe.  I used to date people who were computer savvy so that they would take care of my <a href="http://image.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/273049/273049,1288490721,2/stock-photo-a-computer-has-been-infected-by-an-internet-virus-a-scary-bug-is-on-the-laptop-use-it-for-a-64094755.jpg">technology</a> for me.  I had a palm trio and I used it to text, but the calendar was too confusing and I took only the occasional grainy photo.  When I started working at Apple they spent over a month training me  and getting me up to speed.  It opened up a whole new world to me and made me unafraid of technology.  Let me repeat that because I think that is at the heart of what made Steve so innovative, Apple made me UNAFRAID of technology.</p>

<p>After years of owning PCs and going to computer stores where I was <a href="http://dumpalink.com/videos/Nick-Burns-Your-Companys-Computer-Guy-193e.html">talked down to</a> and treated like an idiot here was a place I could learn and ask without fear.  And as an added bonus everything was pretty. This was relatable innovate technology available to most people and I got to sell it.  It was as with most jobs not without it&#8217;s flaws but I <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2011/08/the-steve-jobs-formula-and-why.php">learned a lot</a> working for Steve.  As did my co-workers and most of our customers in the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ca/retail/eatoncentre/">store</a>.  The <a href="http://photoblog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/10/06/8181787-apple-fans-around-the-world-pay-tribute-to-steve-jobs">Apple fans</a> who used to come in and just rave about their laptops and iPods; People who just wanted to talk about how much better Apple products had made their lives were a testament to how Steve Jobs was much more than just a CEO of a good technology company. You just don&#8217;t see that anywhere else, have you ever seen a bunch of people in Best Buy talking about how awesome their Lenovo ThinkPads are?</p>

<p>As a person, he was far from perfect, and he did make some mistakes with Apple but he didn&#8217;t let those failures stop him. He was incredibly savvy, inspirational, brilliant, influential and we&#8217;ll be feeling the impact of <a href="http://xkcd.com/961/">his loss</a> for a very long time.  <a href="http://www.apple.com/ca/stevejobs/">Good bye Steve</a> and thanks.</p>
