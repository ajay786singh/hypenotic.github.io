        Are You Cliterate?

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">30 Aug 2013</span>

    <p>There are many important public education campaigns aimed at helping people get their head around misunderstood issues. Consider how public awareness campaigns helped shift perceptions of the hazards of second hand smoke or how campaigns like <a href="http://www.refugeeweek.org.uk/">London&#8217;s Refugee Week</a> shift perceptions of Refugees from liabilities to assets.</p>

<p>The Cliteracy public education campaign wants to bring the female clitoris into the mainstream so that it can be better understood and seen as an organ that is as political as it is sexual.</p>

<p>Artist <a href="http://sophiawallace.tumblr.com/">Sophia Wallace</a> is out to help the world understand the clitoris. She says</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;It is a curious dilemma to observe the paradox that on the one hand the female body is the primary metaphor for sexuality, its use saturates advertising, art and the mainstream erotic imaginary. Yet, the clitoris, the true female sexual organ, is virtually invisible.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wallace&#8217;s goal was to help people overcome illiteracy when it comes to what the clitoris is and how it works.</p>

<p>She did this through four brilliant tactics:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/11371/are-you-cliterate/attachment/screen-shot-2013-08-30-at-2-59-50-pm" rel="attachment wp-att-11372"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-11372" alt="Screen shot 2013-08-30 at 2.59.50 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-shot-2013-08-30-at-2.59.50-PM.png" width="603" height="465" /></a>
</p>

<p><strong>100 Natural Laws of Cliteracy:</strong></p>

<p>Wallace&#8217;s multimedia art project is a collection of 100 natural laws about the clitoris writ large (10 feet by 13 feet) with the huge, neon word CLITERACY suspended from the ceiling. One such natural law includes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Clitoris from the Greek Kleinton means little hill. More like a mountain the clitoris is 10X larger than the average person realizes.</p>

<p>Another reads</p>

<p>One surgeon in the world repairs the clitoris in women who have undergone genital mutilation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Street Art:</strong></p>

<p>Wallace took her message to the streets, putting up Cliteracy posters all over New York. &#8220;This is an advertising campaign for the clitoris&#8221; she said, adding &#8220;After all, who needs an ad campaign more than the clit?&#8221; Good question.</p>

<p><strong>Clit Rodeo:</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/11371/are-you-cliterate/attachment/screen-shot-2013-08-30-at-3-10-36-pm" rel="attachment wp-att-11373"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-11373" alt="Screen shot 2013-08-30 at 3.10.36 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-shot-2013-08-30-at-3.10.36-PM.png" width="542" height="330" /></a>
</p>

<p>Working with another artist Wallace created a giant golden clitoris and debuted it at a summer festival in New York. The public was invited  perform and dance with the giant clitoris for prizes. The sculpture transformed the &#8220;little hill&#8221; into a huge, shiny and inviting three dimensional object that was intended to make the organ less secretive and mysterious than it&#8217;s been perceived.</p>

<p>For Wallace bringing the clitoris out for public viewing is a highly political act. As she says</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Cliteracy is about not having one&#8217;s body controlled or legislated&#8230;Not having access to the pleasure that is your birthright is a deeply political act.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Clit-Wear:</strong></p>

<p>Wallace is selling <a href="http://collect.sophiawallace.com/category/tees">t-shirts and tank tops on her Tumblr site.</a> The idea is to bring the word clit into public conversation and change the word from something that is spoken about in hushed tones to something people are willing to think and talk about.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve ordered one for Barry. So, if you see him rocking out his &#8220;Solid Gold Clit&#8221; tank at a business meeting, please ask him about it and why he&#8217;s proud to support Cliteracy.</p>
