A trip to their <a href="http://www.leevalley.com/home/page.aspx?c=1&amp;p=53697&amp;cat=">Downtown store </a>embodies the power of living a single idea, simply expressed. Lee Valley sells high quality woodworking and gardening tools and that&#8217;s all they sell. I had an impending kids&#8217; birthday party on my mind as I roamed the aisles, and I was delighted to be <em>disappointed</em> by the absence of kids&#8217; stuff.</p>

<p>Lee Valley is not in the kids&#8217; toys business. If fact they have a decidedly adult approach to craftsmanship.  The long-term benefit of being known for one thing outweighs the short term bang of selling a few cheap kids&#8217; gardening or woodworking toys. In the must-read book <a href="http://37signals.com/rework/">Rework</a>, the authors have a chapter dedicated to the importance of being a curator:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s the stuff you leave out that matters. So constantly look for things to remove, simplify and streamline</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s great advice for brands in general. How many messages are you trying to cram into a single ad? What are you talking about in your blog post? Why do people come to your store?</p>

<p>Last week, <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin</a> wrote a brilliant blog post about the appeal of artisanal products/services in response to decades of conspicuous consumption. The trend (hopefully it&#8217;s not just a trend) is captured by Godin saying it&#8217;s all about &#8220;spending on and investing in <em>time</em>, not stuff.&#8221;</p>

<p>It takes *time *and frankly love to curate. Not being able to curate is like being a hoarder. You&#8217;re so afraid to let go. Why?  Because you&#8217;re afraid to fail. What if someone shows up and I don&#8217;t have what they want? Guess what, that&#8217;s good news. As the Rework Authors state</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You don&#8217;t make a great museum by putting all the art in the world into a single room. That&#8217;s a warehouse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&#8217;t be a warehouse. A warehouse is generic, difficult to navigate, and impossible to be emotionally connected to. Here are a few examples of folks who have succeeded by curating, focusing and bringing lightening precision to their passionate endeavor.</p>
