        Mailbox &#038; Evomail: Email finally gets noticed

    <span class="post-date">18 Feb 2013</span>

    <p><a href="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-10584 alignleft" alt="photo" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-e1361162910815.png" width="250" height="375" /></a>Everyone has various feelings towards email, but they generally fall into the &#8220;necessary evil&#8221; bucket. We need it, we get too much of it, check it way to often and use it as a very inefficient filing system most of the time.</p>

<p>Although it&#8217;s been around in various forms for decades, 1978 marks the year that the first email system was created at <a href="http://theemaillab.org/history-of-email.asp" target="_blank">UMDMJ</a> in Newark, NJ.</p>

<p>Despite it&#8217;s various incarnations, it hasn&#8217;t really changed much since then. You can argue that Hotmail, Gmail and Yahoo! Mail and whatever tried, they really just put new paint on an old car.</p>

<p>Until now.</p>

<p>There seems to be a renewed interest in email and how we manage it with <a href="http://www.mailboxapp.com/" target="_blank">Mailbox</a> and <a href="http://evomail.io/" target="_blank">Evomail</a> leading the charge. Both are mobile apps and they both claim that they want to change the way we interact and think about email. It&#8217;s about time, but not surprising given the fact that mobile email viewing and surfing is skyrocketing.</p>

<p>Just a couple of weeks ago <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/solutions/collateral/ns341/ns525/ns537/ns705/ns827/white_paper_c11-520862.html" target="_blank">Cisco&#8217;s global mobile traffic forecast</a> for 2013 &#8211; 2017 stated that,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By the end of 2013, the number of mobile-connected devices will exceed the number of people on earth, and by 2017 there will be nearly 1.4 mobile devices per capita. There will be over 10 billion mobile-connected devices in 2017, including machine-to-machine (M2M) modules-exceeding the world&#8217;s population at that time (7.6 billion).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, I&#8217;m still waiting to play around with either of these new email clients. Evomail is going to be released sometime early 2013 and I am in the world&#8217;s longest queue to get my hands on Mailbox.</p>

<p>When I signed up for Mailbox I had close to 600,ooo people in front of me. A week later, I&#8217;ve still got 383,567 people ahead of me and  432,529 people behind me. They&#8217;re doing this in order to safely scale up without any problems, but it also highlights the fact that there really is a thirst for better email management. People are tired of email controlling them. They want to be in charge and it seems that&#8217;s the way that Mailbox is being designed.</p>

<p>The big guns better be taking notes. They&#8217;ve got me hooked&#8230;now if only the lineup would hurry up already.</p>
