  <h1 class="post-title">7 tips for writing useful (and usable) web content</h1>
  <span class="post-date">18 Aug 2010</span>
  <span class="post-author"></span>
  <p>My friend Brian is an aeronautical engineer. Several years ago, he explained to me that most things designed for people with disabilities are more accessible for people without disabilities too.</p>

<p>Sounds obvious in hindsight, but if you set out to make what you&#8217;re doing as usable as it can be, you give it the best chance of being used by the most people.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lesson here in writing for the web, where you&#8217;re not only writing for the most impatient audience you&#8217;ll ever meet, but also for search engines, who–while amazing bits of technology, can&#8217;t quite compete with the human brain for processing <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/magazine/20Computer-t.html">certain types of information</a>.</p>

<p>This (much watched) video with comedian Louis CK hilariously illustrates our lack of reverence for the wonders of our digital era.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s no disputing that writing for the web is its own beast. When writing for readers you have to contend with a profound lack of <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/991128.html">patience</a>. You can&#8217;t delay gratification, you have to serve it up quickly and heartily. The bonus is that if you optimize your content for readers you&#8217;ll also be rewarded by search engines. Search engines are measured by how useful the content they serve up is, and, accordingly, are designed to let the best presented content rise to the top.</p>

<p>There are no shortage of places to find proven tips on <a href="http://www.useit.com/papers/webwriting/">writing for the web</a>. Here are some notes I dashed off for a client recently in response to a random post I chose from their site.</p>

<h2>Use media</h2>

<p>There&#8217;s nothing like a video or an image to draw people in. You can use multiple images if it helps. Think of yourself as an editor for a hot magazine–the better this article is curated, the more likely it will be to be read and shared.</p>

<h2>Use links</h2>

<p>Link out to the organizations, profiles and references you mention. If you can send readers out to useful info/resources, you increase the chances of them coming back to us. It&#8217;s social (courteous)–you&#8217;d be tickled to have someone else point to your posts.</p>

<h2>Use &#8220;Block Quotes&#8221;</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Make it easier for readers to approach your writing by employing the visual interestingness afforded by layout elements like block quotes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They also help us see important thoughts or quotes at a glance.</p>

<h2>Chunk your text</h2>

<p>People don&#8217;t read online like they do in print–they scan. Knowing this gives us an opportunity to make it easier on them by writing for scanning.</p>

<p>One great way to do this is to make sure paragraphs don&#8217;t contain more than a single thought/idea. They can have multiple sentences, as long as you lead with the point, with ensuing sentences adding depth for interested readers.</p>

<p>This practice is useful because uninterested readers will simply skip to the next section (typically next paragraph).</p>

<h2>Subheads</h2>

<p>Taking the last point further, it&#8217;s considered good practice on longer posts to use subheads.</p>

<p>Scanners can skip to the sections that interest them and search engines weigh subheads more heavily.</p>

<h2>Voice</h2>

<p>Having an opinion is an important part of building relationships with readers.</p>

<p>Reporting is great, but it should be in the context of an issue we&#8217;re framing. It&#8217;s important because there are a lot of places that report, but few in a position to have an opinion. Opinions:</p>

<ul>
<li>  endear some towards you, increasing the likelihood of being shared.</li>
<li>  polarize others, creating an opinion where there was none before.</li>
<li>  can inflame still others. And there&#8217;s nothing like controversy for getting attention.</li>
</ul>

<p>Try to do all three if possible.</p>

<h2>Ask for feedback</h2>

<p>As they say in the lotto, &#8220;You have to play to win&#8221;, and if you don&#8217;t ask for comments, especially at the beginning, you shouldn&#8217;t expect to get any.</p>

<p>Do you have any thoughts on improving posts?</p>

<p>Can you point us at anyone who engages you, whether they use these tips or others?</p>
