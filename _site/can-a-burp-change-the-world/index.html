<p><em>Image From: Yertle the Turtle, Dr. Seuss</em></p>

<p>A couple weeks back, I had the pleasure of attending the <a href="http://www.bcorporation.net/2013-champions-retreat">B Corp Champions Retreat</a> in Boulder, Colorado. It was a gathering of 250 people from around the world who are proud to be <a href="http://www.bcorporation.net/">B Corp certified.</a> We came together to address how we can advance the <a href="http://www.bcorporation.net/">B Corp movement</a> by making business as a force for good the* rule*, rather than the exception.</p>

<p>During a conversation about leading a movement, someone in the room made reference to Gandhi&#8217;s term <em>Satyagraha</em> which they loosely translated into &#8220;Soul Power.&#8221; I immediately jotted the phrase in my book. &#8220;Soul Power.&#8221; Ooh it sounded more like James Brown than Mahatma Gandhi. I had to look this up.</p>

<p>Turns out the expression &#8220;Soul Power&#8221; is an English translation of Ghandi&#8217;s term Satyagraha which is a blend of the sanskrit terms <em>Satya</em> (Truth) and <em>Agraha</em> (Force). From what I can glean, Ghandi developed the term to express his belief that the world rests on a bedrock of truth that always prevails (in the long run). The way to spread truth is by building human connection thereby awakening the humanity in others. Truth prevails when one resists meeting the opponent&#8217;s violence with violence, and instead transforms others by exposing our common humanity and our common cause.</p>

<p>Stay with me now&#8230;.</p>

<p>This week I revisited Dr. Seuss&#8217; for a client-project and revisited Seuss&#8217; story Yertle the Turtle.</p>

<p>Yertle, a cruel turtle-ruler, builds a higher and higher throne by stepping on turtles. As Yertle&#8217;s view grows, so does his empire. Mack, the turtle at the bottom of the pile, is meanwhile being slowly crushed by all of the other turtles. Mack protests:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Your Majesty, please&#8230;I don&#8217;t like to complain,</p>

<p>But down here below, we are feeling great pain.</p>

<p>I know, up on top you are seeing great sights,</p>

<p>But down at the bottom, we too should have rights.</p>

<p>We turtles can&#8217;t stand it. Our shells will all crack.</p>

<p>Besides, we need food. We are starving!&#8221; groaned Mack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the end (spoiler alert) Mack topples the king with the simplest act. He <em>burps,</em> &#8220;And his burp shook the throne of the king.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And today the great Yertle, that Marvelous he,</p>

<p>Is King of the Mud. That is all he can see.</p>

<p>And the turtles, of course&#8230;.all the turtles are free</p>

<p>As turtles and, maybe, all creatures should be</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s not inconsequential that the simplest act of humanity (well, his amhibianity), a <em>burp</em>, is what topples the King and his empire.</p>

<p>The truth-force of a turtle burp is so powerful that it ends the rule of a debased, cruel leader.</p>

<p>Being a B Corp is a burp that can shake the world. Creating a business that doesn&#8217;t harm employees, our community and the environment just makes sense&#8211;on a human level. In Ghandi&#8217;s terms, it rests on a &#8220;bedrock of truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>B Corps are creating a movement by living these values and building them into the core of our businesses. We believe that by being B Corps, and living these values in our core, we are able to make these ideas spread to even the most debased corporations (well, maybe not Monsanto). In the grand scheme of things, it may be a burp, but it&#8217;s a burp that can change the world.</p>

<p>Being a B Corps calls to our inner humanity, to see things not as they currently are (false-reality) but to see things as they must be for us all to continue to live and thrive on this tiny home we call earth.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re proud to burp the change, and hope all of our clients, suppliers and friends will burp along with us. After all, it worked for Mack.</p>
