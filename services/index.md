At heart, we&#8217;re a User Experience Design shop. Before anything else, we think about the people who need to notice, interact with and be influenced by the things we make.

Sometimes, our clients come to us with clear ideas about why what they&#8217;re doing matters. More often, we help them get objective perspective so we can be sure we&#8217;re being set up to solve the right problem.

We thrive on getting involved at the research, strategy, design or development stage. And people typically come to us for:

#### Brand Strategy

A clear rationale for strategic and tactical decisions is a powerful tool. But that&#8217;s not where the value of a brand strategy ends. A good brand strategy makes it easier for all members of an organization (and your extended network) to represent you and helps you become more visible to the right peers, prospects and partners.

*   Bell
*   [Chocosol][1]

#### User Experience Design (UX)

Whether you&#8217;re starting out or reconsidering existing digital touch-points, it can be hard to identify, prioritize and set yourself up to serve your audience&#8217;s needs over your organizational needs. But the two shouldn&#8217;t be in conflictâ€“together, they make up the first element of user-experience design.

*See what we did for:*

*   [The MaRS Centre for Impact Investing][2]
*   [Cabot Cooperative][3]

#### Data visualization

Too many important research reports and their insights are designed to be locked away in file cabinets. Bringing your data to life through infographics and interactive experiences makes the data more approachable, shareable and share-worthy.

*See what we did for:*

*   The Toronto Food Policy Council
*   [The International Fund for Animal Welfare][4]
*   Toronto Public Health: Food Strategy
*   [My Sustainable Canada/The Ontario Apple Growers Association][5]

#### **Performance oriented code**

Coding for performance means coding in a way that makes it easier for search engines to process your site, for developers to work on it and for servers to load it.
