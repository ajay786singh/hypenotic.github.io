We all try to do a little bit better here and there. Buy more local in season. Find more local designers or buy more thrift instead of the increasingly affordable and available fast-fashion. And that&#8217;s amazingâ€“the more people who do a bit better, the sooner our ice-caps will stop falling into the ocean.

But what if every single thing you did was crafted to create maximum holistic returns? What if you _only_ did things that could create positive returns, and only when you were ready to do them well? What if this was how you ran your business?

Chocosol transcends &#8216;corporate social responsibility&#8217;. They go deeper than social entrepreneurship.

They&#8217;re a for-profit learning community exploring the answers to those questions through chocolate, cacao and tortillas.

Their mission: maximum positive impact at every stage of their supply chain/value chain.

Strategies: sell healthy delicious food, learn, co-create, teach, nourish, innovate, celebrate

Tactics: horizontal-trade, blend tradition with technology, create community, modularize and open-source

There is no modern metaphor for Chocosol&#8217;s modus operandi. They mash up ancient Meso-American traditions with modern sensibilities to create something new. A mental-model that defies most of our ideas about how businesses should operate. Getting the story across in a nutshell wasn&#8217;t going to happen.

So we didn&#8217;t. Instead, we use their packaging to help people re-think what it is they&#8217;re looking at and hopefully buying. We make the packaging the first soft volley in what will hopefully become a long, infectious conversation.
