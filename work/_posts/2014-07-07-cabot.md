Cabot Creamery is a (fellow B Corp) cooperative. 1,200 farm families located throughout upstate New York and New England. They&#8217;re recognized across the US and take serious pride in their product, processes and people.

Cabot manages four plants in three states and employs over 1,000 people. They&#8217;re loved for their award-winning cheeses, premium butter and cheddars. They also make specialty items like Greek-Style Yogurt, cottage cheese and sour cream.

Our first project together was an exploration of how we might revise the heart of their website, their Virtual Farm Tours. Six months later, Cabot commissioned us to put our ideas into practice.

Cabot had amazing assets, including beautiful photography and interesting profiles of each owner. It was a no-brainer to put these front and centre. We also convinced them to reduce distractions–including the navigation, which wasn’t easy.

Launched in October 2013, we made several progressive design decisions. Major shifts a responsive design, full-screen photography and a focus on the reading experience. We achieved the latter through large type surrounded by plenty of negative space.

Another way we cut down on distractions was by replacing the navigation with an off-canvas menu. This took some back-and-forth, until Jen Neary (Director of Marketing, Integrated Services) said:

> “….okay, I think you’ve brainwashed us”.

Cabot timed the launch of The Virtual Farm Tours section of their site to coincide with their annual “Open Farms Sunday” event. For the special day, we included a pop-up announcement that was removed after the event.
