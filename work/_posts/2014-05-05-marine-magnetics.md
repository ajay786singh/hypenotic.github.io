In 1998, a young engineer saw an opportunity to change the game.

He started Marine Magnetics to bring user experience and the realities his clients and products would face in the field into his product design. He created magnetometers rugged enough to be dragged along the bottom of the sea and sensitive enough to detect the difference between “noise” and meaningful data.

But established niche industries are made up of networks who have thrived during their status quo and are understandably leery of new ideas. Especially better ones.

#### Research: What’s the conversation?

Our research revealed that this market was ripe for a player with new thinking:

*   Marine Magnetics’ competitors’ communications were riddled with engineer thinking and language. They were uniformly painful to look at and even more painful to understand
*   Communications focused on features, not benefits leaving consumers unclear whether sophisticated technology would render better results
*   Years of industry inertia had trained many consumers to expect little in the way of progress or technological innovation. Development stagnated.
*   Competitors deliberately attempted to confuse prospects by pointing out improvement to their products that didn’t affect data collection capabilities. As a result, consumers didn’t understand what data was most valuable in assessing a magnetometer’s performance.

When we researched Marine Magnetics’ approach we saw something completely different:

*   Marine has a design sensibility from conception to development. They don’t fetishize equipment, they make equipment people can use
*   Unlike many other magnetometer manufacturers, Marine ONLY designs marine magnetometers (Doing it right requires focus)
*   Marine has a feedback loop in place that constantly informs the design process. They diligently test their products and incorporate consumer feedback at every stage of development
*   10 years in business still makes Marine a young company with new thinking. This is the kind of issue we can turn into an opportunity
*   The industry’s penchant for obfuscation makes it difficult for prospects to focus on the metrics that matter. Conversely, Marine is all for educating prospects and partners on the science behind their tools

#### Strategy: How can we influence the conversation?

The industry needed an expert, and we decided to give them one. The direction would influence Marine’s look and voice.

The courage to leave plenty of white space suggests the confidence of an organization with something valuable to offer-and one with nothing to hide.

The voice speaks plainly and colloquially about sophisticated technology and design. The object is to make it easier for prospects to make informed decisions about their purchases. Ideally to be in a position to explain the value to others.
