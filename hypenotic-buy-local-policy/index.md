### Premise

Buying local goods isn&#8217;t just neighbourly nepotism, it stimulates local economies.

### Background

A lot of what we do happens online. It&#8217;s not critical that we see our clients (or each other) in person often, it doesn&#8217;t matter where we do our work from and we don&#8217;t purchase many hard goods for use or resale.

This abstraction makes it particularly important for us to be deliberate about the products we do buy.

Products purchased from further away come with direct economic and environmental costs. From an environmental perspective, cargo ships that transport these products use low-grade fuel and are some of the largest contributors of greenhouse gases on our planet.

Businesses run by owners with a stake in their communities create long term social and economic returns that make more fiscal sense than looking for a deal on something made by someone far away.

Our goal is to support entrepreneurs and organizations who support their regions. When products can&#8217;t be found locally, we’ll try to find companies a little further before considering products made overseas. Inevitably, you’ll notice us using things like technology that are core to our business model, made far far away. We do our best when we can!

We&#8217;re not self-righteous about it and we promise never to argue with you about your choices–we just hope people try to look to the options available in their regions before succumbing to the lure of cheap and convenient.
