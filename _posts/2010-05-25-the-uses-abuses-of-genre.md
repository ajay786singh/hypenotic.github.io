An invitation to a [very appetizing event][1] featuring local food described in loving detail: &#8220;Be tantalized by the aroma of grilling steaks and chops from Cumbrae’s while savouring fine wines and beers from local vineyards and microbreweries.&#8221;

At the bottom of the page it reads &#8220;We t*hankfully acknowledge* our fabulous local producers&#8221; with a list of event sponsors. The juxtaposition between the first and second parts of that sentence strikes me, and not just for its [grammatical awkwardness][2]. Why the sudden default to &#8220;event speak&#8221; with &#8220;thankfully acknowledge&#8221;? Especially in the context of so much other beautiful prose. Why not just say &#8220;The incredible local food you&#8217;ll be enjoying was donated by a bunch of generous Ontario local producers listed below.&#8221;

Why do we feel the need to revert of stuffy formalities in certain circumstances?

[Encyclopedia of an Ordinary Life][3] is Amy Krouse Rosenthal&#8217;s version of memoir, written in encyclopedic form. Read her entry under [&#8216;C&#8217; for Clapping][4] and see how funny this innovative format can be. It turns the genre of memoir inside out. [The Village Voice][5] says &#8220;taking the name of a genre obsessed with fixed knowledge, Rosenthal time and again pokes holes in the sober format.&#8221; Why not use a tired dying genre and repurpose it to tell your own story? Why revert to &#8220;we thankfully acknowledge&#8221; when there so many more meaningful ways to express oneself?

The metaphor extends right down to a &#8220;model suite&#8221; you can visit on the Queen Street Site.

The metaphor is a fitting one, since, as CAMH President and CEO says:

> “It’s about lifestyle, and dignified human surroundings for people with mental illness and addiction. It’s also about the city building aspect of what we’re doing – it’s really a new kind of hospital. It is very much a part of the community, and the community is part of it, which is something that hasn’t happened nearly enough in the world of mental illness and addiction.” ([NOW Magazine][9])

The PSA genre, heavy with stories and serious issues gets a refreshing new life in the form of a new genre. The digital campaign is less bold in it&#8217;s departure from traditional PSA, reverting to stories and not taking the idea as far as it could. But, a noble effort nonetheless.
