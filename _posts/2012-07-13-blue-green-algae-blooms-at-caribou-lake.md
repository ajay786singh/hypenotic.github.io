Caribou Lake, near Sault St. Marie in Algoma has a blue-green menace in its midst. Blooming blue green algae has kept people from swimming, fishing and using water from their wells since 2010. It&#8217;s a total bummer.

The algae blooms were partly caused by farmers, citizens and cottagers whose habits have caused &#8220;nutrient loading,&#8221; or an overload of phosphorous and nitrogen in the water.

Want to keep blue-green algae out of your lake? Here&#8217;s information outlining what you need to know;

1.  Don&#8217;t use conventional, chemical loaded lawn and garden fertilizers
2.  Keep your shoreline green
3.  Don&#8217;t let conventional soaps and shampoos get into the lake during bathing, dishwashing, laundry, and cleaning
4.  Inspect your septic tanks, outhouses etc. to make sure they are working properly
