My bath brush has a story. When I douse it in [Dr. Bronner&#8217;s ][1]soap and buff myself silly, I think of this story.

I bought the brush at [Mjolk][2] in the Junction which specializes in Scandinavian design. It was made by Stockholm based  [Iris Handverk][3] using the same traditions–including the employment of visually impaired people to make the oak and horse hair brushes by hand–they&#8217;ve used since the 1800&#8242;s.

According to Mjolk&#8217;s owner, John Baker, who visited the factory, the brush factory is a pretty mystical space where everything happens in the dark as visually impaired workers work by touch. Brings a whole new meaning to the expression &#8220;handmade.&#8221;

This professionally produced video does an incredible job of showing the process required to make each hand-rendered brush. But it does more. It also mimics the experience of holding one of those gorgeous brushes in your hand.

&nbsp;



The video&#8217;s sensuality turns something as mundane as a scrub brush into an artistic and mystical experience.

There&#8217;s no fetishizing of the workers&#8217; visual impairment. It&#8217;s quietly suggested and respectfully rendered. It&#8217;s about the presence of well-worn hands, not the absence of sight. Which is what you&#8217;d expect from a company that is an offshoot of a [Foundation for the Blind][4] with a range of other social venture projects.

It&#8217;s what you&#8217;d expect from a company that makes brushes to suit every purpose you can imagine for [kitchens, ][5][bathrooms, ][6][shoes][7], [outdoors][8] and [cleaning][9]. They also carry brushes [available only by request.][10]

As much as we advocate that everyone should get themselves a [Flip][11] and use it, there&#8217;s a valuable place for professionally made video. And a place for artistic vision. Perhaps most importantly, there needs to be time and space to consider how a video can enhance the experience and enrich the story.

Sure the video could be shorter. But so could [War and Peace.][12]
