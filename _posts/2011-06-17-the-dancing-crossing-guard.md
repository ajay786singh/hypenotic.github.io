The opening of the Dufferin underpass shone a light on one of the most inspiring people we’ve had the chance to meet. Kathleen, the dancing crossing guard at Dufferin and Dundas gleefully dances as she ushers students, moms with strollers and folks from all walks of life across the road. She dances three hours a day, five days a week.

Meeting Kathleen brought to mind Sir Ken Robinson’s (first) [TED Talk][1] which questions whether &#8220;schools kill creativity&#8221; and more broadly, why society favours certain behaviours over others. Particularly the story of a young ballerina asks an important question:

> “There isn’t an education on the planet that teaches dance every day to children the way we teach them mathematics. Why? Why Not?”

Kathleen has figured out that she can’t sit still. For some, that would be considered a problem, possibly even one requiring treatment. Thank goodness she remains untreated. Kathleen’s ability to tap into her natural kinesthetic inclination means that she can shine a light on the little corner of the world where she dances and helps people cross the road.

As you&#8217;ll learn from the video, a few simple behaviours that don&#8217;t fit into corporate life help Kathleen find her own way to a fulfilling (and healthy) existence.
