Thanks for voting. We were rather blown-away by the response.

Without further ado, here&#8217;s the winning [Beau&#8217;s Beer][1] Bottle cap design. It&#8217;s only a simulation, this is only a test&#8211;but keep reading &#8217;cause there&#8217;s much more to the story below.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-5373" href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/5328/beaus-beer-being-the-difference/attachment/screen-shot-2011-05-25-at-3-52-45-pm"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5373" title="Screen shot 2011-05-25 at 3.52.45 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-25-at-3.52.45-PM.png" alt="" width="477" height="417" /></a>

Sure, the bottle cap is cute (it *does* feature my husband afterall),  but it&#8217;s Beau&#8217;s inspired idea for a silent auction item that really has me swooning.

Most charity events follow a formula that generally includes an auction. Whether silent or in some cases, very very loud, volunteers work tirelessly to collect items from generous businesses to raise money for worthy causes. All good so far.

The trouble is that once anything becomes formulaic its impact is diminished. What&#8217;s generic gets ignored. And that impacts dollars raised and profile for the organization behind the donation and the beneficiary.

By offering the auction winner their face on 100,000 Beer Caps, Beau&#8217;s got the bidding high (raising much needed funds for [Not Far From the Tree][2]) and drew attention to both Beau&#8217;s and NFFTT. It was being talked about online before the[ Brewer&#8217;s Plate][3] even began.

I asked Beau&#8217;s Creative Director Jordan why Beau&#8217;s opted for such a creative take on the silent auction formula.

His response shows how much organizations benefit from knowing what they stand for and committing to it in everything they do. Beau&#8217;s brand platform is built on six key pillars:

*   Local
*   Family Run
*   Totally DIY
*   Award Winning
*   Tasty Beers
*   Certified Organic

In Beau&#8217;s case, the zany silent auction item is a mashup between two of these key pillars&#8211;a commitment to supporting their local community and their passion for being &#8220;Totally DIY.&#8221; The DIY dimension comes from their beginnings in the punk movement and indie musicians. They describe this as:

> Beau&#8217;s has taken great inspiration from these hard-working artists who learned that great talent can still get noticed in a tough market that is dominated by multinational competitors.

In other words, Beau&#8217;s has a commitment to zagging when everyone else zigs. But it&#8217;s not just for the sake of being different. Their DIY ethic means they can figure out how to do a relatively short run of bottle caps with someone&#8217;s face on &#8216;em. I&#8217;d like to be a fly on the wall during a Labatt meeting where they talk through the logistics of an idea like this. Those executives would be frothing.

On the other hand, the auction item gives Beau&#8217;s an opportunity to leverage the fact that they&#8217;re small and nimble as an advantage over the &#8216;big guys.&#8217;

Last year, Beau&#8217;s raised $100,000 for a range of charitable organizations, $30,000 of which came from their massive [Oktoberfest event][4] held near Ottawa every year. They threw the community a party and over 7,000 people came out to eat drink and dance last year. This is no small feat.

And, guess which bottle cap will be ready just in time for this big event? I bet Barry&#8217;ll look great in lederhosen.
