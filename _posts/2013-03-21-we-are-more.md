B.C. poet [Shane Koyczan][1] was bullied a lot when he was a kid, which is something many of us can relate to. He, along with some extremely talented people, have created 7.5 breathtaking minutes describing the lasting effects bullying has on the lives of children and adults alike. The video—posted on February 19th—has more than 1.1 million hits and thousands upon thousands of comments.

> My experiences with violence in schools still echo throughout my life but standing to face the problem has helped me in immeasurable ways. -Shane Koyczan

The project, [To This Day][2], aims to provide a message that will have a long-lasting effect in confronting bullying. You can help the effort [here][3], and by sharing the message with as many people as possible.
