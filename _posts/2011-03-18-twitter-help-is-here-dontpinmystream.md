The &#8220;[Don&#8217;t P in my Stream][1]&#8221; project is a public service intended to:

*   Help twitter newbies jump to the head of the class
*   Preserve the twitter ecosystem
*   Be useful to seasoned users

More than a little inspired by Merlin Mann&#8217;s [ThanksNo][2] project from a few years ago that was a boon in the early days of email overload, if the project can be a fraction as useful as ThanksNo has been, it will be worth it. Hell, if it gets used at all we&#8217;ll be impressed.

The truth is we&#8217;ve met clients, employees, partners and peers on twitter and we love it. It&#8217;s been an amazing journey from our first tepid tweets, wrestling our way up the learning curve of a mountain thats shape is evolving  underneath us to a resource we&#8217;re quite literally addicted to.

On the page, we listed a few twitter basics to avoid like:

*   Tweeting inanity (in an era of info-overload, ‘self-filtering’ is essential)
*   Promoting your company/organization/client (This is communications dept, not sales)
*   Telling us where you are or what you’re doing instead of why it matters (be useful please)
*   #hashtagging the #hell out of #the #tweet (you’re fostering # blindness)
*   Tweeting too many times in a short period (clogs up our stream w/your avatar)

But there are invariably more out there like:

*   Mindless retweets (Without reading the link)
*   Group #FFs (It&#8217;s generally better to say something informative about an individual)
*   Group #FF Retweets (that&#8217;s a bit lazy, no?)
*   Personal conversations in public (Overdoing it comes across as a bit needy, don&#8217;t you think?)

So do feel free to add your pet peeve in the comments or via twitter.

And conversely, do feel free to make a case for a particular behaviour if you&#8217;re so inclined.

So, if you want to politely suggest that someone you follow should avoid certain twitter behaviours, [send them to this handy page][3], and let them know you care enough to tell them like it is.
