It&#8217;s a ride where you never know what&#8217;s around the corner, but that&#8217;s the whole idea.

This great Slalom-cam video of shot on Crowe Lake in the Kawarthas makes me think that life is also a lot like slalom waterskiing on Crowe lake. If you&#8217;re anything like me, waterskiing (on two skis never mind one) is both exhilarating and terrifying. If you do it on one ski, it&#8217;s all those things to the power of ten.

Watching this video makes my stomach muscles tense up and puts a smile on my face. Feels like how most of my days go down. What does it do for you? Is life like slalom waterskiing? a waterslide? a box of chocolates? a colonoscopy?
