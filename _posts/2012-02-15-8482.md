It seems like forever ago that I first set foot in Hypenotic, a little third year student looking for a three-week internship. That short internship was extended into a part-time and then full-time job, and what I found was an amazing place to work and learn, with people who really love what they’re doing. But it’s time to spread my wings, hop out of the Hypenotic nest, and head out into the big scary world.

I’d like to share a few tidbits on what it’s like to work at Hypenotic.

#### You know you work at Hypenotic when&#8230;

*   You’ve napped on the green couch, and had your picture taken while sleeping.
*   The topic of coffee (cutting down on coffee/quitting coffee/coming back to coffee/how to make the best coffee) comes up often.
*   Your day is ruined by the words, “there’s no milk”.
*   You encourage each other to be healthy. Everyone is involved in some form of physical activity, be it yoga, biking, dog-walking, or afternoon dance parties.
*   You&#8217;ve learned about some exciting new dance/exercise routines via live demonstrations from Jodi.
*   You know more about local sustainable food than you ever did before, and make much more of an effort to eat well.
*   It is almost expected that when you announce you are going for a walk, you should come back with some kind of treat.
*   You’re always too hot or too cold.
*   You find strange and mysterious objects in your desk&#8230; like a surplus of flip-flops.
*   You’ve worn the office hoodie.
*   You know what “B5” means. You may have ordered it many, many times.
*   “What’s everyone doing for lunch?” is something you hear a lot, as well as, “Can you just get me a B5?”.
*   You buy cupcakes for yourself on someone else’s birthday.
*   You get home and find a doggy poop bag in your pocket.

I’ve learned so much here, and have enjoyed working with such wonderful people, but the time has come for me to move on to new adventures. I’ll miss you guys. I’ll miss the beautiful sunny office. I’ll miss the coffee. And Blue, I think I’ll miss you most of all. You stay cute, office puppy. Thanks for everything guys, I hope to see you all soon!
