</p>

[Maplelea Girls][1], a line of Canadian-themed dolls for girls is the (way better) Canadian version of [American Girl][2]. Their latest doll is [Salia][3] from Iqaluit the capital of Nunavat.

Beyond the dolls, Maplelea has a customer experience program that is sheer brilliance. It&#8217;s called the [spa program][4] and it goes like this. If misfortune befalls your Maplelea doll, you just send her to the spa:

*   Fill out a [spa admission form][5] and undress her
*   Ship her back to Maplelea
*   Pay a doll replacement fee (which includes shipping)
*   Get a brand new doll (that you paid for) sent to you dressed in a fluffy terry cloth robe and slippers

<div>
  I&#8217;m guessing the reason that Maplelea adopted this clever service was to avoid parents having to tell their little girls (who dearly love their dolls) that their BFF needs to take a one way trip to the dumpster. Saying the doll&#8217;s simply getting a little bit of primping at the spa is so much easier. And it works for Maplelea who makes it easier for parents to purchase another doll.
</div>

<div>
  I vividly remember when my daughter left her Elmo doll at the community centre. I couldn&#8217;t get a replacement fast enough. And of course I had to be very creative in explaining where Elmo had been for the past few days (he was at a casino in Aruba).
</div>

<div>
  Think about how Maplelea&#8217;s customer service approach could be applied to other areas where people are either loathe to part with an object or hate the idea of paying a replacement fee. This spa approach would soften the blow if you needed to replace:
</div>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Your cracked iphone
    </li>
    <li>
      Your broken sun glasses
    </li>
    <li>
      Your bike
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Just imagine how adorable your iphone would look snuggled up in a tiny bath robe?
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  On one level I&#8217;m of course jesting. But I&#8217;m very serious about the thinking behind this program.
</div>

<div>
  When designing customer experience initiatives, ask yourself:
</div>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      What do you know about your customers that could help them when they most need it?
    </li>
    <li>
      What could you do to ease a problem your customers are having&#8211;even if it has nothing to do with the quality of your product?
    </li>
    <li>
      How can you make something painful (like getting a replacement) more fun, interesting and engaging to engender greater customer  loyalty?
    </li>
  </ul>
