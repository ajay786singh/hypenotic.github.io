Â Most of the folks we work with are conscious consumers to the degree that they&#8217;re comfortable with. Food is an area that I&#8217;ve been able to make major changes to my consumption habits in. In fact it was the account of the fast food industry&#8217;s labour practices in Eric Schlosser&#8217;s <a class="zem_slink" title="Fast Food Nation" href="http://www.amazon.com/Fast-Food-Nation-Eric-Schlosser/dp/0395977894%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dhypenoticcom-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0395977894" rel="amazon">Fast Food Nation</a> that made it easy to drop them off my menu.

The Slavery Footprint (beautifully and) disarmingly helps you get your head around how many of your comforts, conveniences and distractions make you complicit in slavery.

Accuracy aside, one thing was clear from the well illustrated walk-through. The degree of learning we all have to do is only dwarfed by the changes we need to make. The entities that make their margins on the backs of slaves count on our dependence on maintaining the status quo. Inertia is dangerous.

PS: There&#8217;s an app for it too.
