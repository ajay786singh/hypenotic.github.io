<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1843" title="Screen shot 2010-02-01 at 11.40.41 AM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Screen-shot-2010-02-01-at-11.40.41-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2010-02-01 at 11.40.41 AM" width="307" height="362" />What is the magical mix of elements that makes thrifting such an exciting pastime? Why do I find myself turning my steering wheel toward [Value Village ][1]when I&#8217;m supposed to be going to the gym? Why do my friend and I give Olympic worthy-focus to scouring tiny thrift shops tucked into Buffalo church basements&#8211;so much so that we&#8217;re content to eat our lunches in the car en route to the next stop?

If someone could bottle the thrill of thrifting, they could make a fortune. Value Village has literally hitched it&#8217;s wagon to the thrifting-set. While VV is *not *owned by Walmart (a nasty rumour) it is owned by [Savers][2], a 200+ for-profit American chain that is owned by the private equity investment firm of [Freeman Spogli and Company.][3] And, obviously [ebay][4] and [craigslist ][5]understand, and benefit from, the psychology of thrifting.

What is the unique *Eau De Thrift? *Can it be bottled and reproduced in other shopping experiences? * *Well, not literally. If you&#8217;ve ever walked into a thrift store there&#8217;s a distinct odour that hits you at the door. For me it&#8217;s like a welcome mat. But I wouldn&#8217;t call it pleasant.

What is the psychology of thrifting that makes it so appealing? Here&#8217;s my preliminary list:

*   **It&#8217;s Meditative:** Flipping through racks of random objects is downright meditative. Bill and Susan&#8217;s 10th Anniversary mug is stationed right beside a valuable Wedgewood tea cup.  And there&#8217;s no price-tag guilt to distract you from your zen-like state. The only thing to focus on is; Do I like it? Can I use it? (or can my friend use it?)
*   **There&#8217;s the Thrill of the find: **In her article [The Psychology of Thrifting ][6]Beth Wechsler says &#8220;It&#8217;s no different than the bell that rings when the slot machine lines up just right and the coins come scrambling down.&#8221; And once you&#8217;ve scored a find, you&#8217;re entitled to bragging rights (you: nice sweater! me: Thanks. $5 bucks at Value Village)
*   **Nostalgia: **Like [Proust&#8217;s Madeleine,][7] there are memories embedded in those objects. Even if they&#8217;re not my memories, these objects came from somewhere and carry a story. That tiny wall mount soap dish I found in Buffalo? I&#8217;m fascinated with who owned it (was it a little old lady? a hotel?) It&#8217;s pre-owed status just adds to it&#8217;s appeal.
*   **Doing-Good: **Thrifting doesn&#8217;t hurt your pocketbook or the world. There&#8217;s really nothing to feel bad about to get in the way of all the good stuff. The objects are pre-used so no new resources went into making them. It&#8217;s recycling. And, many thrift stores are not-for-profit. [Goodwill][8], [Salvation Army][9] (we pros call Sally-Ann) are their own non-profit organizations, while other thrift shops donate all their money to charitable causes like AIDS, abused women, etc.

Several retail stores have created shopping experiences that try to mimic some aspects of the thrifting experience. But few can replicate the entire psychological experience without selling actual thrift items.

*   **Meditative:** [Urban Outfitters][10]&#8216; and [Anthropologie][11]&#8216;s eclectic offerings ([Squirrel and Fox Wall Art][12] anyone?) are made for people who like to search through gobs of stuff to find a prize. But that prize won&#8217;t be cheap, and it won&#8217;t feel good.
*   **Thrill of the Find: **Obviously places like [Walmart ][13]or [Winners][14] offer bargains that can make your head spin and give you bragging rights. But, again, they have that Made in China feeling that is a definite buzz kill.

> Very, very few retailers can offer two essential ingredients to thrifting ; Nostalgia and Doing-good. Despite best efforts, these products always feel like empty commodities mass manufactured in China.

**Tracking Down the Scent: Kiosk Kiosk**

One shop that comes closest to capturing the magical *Eau de Thrifting* is New York based [KioskKiosk][15]. Kiosk Kiosk&#8217;s website offers an eclectic bunch of finds from a given country for a limited period of time. And then, they move to the next country. So, like thrifting the opportunity is time-sensitive. Right now they&#8217;re featuring Portugal on their site. And, as someone who lives in Toronto&#8217;s Little Portugal, I can tell you, it&#8217;s a pretty wacky place.

Among the items currently on the site is a g[oat toothpick holder][16], [donkey playing cards, ][17] [wood glue][18],  and[ tinned fish][19]. It&#8217;s not just the objects on the site that create this effect. It&#8217;s how they are presented. They use courier font, only show one object in totally random order (there are no product catagories) and every object is photographed in a unique and often bizarre setting. The let&#8217;s run Kiosk Kiosk through our *Eau de Thrifting *checklist, shall we?

*   **Meditative? **Check. The utter randomness of objects on the site will leave you mezmerized. As you flip through the web page, each object is transformed from a kalidesope-esque image into a photograph. This is clearly deliberate
*   **Thrill of the Find? **Check. Where else would you find such a random range of objects in one place? And most items are well under $50.
*   **Nostalgia? **Check. Even though these items are new, they do carry an aura with them. It is the aura of another culture. Of someone&#8217;s grandmother, but it&#8217;s an aura nonetheless.
*   **Do-Good? **Well&#8230;.. I realize that some of these objects may be made in far away places that are not Portugal (perhaps China, but I don&#8217;t think so). I realize they are not pre-loved by other human beings that would qualify their purchase as recycling. Their purchase does not raise money for people in need. But, this is about *perception* people. The authenticity of these exotic objects keeps them from feeling like commodities. I say &#8216;check.

Are there any spots you think qualify for the *Eau de Thrifting*? I&#8217;d love to hear about them. Or, even better, great Thrift stores in Toronto, Buffalo or well&#8230;.no more than 2 hours drive. 2 hours is reasonable to go for an experience like this.
