While exploring the Ottawa River, French explorer [Samuel de Champlain][1] canoed across a series of lakes that came to be known as the Champlain Trail Lakes. He was a pretty swell guy, attempting to make better relations with local native tribes, as well as establishing the French settlement which we now know as [Quebec City][2]. He was also the first European to fully explore and describe the [Great Lakes][3] by creating maps and accounts of what he had learned.

> It is this art (navigation) that drew me to love the sea at a very young age and that compelled me to challenge its treacherous waters all of my life and that made me navigate and follow the coast of parts of America . . . &#8211; Samuel de Champlain
