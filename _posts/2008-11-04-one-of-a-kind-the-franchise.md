[][1]Saw a giant billboard on the side of a bus for the Christmas <a title="oneofakind" href="http://www.oneofakindshow.com/" target="_blank">One of A Kind Show</a>. With a huge local movement afoot, it&#8217;s hard for a huge empire like One of A Kind to feel authentic. Even if you didn&#8217;t know that it&#8217;s owned by [Merchandise Mart Properties Inc. ][2]in Chicago you would notice the horrible crowds, the overpriced tickets and the bad crafts (because the booths are so expensive, real crafts people can&#8217;t afford to go.)

This holiday season, there are reams of truly local craft shows that support local artists. This one at the [Gladstone][3] caught my eye. 

With a strong local movement afoot, it&#8217;ll be a challenge for One of a Kind to keep a foothold in this market. Want to know how to do it well? Just ask [Etsy][4]. They are all about helping craftspeople do their job well. They do everything in their power to help them market themselves better. They have a[ whole community section][5] dedicated to craftspeople.

Sure, you can be big and small at the same time. You just gotta be smart.
