  What would you say if I told you that you could go <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portage">portaging</a> with your motor boat? You would probably think I&#8217;m crazy. After all, who wants to pick up a heavy motor boat and carry it around? Well, according to <a href="http://www.clearwaterlodge.net/">Clearwater Lodge</a> at Clearwater Lake, their mechanical &#8220;roller coaster&#8221; system allows you to gain access to the entire lake system in one easy trip:

>   &#8220;It&#8217;s the mechanical portages that make this lake system what it is, giving the unparalleled access to the entire lake chain. It&#8217;s definitely what makes this lake system unique. As far as we know there is no other lake system that provides this type of mechanical portaging any where else in Ontario.&#8221;

The system was put into place so you can choose wherever you would like to go and fish to your heart&#8217;s content. To the south you&#8217;ll find Walleye, Muskie, Pike and Bass. To the north you&#8217;ve got your Trout.



So if you&#8217;ve always wanted to portage sans canoe, then Clearwater Lodge&#8217;s Roller Coaster Mechanical Portage is for you!
