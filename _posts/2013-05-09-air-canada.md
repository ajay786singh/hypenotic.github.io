I&#8217;ve watched this video by fellow [B Corporation][1] [Free Range Studios ][2]many times. But when I went to their site to send it to a friend yesterday, a Twitter conversation between the studio&#8217;s founder [Jonah Sachs][3] and [Air Canada][4] on the Free Range Studio&#8217;s website caught my attention.

<a href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/10900/air-canada/attachment/screen-shot-2013-05-08-at-1-09-55-pm" rel="attachment wp-att-10903"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10903" alt="Screen shot 2013-05-08 at 1.09.55 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Screen-shot-2013-05-08-at-1.09.55-PM.png" width="517" height="415" /></a>

And I followed the trail to Air Canada&#8217;s responses:

<a href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/10900/air-canada/attachment/screen-shot-2013-05-08-at-1-11-48-pm" rel="attachment wp-att-10902"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10902" alt="Screen shot 2013-05-08 at 1.11.48 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Screen-shot-2013-05-08-at-1.11.48-PM.png" width="534" height="93" /></a>

In The Story Wars, Free Range Studios breaks all myths down into four key components:

1.  <span style="line-height: 13px;">Explanation</span>
2.  Meaning
3.  Story
4.  Ritual

As a fun, end-of-week exercise, I thought I&#8217;d use Free Range Studio&#8217;s own methodology to make sense of Air Canada&#8217;s myth-making in this Twitter exchange.

1.  <span style="line-height: 13px;">Explanation: Air Canada offers a way communicate so we can respond to your flying needs right away</span>
2.  Meaning: We&#8217;ll improve your flying experience
3.  Story: I can connect with a real person who can help me navigate the flying experience
4.  Ritual: I can have a better flying experience with Air Canada

However, this myth crash lands when Air Canada misses the mark, failing to make the system better for this particularly influential traveller. Sachs complains that he was told to mail his receipt for a hotel stay after an Air Canada delay caused him to miss his flight. He tweets asking what Air Canada can do to help? In return they give him the address to mail the receipt in to.

> Imagine you&#8217;re drowning and calling out for help. The lifeguard responds by saying &#8220;just keep swimming&#8221; instead of throwing you a buoy or swimming out to save you. That&#8217;s what Air Canada effectively did.

Air Canada&#8217;s  initial offer to help creates a myth that is quickly dispelled. And  what happens when myths are dispelled? According to The Story Wars, citizens become engaged to &#8220;fight the lies of the dark art&#8221; of marketing.

Citizens raise their voices to express their ire when brands fail to successfully close the gap between myth and reality (called explanation and ritual in the The Story wars and called brand promise and user experience by marketers). Amplicate shows that [78% of people on social media hate Air Canada. ][5]

So what is the moral of the story?

1.  You never know who you&#8217;re pissing off and how much influence they have.
2.  Social media presence creates an opportunity to close the gap between explanation and ritual. If that&#8217;s not your objective, why are you employing someone to manage your brand&#8217;s social media account? Why are you hiring employees to serve customers?
3.  And finally, as we all know, Air Canada really does suck.
