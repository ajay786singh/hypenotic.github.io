Well, it&#8217;s been a blast, but it&#8217;s time to move on. The Art Director is leaving the building.

I&#8217;m not only leaving the building, but the whole complex. As much as I thought that I would be a designer til the day I die {I didn&#8217;t want to be anything else while in high school; I went to York and OCA for design, and I landed my first design job before I even got the chance to graduate}, I&#8217;m now moving in another direction, one toward the erotic. In 2009, I launched [The Keyhole Sessions][1] as a weekly life-drawing class. This quickly expanded into photography Sessions, exhibitions, rogue Nuit Blanche events, and it&#8217;s still growing. I&#8217;ve become an advocate for sexual freedom, dialogue and education, and have created a safe space for people to experiment in the marriage between sex and art. So I&#8217;m going to dive into this community fulltime, as I feel Toronto is hungry for it, and hey, *someone* has to do it.

I learned so much while at Hypenotic. The crew here is truly awesome, and I&#8217;ve never worked with people so passionate about what they&#8217;re doing. This studio really does eat and breathe design and communication. Sounds hokey, but it&#8217;s true. The projects have been inspiring, as have the clients. I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of working with [The Gladstone Hotel][2], [Chocosol][3], [Quince Flowers][4], [Camp Arowhon][5] and [Fiesta Farms][6], just to name a few. All people who are doing great things for their communities, and I&#8217;m proud to have been a part of it.

It&#8217;s rare for people to say that their careers have been satisfying, and I&#8217;m one of the lucky ones. To be able to learn as much as I have, to enjoy the company of my colleagues, to engage with clients on a personal level as well as professional, and to feel like what I&#8217;ve done has made a difference for many is more than I could ask for. I&#8217;m excited for the new team that is assembling at Hypenotic. There&#8217;s an energy that&#8217;s bubbling and any client that passes through the door these days should be quite happy indeed.

So huge props to Barry, Jodi, Rick, Lionel, Sonja, Rebecca, Risa, Erin and Sabrina. All working hard to live up to the Hype. And if you&#8217;re ever in the mood to dip into the saucy side of art, just [gimme a shout][7].
