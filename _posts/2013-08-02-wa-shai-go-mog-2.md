Wa-shai-go-mog is the original name of Fairbank Lake, named by the Ojibwe tribe that lived on the lake banks until the 1930s. Wa-shai-go-mog means &#8220;clear water&#8221;, a fitting name for the oligotrophic lake that is bait for snorkelers and scuba divers every year.  
If you think that&#8217;s interesting, wait until you hear about its past. The lake was allegedly created when a meteor crashed into the earth, leaving a crater now known as Fairbank Lake. How is that for historical impact? And people are still vying for camp sites around its banks today.
