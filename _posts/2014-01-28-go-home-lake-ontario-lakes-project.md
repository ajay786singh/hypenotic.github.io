<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5em;">The Lake You Can&#8217;t Wait To Leave</span>

<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5em;">Go Home Lake, in the tow</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5em;">nship of Georgian Bay, is situated in a hot spot of other lakes and islands with equally simple and informative names. There’s Paradise Bay to the north. Bay Of Many Winds lies to the south, Black Squirrel Island to the west, and the list goes on and on (check out a map </span><a style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://maps.google.ca/maps?q=go+home+lake+ontario&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=0x4d2afb5a2754ee03:0x132e9d9bca11bb22,Go+Home+Lake&gl=ca&ei=FrTFUqyjAqTk2AW374DQBA&ved=0CKkBELYD">here</a><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5em;">!)</span>

These names made me wonder whether they were named for obvious reasons. Turns out, Go Home Lake got its name from the loggers that would ‘go home’ after a long, hard day of sending timber down a connecting river.

Wanting to leave a lake reminded me of a recent experience crashing at a friends lakeside cottage with 16 other people.

> (For those reading who were also there, I had a wonderful time, and being ready to go on the last day should be no reflection of the awesomeness we shared.)

However I’m sure we can all relate, that after a few days of 16 people sharing 6 bedrooms and 1 kitchen, and -30 weather holding introverts hostage in indoors with extroverts, the feeling of going home can sometimes be better than the feeling of going to a lake.

And what are the odds there is a story on the [Onion][1] with this exact theme. I had to share, its a funny and truthful read. Enjoy!

  <em>Its Called Go Home Lake for a Reason<br /> </em>By Paul Benedetti

We were lucky enough to do quite a bit of “cottage surfing” this summer.

Cottage surfing is a lot like what young people call “couch surfing.” Basically, couch surfing is serially crashing at your friends’ apartments while you pretend to try to find your own accommodations. There are stories of students doing this throughout their university years, eventually graduating and buying a house with all the rent money they saved by mooching off their friends.

Cottage surfing is similar except the beds are better and there’s a lot less hair gel and beer pong. Essentially, adult cottage surfing was designed by people who want to enjoy the delights of Canada’s wilderness but are too smart to own their own cottage.

We visited many friends over the summer season in places like Honey Harbour, Lake Rosseau, Barrie’s Bay and the Thousand Islands. All in all, our trips went very well, if you can overlook one small misunderstanding with local law enforcement over some nude wakeboarding.

> (You’re not nude if you’re wearing a hat right?)

When I say our visits went well, it’s only because we have learned to carefully watch for signs that we have overstayed our welcome. It’s pretty tricky stuff. For one thing, it’s hard to catch the nuances of what people are saying to you if you’ve been drinking beers since noon. As well, even without the haze created by a half-dozen Bud Limes, sometimes hosts are not as clear as they should be about the nature of the holiday.

Often, these Why-don’t-you-come-up-and-stay-for-a-while?-style invitations can be problematic. Does that mean a day or two? A long weekend or are we talking a week? It’s hard to know. Hard to know regardless whether you are a visitor or the host. We’ve had problems on both sides of that equation.

For example, we’ve invited people out for a Friday night dinner and sleepover so no one has to worry about driving. Most people enjoy breakfast on Saturday and then spend a few hours chatting before hitting the road. A couple of times though, as we got in our car on Sunday evening to head back to the city from our cottage on Lake Erie, we’ve had people standing on OUR porch waving goodbye, calling out, “Don’t worry, we’ll lock up when we leave.”

I’ve also been on the other end of that scenario, extending my visit by a day and then another and another until I realize one evening that everyone else has left and dinners now consist of the host couple, their aging mother Ethel — and me.

> Awkward moment.

Anyway, there are warning signs that you may be heading into Cottage Visiting Overload. You know it’s time to go when:

• At the breakfast table you start talking about “your room” in the cottage, as in: “You know, I’d like to change the curtains in my room. Maybe something in lime green.”

• You sleep in one morning only to find your duffel bag packed and sitting on the end of the dock.

• You stopped bothering “getting dressed” and just lounge around the cabin unshaven in your bathrobe and bifocals.

• Your hosts have left.

• You’ve cooked the three things you know how to make. Twice.

• You’ve told the three good jokes you know. Twice.

• The little kids start calling you “Uncle.”

• All the other guests have departed. Your hosts mention that they are celebrating their 30th wedding anniversary with a “romantic week” at the cottage. You offer to buy some candles and bake a nice cake.

• You go into your room one night and find a map of Ontario open on your bed with a huge red magic marker line from the cottage back to Hamilton.

Don’t worry if you are embarrassed that you missed some of these signs. (Who among us has not, I ask you?) These are actually quite subtle compared to being escorted down to the boat at dawn and left at the local dock in the rain. Not that that ever happened to me. Well, at least not within the last week.

Funny, I haven’t received any cottage invitations for Thanksgiving. What’s up with that?
