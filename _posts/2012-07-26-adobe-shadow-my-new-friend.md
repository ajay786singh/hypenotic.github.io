I&#8217;ve discovered a new web development friend which I&#8217;d like you to meet. It has eased the pain of viewing and testing websites and apps on various devices. It&#8217;s especially awesome for responsive web development.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9629" title="Adobe Shadow" alt="Adobe Shadow" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/adobeshadow.jpg" width="584" height="296" />

I&#8217;m not one for touting a particular product, but when a small tool helps in a big way and fits in seamlessly with your work process it&#8217;s worth sharing.

Ready&#8230;it&#8217;s name is <a href="http://html.adobe.com/toolsandservices/shadow/" target="_blank">Adobe Shadow</a> and I&#8217;m a fan.

It doesn&#8217;t do a ton of things but what it does do is exactly what I need. Synchronized browsing, screenshots and remotely inspecting your code.

Here&#8217;s the scoop.

1.  Pair multiple Apple iOS and Google Android devices to your computer over a wireless connection. With Shadow, you can browse in Google Chrome and all connected devices will stay in sync.
2.  Take screenshots of the current page from any connected device.
3.  Target a device for remote inspection, make changes to the HTML, CSS and JavaScript using familiar development tools, and see your device update in real time.

The one downside is that it only works with Google Chrome so cross browser testing isn&#8217;t possible but I&#8217;ve heard there is a bunch of stuff in the pipeline so you never know.

It&#8217;s easy to setup.

1.  Just download the Adobe Shadow app onto your device, in my case an iPhone.
2.  Install the Chrome Extension
3.  Install Adobe Shadow on your computer

Testing your pages with Shadow is a breeze. Just browse using Chrome and all devices that have been connected will follow along. This enables you to test the appearance and behavior of any page on a variety of devices at one time. Plus, Shadow will keep your device from going to sleep, so you no longer need to unlock the device when you want to test the page.
