I&#8217;m taking this course through [Coursera][1] entitled [Gamification][2]. Like so many of you, I consider myself a &#8220;gamer.&#8221; Naturally I figured this course would be right up my alley.

Having had the liberty of attending a lecture by [Jane McGonigal][3], I had already been introduced to certain attributes of Gamification. She touched on why games make us better people, and how they can in fact change the world. Needless to say, I quickly developed an understanding of why we need to make time to play in our busy lives.

Gamification itself is a fairly new concept that is growing at an exponential rate. It&#8217;s not all [Goombas][4] and [Projectiles][5] like some of you may think. In fact, it&#8217;s a sophisticated psychological take on how we interact with the world around us.

It&#8217;s a well-thought-out combination of Game Elements, Techniques and Designs that are strategically placed in non-game applications and processes. The end result is a more engaging and effective learning experience. You also get [points][6]. People like points.

There are, in fact 3 categories to Gamification: External (marketing, sales, customer engagement), Internal (Productivity, Crowdsourcing), and my personal favourite, Behavioural Change (health and wellness, sustainability, and personal finance).

Back in 2010, [Volkswagen][7] held a Competition (note the External Game Element in a Marketing setting) called [The Fun Theory][8]. The purpose was to come up with something &#8220;fun&#8221; that would make a positive change. The winner, Kevin Richardson, developed the Speed Camera Lottery to make a positive change in traffic safety. His idea was so good, that Volkswagen, together with [The Swedish National Society for Road Safety][9], actually made this innovative idea a reality in Stockholm, Sweden. During a 3-day period, the overall driving speed dropped by 22%.

&nbsp;

Both Volkswagen and Kevin used various Game-like Elements to engage people, getting them to make a positive change in their behaviour, which in turn mades the roads safer for everyone.

Whether you call it *Gamification* or *Fun Theory*, in the end its all about positive change. And of course, the points.
