\*Full Disclosure, I am a Jew but I&#8217;m more -ish\*

I spent most of last week really sick. I slept the most I have in years, 12-14 hours every night, plus naps. There may have been some homemade chicken soup involved. And I spent almost no time on my iPhone. My laptop didn&#8217;t get very much love either. As a person who quite frequently is actively using her phone, laptop, and an iPad at the same time it was a huge shift for me.

<a href="http://hypenotic.com/fun-stuff/7951/the-jews-get-it-right-again/attachment/sick-cat" rel="attachment wp-att-7984"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7984" title="sick-cat" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/sick-cat.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>When you&#8217;re couch bound and sleeping solidly you get a glimpse of a different life. Your regular day to day routine and stressors are replaced by a fairly simple existence.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve been that relaxed in a really long time. Instead of my usual litany of rolling to-do&#8217;s, multiple in-boxes to check, and the weight of deadlines I simply pondered which soup I wanted and would I have apple sauce or jell-o? I knit. I read from an actual hardcover book.

More than one of my friends has related the same thing to me. The only real time off they&#8217;ve had lately comes from being incredibly sick. And I think it comes from our in-ability to unplug. It&#8217;s more and more difficult to stop constantly searching for information to share or want to know what&#8217;s going on all the time. I have six email accounts, four Twitter accounts and one for work, monitor five Facebook accounts; two of which are mine, three Tumblrs, LinkedIn, Foursquare, G+, Path, and two google reader accounts. And I love it. I find it all incredibly interesting and stimulating. But I am losing sleep and downtime.

Jews have had a <a href="http://hypenotic.com/fun-stuff/7951/the-jews-get-it-right-again/attachment/unplugged" rel="attachment wp-att-7987">sabbath</a> for thousands of years. From Friday at sundown to Saturday at sundown Orthodox Jews (and otherwise) take a day of rest. <a href="http://hypenotic.com/fun-stuff/7951/the-jews-get-it-right-again/attachment/unplugged-2" rel="attachment wp-att-7996"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-7996" title="unplugged" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/unplugged1-250x250.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" /></a>The idea is that you take that time to get closer to God, celebrate your time together and your family.  You can read and talk and study and eat (yum!) but you can&#8217;t use any technology.  And this day of rest is now being adopted as a <a href="http://switchofftunein.org/" target="_blank">screen free</a> day by a growing number of people.

I think it&#8217;s a brilliant idea, and something I&#8217;m hoping to introduce into my own life but without a landline I&#8217;m not sure how I could go a whole day without using my smartphone. Have you gone screen free yet? Did you make it a whole day? How did it work for you?
