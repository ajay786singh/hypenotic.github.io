I happened to mention on twitter a few characters&#8217; names from one of my favourite shows, *Damages*. The next day I found I was being followed by the lead character herself, Patty Hewes [played wonderfully by Glenn Close].

I suppose I opened myself to such a follow. All the marketers have to do is search twitter for any reference to the show, and bang, you&#8217;re sent a message from your latest follower. I can choose not to follow back, but I&#8217;m curious to see if the plot will advance any more than on the show itself. Will I learn anything that tv viewers won&#8217;t? If you know the show, it&#8217;s full of twists and turns and cryptic story lines, which—unlike *Lost* or *Heroes*—actually work well.

I have to give props to the marketers for using this social medium to keep viewers interested between episodes. And I have the option to ignore it, which isn&#8217;t always possible with advertising.

If you know her character, you&#8217;ll realize Patty Hewes actually isn&#8217;t one likely to take time to tweet, but my curiosity has certainly been piqued.
