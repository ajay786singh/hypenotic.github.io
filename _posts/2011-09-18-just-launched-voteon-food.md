I&#8217;ve been absent from this blog lately. My nose has been to the grindstone, helping [Sustain Ontario][1] launch their new initiative, [VoteON Food & Farming][2].

It&#8217;s a rallying call to Ontarians to make sure their candidates in the upcoming October 6th [provincial election][3] get the message: Food matters to voters and we must take food policy seriously.

It&#8217;s also also a place for Sustain Ontario to share their [Good Food Ideas][4] and give you a platform to share [your own good food ideas.][5]

And VoteOn makes it easy for you to [write your candidates][6] to tell them why food matters to you.

Over the last year and a half, I&#8217;ve found myself exposed to a lot of new (to me) ideas about food. Having clients like Sustain Ontario, [Fiesta Farms][7], <a class="zem_slink" title="Local Food Plus" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Food_Plus" rel="wikipedia">Local Food Plus</a> and [OCTA][8] doesn&#8217;t hurt.

Nor does working for [someone][9] whose passion for food is only matched by his passion for helping people doing good things in the food space tell their stories well.

  <p>
    Mostly what I&#8217;ve learned is the impact our food choices have on the world around us.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As <a title="VoteON: why food and farming?" href="http://voteonfood.ca/why-food-farming">VoteOn explains</a>, food directly effects the economy, our health, the environment, our kids,  our experience of community and our farmers.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    That won&#8217;t be news to many of our regular readers, but for many Ontarians, it&#8217;s food for thought.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you&#8217;re passionate about the food you eat and share, be sure to engage your candidates on these issues this election. <a title="VoteONfood.ca" href="http://voteonfood.ca">VoteONfood.ca</a> is a good place to start.<img class="zemanta-pixie-img" style="border: none; float: right;" src="http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=a7201da0-9326-489d-a077-1901dff91cf6" alt="" />
