I call it being &#8216;consciously deliberate&#8217;.

It&#8217;s about being mindful of the pressures that inform our decisions, at whatever level. For example, this year, while visiting shipping our kids down to Florida for time with both sets of their grandparents, I didn&#8217;t feel compelled to look for a single sale.

I usually pop out at least boxing day to find a blazer or something at a third of the regular cost. This year, I was simply too conscious of where things come from and what it takes to get them to me at that price for the price allure to influence. I didn&#8217;t go shopping once. Instead, I&#8217;m now going to have to figure out how to find clothes made in Canada (or close) with ethically sourced materials.

On a productivity level, you can look at these pragmatic ideas for [putting email in its][1] place by Mike Rooney. They should help you avoid the urge to check email like you&#8217;re the head surgeon somewhere during a pandemic so you can stop interrupting the flow the actually important work you&#8217;re doing when email calls. The big ideas in it are:

*   Turn off all email notifications (in case you still use a notifier for some reason)
*   Don’t check email when you can’t process it
*   Aggregate non-urgent emails with Use Unroll.me (compiles repeat emails int a single folder)
*   Batch Email with Inbox Pause (manually turn on email reception when you need it

And in perhaps the coolest example of a deliberate choice to make the world a better place, I think you&#8217;ll enjoy this piece about a man who moved in with his parents for a year so he could give up his house to someone who needs it more.
