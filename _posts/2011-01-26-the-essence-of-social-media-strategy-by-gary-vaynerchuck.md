In a great article in Inc. Magazine, Gary Vaynerchuck, the passionate voice and face of Wine Library TV  lets us in on his day.

He&#8217;s clearly addicted to social media, which is a topic for another discussion, but he drops a strategic nugget that can&#8217;t be overstated.

It&#8217;s one of the insights that will help you separate the exploding ranks of folks billing themselves as social media experts just because they spend time on Twitter, Facebook and Foursquare from those who can help you achieve measurable,  sustainable returns that tie back to your business goals.

> Some people think I&#8217;m a huckster, but with the show, my intent isn&#8217;t to sell our wine. It&#8217;s to educate people about wine. There&#8217;s a big difference. Too many companies think they want to do a video blog to sell merchandise, but if you turn your site into QVC, you lose. I have an audience that trusts me. It&#8217;s about building a global brand—not selling four more bottles of Pinot Grigio.

Wine Library sells wine by day. At the store. That&#8217;s not what their marketing does. Their marketing helps people learn more about wine. Gary Vaynerchuck is on a mission to make wine more accessible. To unravel the layers of pompous, posturing jargon and to put down the positioning that makes most people uncomfortable buying wine.  Or used to.

It&#8217;s a win/win/win:

*   He gains credibility–a critical asset online, where trust–not cash, is king.
*   The audiences who enjoy his material get free insight shared by a passionate leader.
*   The entire wine industry benefits from the buyers Gary is developing.

A: That&#8217;s what we call Meaningful Marketing.

B: What can you credibly and passionately be helping people take part in?
