Just came across a very interesting project by [Leonard Cheshire Disability][1]. In their new campaign to promote awareness, they have partnered with Aardman Animations of Wallace & Grommet fame, creating online games and videos.

I&#8217;d like to see more of these types of games — not only does it expand the player universe, but helps others gain a better understanding of the value of things many of us take for granted.
