I&#8217;m here to stand up for children and childhood. Parents, I understand your modern aesthetic. Everything has to be minimal. Your couches are white and your children are kept prisoner in the basement so their dirty little fingers don&#8217;t mess with your oh-so-zen decor. Okay, fine.

Well people, this is where I draw the line. I was willing to stomach the new [child-sized Starck Ghost Chair][1], but now I&#8217;m pissed. Let me put it plainly,  if you find yourself craving this $100  Bruno Limberger-designed ash-wood coin bank[<img class="size-medium wp-image-425 alignleft" style="border: 20px solid white;" title="picture-34" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/picture-34.png" alt="" width="287" height="227" />][2] from [Design Within Reach][3], we need to have a little talk.

I feel a little like Chris Farley, but I&#8217;ll say it anyway:  &#8220;FOR GOD SAKES, LET THE KID HAVE A PIGGY BANK!&#8221; And by the way, please get over yourself.

Thank you,

The Association for the Preservation of Childhood
