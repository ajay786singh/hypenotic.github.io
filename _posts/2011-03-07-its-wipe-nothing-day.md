title: 'It&#8217;s Wipe Nothing Day'
author: Jodi Lastman
excerpt: |
  We use disposable wipes for far too often and just for the sake of convenience. The result of our "use and toss" culture is more landfill, and more waste which we don't have the space to manage. So, I declare today Wipe Nothing Day. Hope it's a good one.

    The latest incarnation of wipes, called <a href="http://www.boogiewipes.com/">Boogie wipes</a>, saline wipes that &#8220;dissolve boogers,&#8221; had me thinking about all of the various wipes we use and how they create meaningless landfill&#8211;all part of our &#8220;use and toss&#8221; culture of convenience.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So, I declare today <strong>Wipe Nothing Day.</strong> Of course you&#8217;ll need to wipe some things, but please, keep it to a necessary limit.
