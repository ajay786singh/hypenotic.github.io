When I was completing the most recent version of the [B Corp Assessmen][1]t today, this set of questions caught my attention. Anything jump out at you?

I find it fascinating that Payday Loans are sandwiched between GMOs and porn on this list.

Not sure what they are? In short, payday loans are short term, unsecured loans that are to be paid on, you got it, payday.

So what makes them so bad?

I set out on a journey to dig deeper. I admit, I&#8217;ve been increasingly curious about payday loans as I&#8217;ve watched them multiply like weeds in the downtown core. So, why is[ Mr. Payday][2] considered Mr. Monsanto&#8217;s next door neighbour? Here&#8217;s what you need to know.

**Why Payday Loans?**

*   Payday loans target the working poor whose needs are largely ignored by Canada&#8217;s mainstream financial institutions
*   For those without credit payday loans may be the only safety net in times of financial need or crisis
*   Poor people are disproportionately subject to judgments and garnishments that make it preferable to operate in cash
*   Payday loan outlets tend to have convenient hours and super friendly service. And the whole transaction takes about 15 mins no questions asked.

  <strong>So, What&#8217;s the Problem?</strong>
</div>

*   In Canada, the average payday loan has an interest rate of 350-600% APR (Annual Percentage Rate). By contrast, a gold Visa card has a 9.9% APR interest rate
*   According to a research report by the [Centre for Responsible Lending][3] (CRL) &#8220;A full three quarters of loan volume of the payday lending industry is generated by borrowers who, after meeting the short-term due date of the loan, must re-borrow before their next pay period&#8221; In other words, its not the first loan that&#8217;s the problem, it&#8217;s the loan on the loan on the loan.
*   This inability to pay is what&#8217;s called a &#8220;rollover.&#8221; As CRL found rolling over loans accounts for 76 percent of total loan volume in Canada
*   A US [study of payday loan customers][4] found that &#8220;about 20% had rolled over 9 or more advances.&#8221;
*   In 29 of the 35 US states that permit this kind of lending, payday loan storefronts outnumber McDonalds&#8217; restaurants ([NTY, 2009][5])

  <strong>So, What&#8217;s the Solution?</strong>
</div>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Of course, ensuring a living wage for people is the best way to reduce the seduction of the payday loan. The Stop&#8217;s <a href="http://putfoodinthebudget.ca/">Put Food in the Budget </a>shows how far Toronto&#8217;s poor need to stretch their dollars just to manage their basic needs each month. And if an emergency comes up, you&#8217;re shit out of luck.
    </li>
    <li>
      Currently Canadian law doesn&#8217;t allow for peer to peer lending like <a href="http://www.prosper.com/">Prosper</a> in the US. Canada&#8217;s <a href="http://www.communitylend.com/">Community Lend</a> (who we worked with when they were just starting out) is, as you can see &#8220;no longer accepting applicants.&#8221; That&#8217;s because (and they put it nicely) &#8220;P2P Lending, as it needs to operate within the Canadian regulatory system today, has enough headwinds blowing against it that getting to a significant scale was going to be both expensive and difficult.&#8221; That&#8217;s a shame
    </li>
    <li>
      Credit Unions in the US have offered lower interest alternatives to Payday Loans with much success. In Wisconsin, <a href="https://www.prospera.ca/">Prospera</a> credit union has <a href="http://www.goodmoneystore.com/">GoodMoney</a> loans, Based within Goodwill stores these loans charge half the interest of payday lenders.
    </li>
  </ul>

In case you&#8217;re interested in knowing the lived experience of Payday loans, jere&#8217;s a short video CRL put together to describe one US woman&#8217;s experience.
