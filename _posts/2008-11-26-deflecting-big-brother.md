[Short film][2] educating those who believe that certain tactics employed by governments are in the name of security. Large scale terrorist attacks seem only like an excuse to violate a citizen&#8217;s rights to freedoms. Britons have it especially bad, being constantly watched via CCTV, so it&#8217;s not surprising that projects like Big Brother State are coming to the fore.

oh, and it&#8217;s beautifully animated by German-based [David Scharf][3]. A must-see.
