  Loons and Lemonade at Four Mile Lake
</h4>

The residents of Four Mile Lake, near the Bobcaygeon, are pretty proud of their lake being home to more than one pair of loons. When loon babies are hatched in this community, you hear about it. However its still rare to see the loons, let alone get close to them, and so what are the odds that a boat would hit one, let alone 2 simultaneously?

Shockingly- that’s exactly what happened last August on Four Mile Lake.

The loss of two 8 week old loon babies was devastating news to the community.  Something had to be done. So 6 year old Avery Spitz had a lemonade stand. Avery promised to give the money she made from the stand to the local Wildlife Sanctuary, and thirsty neighbors poured in. 400$ and an unknown number of lemons later, Avery was local news and a local hero. And when two new baby loons were spotted on the lake later that season, Four Mile Lake residents had happy news to talk about once again.
