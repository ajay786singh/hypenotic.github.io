I had been waiting for quite a long time for this moment and finally here it is, I’m starting a new full-time job. It has been a long journey, literally! Here’s the story of how I got here.

<a href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/6722/how-did-i-get-here/attachment/blogpost-graphic" rel="attachment wp-att-6723"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6723" title="life's a journey!" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/blogpost-graphic-580x392.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="392" /></a>

Once upon a time in Mexico, there was a graphic designer called Angelica who worked at a web design company in the city. For a while everything seemed to fit into place, she learned what she had to learn and after two years moved on looking for new challenges, but where to? She wanted to work somewhere where she could find further relevance in her practice.

Her brother Alex, trying to give some existential/professional guidance recommended some books and authors, among them, Life Style by Bruce Mau and [Massive Change][1] by [The Institute without Boundaries][2]. “It&#8217;s not about the world of design. It&#8217;s about the design of the world.&#8221;  That totally resonated with her so she did some research about the Institute without Boundaries and discovered it was a one-year post-graduate program in Toronto. The idea of eventually being part of the program stuck in the back of her mind.

Time passed and Angelica became a freelance designer working from home and getting some contract work from time to time with architecture and design firms in Mexico City.

She liked projects where she could communicate significant messages through beautiful mediums. She also enjoyed working in creative multidisciplinary teams and she was lucky enough to work with very talented architects, illustrators, musicians, filmmakers, photographers, programmers and even a poet. On the other hand she didn’t like tedious technical work because she felt that sometimes it devaluated her profession. She also didn’t like working in isolation.

At this point Angelica felt she had a fair bit of experience to take it to the next level and decided to apply the Institute without Boundaries. She got in and moved to Toronto.

The year as an IwB student passed very fast and was very intense. She and her classmates worked hard to develop a proposal for a low-income housing neighbourhood in Toronto called Flemingdon Park. She got to overcome challenging situations that would seem totally scary for her before, like facilitating architecture charrettes, giving client presentations, speaking English every day… but most importantly she learned about using design methods to solve complex problems.

Soon the school year was over a new generation of students was ready to get into IwB. This time the assignment was in Lota, a small town in Chile and there was an opportunity for Angelica to stick around at the IwB and work as a facilitator, translator and graphic communicator. So she stayed another year with a part time job at the Institute without Boundaries supporting the new students. She even had the opportunity to travel to Lota as supporting faculty. That was one cool experience.

Angelica knew that she couldn’t stay at the IwB forever and started looking for a full time job in order to keep growing and keep gaining experiences in Canada. She went to many interviews and sent many résumés and cover letters. There were moments when Angelica was losing hope in finding the right job. She even considered going back to Mexico, she was homesick, she was cold and she had probably a bit of a vitamin D deficiency. She just wanted to find the right fit in a place that was creative but also cared about strategy, somewhere where she could contribute but also be enriched, she knew there had to be a place out there.

Then suddenly, it happened. The stars aligned. Coincidently, on the same week, two totally unrelated people referred Angelica to a small company called Hypenotic. They told her that their art director was about to leave and they were looking for someone. She decided to introduce herself and send an email to Barry who invited her to the office to have coffee and discuss mutual interests and goals. It turned out to be the right fit, right place and right time!

The End.

I hope you liked this story, (I happen to love happy endings). However I think this is just the beginning of a new story that is starting here at Hypenotic. I’ll do my best to share the most interesting chapters along the way.
