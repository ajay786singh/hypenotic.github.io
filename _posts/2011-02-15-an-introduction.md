Hello everyone!

On this sunny Tuesday morning I&#8217;d like for you to help me welcome the latest addition to Hypenotic&#8230; myself! Yes, me, Agata. I&#8217;m super excited to become part of such wonderful team of creative people who are bursting with ideas, amazing energy and the drive to have a positive impact on the community through meaningful marketing. So, let&#8217;s get down to business.

My name is Agata Ivanna Pogorelsky and I was born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina. At age 18 -now you want to know how old I am, right?- I moved to Canada, landing in the coldest place I could have ever imagined: Winnipeg. After a year at University of Manitoba, in the Fine Arts program, I moved to Toronto to pursue my acting a career. Ryerson Theater School was a wonderful experience but the language barrier was too big at the time to continue three more years of studies. In 2006, I dropped out of the program and got accepted into the School of Image Arts, which gave me enough flexibility to experiment, play and learn about all the things that excite me, such as photography, video editing, graphic arts and of course, performance. 

My work experience is as broad as Winnipeg&#8217;s annual thermal amplitude: I have waited tables, administered offices, driven trucks, filmed and edited music videos for local bands and fashion shows, cleaned houses, animated typography for multi-media theater plays, photographed events as a free-lancer-for-free, taught Spanish, etc, etc, etc; you get my point. I&#8217;m extremely delighted to embark on a journey as part of Hypenotic&#8217;s staff, where I will be able -and encouraged- to combine my various skills and talents working for clients that are doing things that matter to people. Talk about meaningful marketing, eh?

So, how about I give you a little something and introduce you to my alter-ego Fatima Popolopulis? Turn your speakers on and embrace yourself as you join me on a journey to the depths of the Giraffe Center in Nairobi, Kenya. Karibu!
