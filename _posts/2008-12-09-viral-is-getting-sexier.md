*watch the hi-res clip here at the [doghouse site][1].*

I have to say I&#8217;m impressed with the quality of online productions these days. The ante has been upped by agencies who have realized that the internet is a viable medium for video marketing, and that consumers are a lot more discerning than previously imagined. These are heavy challengers to the youtube crowd.

*The Doghouse* is the recently launched campaign by JC Penny, created by Saatchi &#038; Saatchi NY in collaboration with Razorfish. The high quality of the online video helps take the sting out of the fact that you&#8217;re watching an ad for mid-range retailer JC Penny [and their jewelry department at that. I'd have to say that if my husband bought me jewelry from JC Penny, the Doghouse is where he would *hope* to wind up].

The campaign also includes Facebook Connect that allows FB users to place their network friends in the poocher; plus the ability to send email notifications to those facing banishment.

The cliché idea of putting your man in the doghouse is not one I subscribe to, nor usually find funny, but this did make me laugh, and big ups to the creative minds behind it.
