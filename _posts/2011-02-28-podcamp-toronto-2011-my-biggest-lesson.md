On Saturday, the first day of [Podcamp Toronto 201 1][1], Lionel, our Lead digital designer/dev sent me about 20 emails from the sessions he was in. Not about what people were saying, but about what his brain was saying, catalysed by what he was hearing.

I read his notes from my couch, where I was working on a proposal (not even with my family!). Work is more important than inspiration right? Well, I shouldn&#8217;t put it that way. I&#8217;m inspired daily by things I read, people I work with and the flashes of insight that come to me every time I walk to/from work or to the bathroom (everyone walks out of our bathrooms with an idea. Try it!) daily.

But I rarely go to conferences with my peers.  I&#8217;ve been attending and speaking at conferences focussed on my client&#8217;s issues. Since we have many clients in the food and social justice space, this can be yummy and rewarding. But in the few hours I caught today, I:

*   Heard [5 dynamic women][2] lay out the trials of a bringing  a strategic approach to big brand marketing in a digital era as well as their thoughts on the opportunities ahead of us (worth a whole post in and of itself)  in THE KICK-ASS WOMEN OF NEW & SOCIAL MEDIA
*   Caught a state of the union update on what big companies like Edelman are thinking about measurement (ditto the last brackets, maybe two posts) from Rob Clark, one of the few folks you&#8217;ll meet with the word &#8216;measurement&#8217; in his job title
*   Connected with about 2o smart, interesting folks I intend to keep up with, and re-connected with 5 I haven&#8217;t seen in a while
*   Picked up 15 new twitter followers
*   Learned that for folks in a virtual vacuum, we&#8217;re on top of our shit
*   Enjoyed being in rooms full of people who were interested in tactics, but knew they were in service to a strategy
*   Connected with an old acquaintance who happens to need a mobile app with features we&#8217;ve been testing
*   Connected with a community of interest

It took me over an hour (with a stop at [Porchetta][3]), but I walked the whole way home just to keep the wheels turning.

There are several conferences who&#8217;s douche-factor I can still taste when I think about them, so the jury&#8217;s still out on how much energy I can devote to communing with the communications industry at large. But the experience I had today made it pretty clear that there&#8217;s plenty of value in bouncing ideas off people facing the same challenges you are.

It&#8217;s nice to spend a day when you&#8217;re not expected to have all the answers.

Thanks, Podcamp.
