It&#8217;s not everyday UFO sightings happen in and around Ontario Lakes. Unless you happen to be talking about Minden&#8217;s Boshkung Lake in the early 70&#8242;s.

Minden residents, Mr and Mrs. Ashley Lunham,  were visited by a wide range of alien objects in 1973 and 74. The visits were so frequent, in fact, that they referred to the frozen lake outside their home as a &#8220;virtual parking lot.&#8221;  Some of the objects were shaped like cigars, other like polliwogs. They had sometimes red, blue and white lights. They always displayed nine antennae and their takeoff resembled a rubber ball. Curt Sutherly&#8217;s book [UFO Mysteries ][1] has an entire chapter dedicated to [The Invasion of Boshkung Lak][2]e. In it he features all of the folks who also witnessed the strange flying objects.

Sutherly&#8217;s book features a local journalist who decided to take on the case.  After several fruitless visits to the frozen lake the journalist, equipped with a camera, finally saw an object with a red light high over lake Boshkung.  It was then that ten snowmobilers  from Minden arrived on the ice and began shooting at the object, attempting to ambush the interlopers. A &#8220;distinct clunk&#8221; could be heard as bullets careened off the flying objects.

A local housewife, Mrs. Barnes, who was among 50 witnesses to the bizarre object that night commented &#8220;We can&#8217;t all be crazy.&#8221;
