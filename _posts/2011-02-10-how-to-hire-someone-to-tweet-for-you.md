Let me start by saying that having someone tweet for you is almost never a good idea. [Kenneth Col][1][e][2] can tell you more about the dangers. So can [Price Chopper][3].

In fact, there are only a few situations that make a ghost-tweeter a good fit.

1.  The person in question is identified as a separate entity, brings you credibility,  and is responsible for community management–that is, they&#8217;re hired to implement a communications strategy that partly manifests on  twitter. An example here is [Ivy Knight&#8217;s][4] work on [Fiesta Farms][5] or [Jodi&#8217;s][6] work for [Ontario&#8217;s Own][7]. They each do a lot more than tweet. And it&#8217;s never about themselves unless they believe the info useful.
2.  It&#8217;s your corporate account, you have multiple voices–but even then they should be identifiable somewhere, in a blog post, etc
3.  You&#8217;re a trouble maker like Guy Kawasaki and [gaming the system][8] while you can.
4.  It&#8217;s promotional–Sonya here just mentioned a tattoo parlour that has a guest tweeter for a week. Fun stuff.
5.  I&#8217;m open to more, do share.

When is it a particularly bad idea?

When you hire some random self-styled social media guru without a communications strategy, a metrics tracking plan, or check-ins to assess the influence of their work. You can tell these people because they call themselves experts (if they see the word &#8216;guru&#8217;, please throw something wet at them).

Social media marketing is new. We&#8217;re really five years into developing pragmatic approaches and measuring the right performance indicators. We have a leg up from the amazing work done in the Search Engine Optimization universe, but that space evolves quickly as well. And frankly, the world of websites is also being affected by expectations people develop from their experiences on social platforms and mobile devices.

Problems range from wasting your money on a hamster wheel you&#8217;re paying someone else to get fit on to turning people off with inanity. It&#8217;s honestly mind-blowing in an era where [a quick search will help you avoid the most established pitfalls][9] that these amount of inanity on twitter persists. These people are dropping small turds all over the internet and stamping your brand on them. Repulsive? Now you&#8217;re getting it.

The barrier to a decent tweet is just SO fucking low. The notion that someone being paid to represent your organization can&#8217;t come up with more than an encouragement to buy your product is an offense that paints all marketers. We&#8217;ve just got the twitter canard about &#8220;doing your laundry&#8221; or what people ate for dinner&#8221; in the rear view mirror and these &#8216;pros&#8217; show up and drop a load on the windshield.

I&#8217;m uncomfortable calling out local brands on this (though I might start soon), this is after all, supposed to be instructive. So here&#8217;s what to do about it.

1.  Only talk to prospective representers who&#8217;s work you know and like.
2.  If you don&#8217;t know anyone and don&#8217;t know the space well enough to assess, get a referral from someone who does.
3.  Make sure they get what you stand for. If an honest self-assessment suggests this knowledge must be developed, hire someone who can help you with it (If you&#8217;re doing something that doesn&#8217;t suck, try us).
4.  Learn how to create a useful presence on twitter, from your profile image and bio to who you should be connecting with on what topics.
5.  Help other people. It&#8217;s a community. You become popular by being useful. The more useful you are to more influential people, the better you&#8217;re doing.
6.  Define specifically who you&#8217;d like to be building relationships with and why.
7.  Define ways to learn from and iterate on your attempts.

If your designated tweeter isn&#8217;t doing this strategically, they&#8217;re polluting the twitter stream of those too lazy to unfollow them with irrelevance. It would be great if your brand could become part of the solution instead of the problem. Hell that&#8217;s a good strategy right there–call it meaningful marketing.

Do feel free to fire back. This rant is over.
