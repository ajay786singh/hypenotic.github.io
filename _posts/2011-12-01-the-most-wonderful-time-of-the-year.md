Desperate for a hit of caffeine this morning I stumbled into Starbucks. The red cups are out, and with them come the eggnog, gingerbread, and peppermint lattes. The holiday snacks, which are a million times better than the usual menu, gingerbread loaves, peppermint brownie cake pops, and my dearest friend the cranberry bliss bar. (I like to support indie coffee shops as much as I can but I will cut you for the last cranberry bliss bar.)

In less than a week my Dad will start his holiday baking, <a href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/1160/simmerandstir-christmas-cake" target="_blank">Christmas cake</a> which is actually yummy; rich, crumbly golden <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2008/10/twice-baked-shortbread-other-lost-recipes/" target="_blank">shortbread</a>; and a plum pudding with buttery hard sauce (butter, sugar, brown booze what isn&#8217;t good about that?). I have two cookie baking party invites so far. Plates full of home made goodies are starting to appear in all kinds of unexpected places; even my hair salon has sugar dusted irresistible baked goods.

On top of all the yummy Christmas treats, there are also <a href="http://www.canadianliving.com/food/baking_and_desserts/hanukkah_treats__5_doughnut_delights.php" target="_blank">Hanukkah goodies</a>. <a href="http://www.foiledagainchocolate.com/buy_coins" target="_blank">Chocolate coins</a>, <a href="http://www.sweetcitycandy.com/Chanukah-Candy" target="_blank">dreidels</a> full of smarties (so retro!), deep fried sweets, and the incredible <a href="http://www.epicurious.com/articlesguides/holidays/hanukkah/todd-aarons-cocktail-party?intcid=epi_hptile2" target="_blank">gourmet</a> <a href="http://www.epicurious.com/articlesguides/holidays/hanukkah/todd-aarons-cocktail-party?intcid=epi_hptile2" target="_blank">variations</a> on <a href="http://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/menus/hanukkah/2008/12/hanukkah_menu_guide" target="_blank">potato latkes</a>.

(Dear Body, I&#8217;m sorry to try to obfuscate  your efforts to put on your winter weight, something the human body has been doing for thousands of years in this climate.) And the dire warning that the average person gains between 5-10 pounds over the holidays.

As a fat kid, I snuck all the holiday treats I could smuggle back to my room, along with a crushing sense of guilt for wanting it and an incredible sense of glee for enjoying all of my bounty in a way that the adults in my life could never seem to let themselves. As an adult I still have that same sense of glee around the holidays (surprisingly 7 years in retail didn&#8217;t kill it, I just have a moratorium on Christmas songs until December 20th.) And I&#8217;m no longer going to feel bad around holiday food.

And on that note I&#8217;m giving you the best holiday gift I can think of this year. The average person gains <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200003233421206" target="_blank">one pound</a> over the holidays.  That&#8217;s it. So stop worrying and feeling guilty around your special delicious food and enjoy it instead.  Happy Holidays!
