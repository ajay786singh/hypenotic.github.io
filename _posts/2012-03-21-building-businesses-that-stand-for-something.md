Read a great article this morning by <a title="About Chuck Templeton" href="http://www.fastcoexist.com/users/chuck-templeton" target="_blank">Chuck Templeton</a> that sums up the benefits of doing business ethically/sustainably, including a better long-term bottom line.

I had to comment:

> This article expresses why part of me cringes when people bring up CSR. It&#8217;s typically practiced as a band-aid solution to an issue AND as a marketing strategy. It does a diservice to both. It just doesn&#8217;t wash to try to distract people from margins created unsustainably/unethically by doing good somewhere else.

The challenge for many is that they&#8217;ve been taught to hide the negative side of their business for so long that they have trouble fathoming the benefits of addressing their issues publicly.

For others, there are legitimate hurdles like laws that demand quarterly shareholder growth and a lack of business instruments for making choices that offer social impact in the short term and financial returns in the long. For these situations, and archaic legislation that prevents charitable organizations from making a profit while doing good, there&#8217;s a <a title="Mobilizing Private Capital for Public Good: Canadian Task force on Social Finance" href="http://www.marsdd.com/dmsassets/reports/socialfinance_taskforcereport_2010.pdf" target="_blank">task force</a> working on it.

Long story short. If you knew that improving your practices or your industry publicly could be your markting and could build towards a healthier bottom line, would you?

What&#8217;s holding you back?
