No one is quite sure how Bob&#8217;s Lake got its name. It seems not many Bobs passed through Frontenac region in Eastern Ontario in the mid Nineteenth Century. According to the book [The Dammed Lakes, An Environmental History of Crow and Bobs Lake][1]s the lake was named after the member of a native band&#8211;either Algonquin or Mississauga&#8211;who passed through the region. Here are a list of possible Bob candidates:

*   There were two Mississauga named Robert – Blacker and Mitchell. But neither was called “Bob” and neither has a known connection to the lake
*   There was a Mississauga named “Bob” but he left the region in 1827&#8211;too early in time for his name to be passed along
*   There were European settlers named Robert, but again no known Bobs

It may take some time before the mystery of Bob&#8217;s lake is resolved. But until then&#8230;.baby steps
