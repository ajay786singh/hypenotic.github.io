Hello world,

My name is Dorothy and I am the intern at Hypenotic for the next few months!

I&#8217;m roughly two weeks in, so it&#8217;s time I introduced myself.

My lifelong goal is to become a missionary, perhaps in Myanmar or China or even Germany; I&#8217;m not exactly sure yet, but I know it will happen one day.  
My dream job would be to illustrate childrens&#8217; books.  
My all-time favourites are C.S. Lewis, George Balanchine, Simon & Garfunkel, William Turner, rabbits, and pretzels with butter in them.

I am an architecture student in my final year at the University of Waterloo; *how strange,* you say? Indeed.

This semester, I was convinced that I didn&#8217;t want to intern at an architecture office.

I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m just unlucky, but my past architecture internships have consisted of working on deadline-oriented, money-busting, consumeristic, elitist architecture for fashionable clients (I hope I don&#8217;t sound bitter). This is the final co-op semester before I graduate from architecture school, so I wanted to try something that would refresh and re-inspire me about design, that good design is design with a purpose (a good purpose at that).

I am particularly interested in learning more about communications design because it is potentially a powerful tool in catalyzing connection between people.

There is something very special about graphics because it is communications in its purest form, virtually accessible to anybody &#8212; it transcends academia levels and language barriers.

I came across Hypenotic while googling a list of of design firms in Toronto (nothing fancy).  
Beyond the awesome name, Hypenotic stuck out to me, because this office is concerned with values-driven projects, projects that actually make a positive difference in the community and in daily life. I reckoned that over the next few months, I would learn several things to carry with me in the career ahead.

Sincerely delighted upon the happenstance of Hypenotic&#8217;s website showing up on google,

Dorothy.
