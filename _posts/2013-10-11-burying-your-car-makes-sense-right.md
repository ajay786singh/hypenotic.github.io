  Inspired by the Pharaohs
</h2>

62-year-old Brazilian businessman Thane Chiquinho Scarpa (aka &#8220;Count Scarpa&#8221;) loved his [Bentley Continental Flying Spur][1] so much, he announced that he will be burying it so that he can use it in the afterlife, stating:

> &#8216;I decided to do as the Pharaohs: this week I will bury my favourite car, the Bentley here in the home garden! Bury my treasure in my palace!!!&#8221;

Naturally, this stirred up a lot of social media buzz. After only a couple of days, the Bentley&#8217;s funeral had acquired over  5680 likes and more than 6000 shares.

People were outraged that Scarpa wasn&#8217;t donating the money or car to charity. Not to mention the fact that they was some serious criticism for his selfishness of putting a car in the ground—somewhere nobody can use it.

Turns out, it was all a ruse to bring awareness to one of the most selfless acts a person is capable of performing.

  &#8220;The biggest waste of the world&#8221;
</h2>

On the day of the burial, Scarpa invited reporters to the back of his mansion so that they could cover the momentous event.

Just as the car was about to go in the ground, he stopped the ceremony and gave this wonderful speech*:

> &#8220;People were condemning me because I wanted to bury my Bentley, in fact most people bury something a lot more valuable than my car. They bury hearts, livers, lungs, kidneys.
> 
> This is absurd.
> 
> So many people are waiting for a transplant, and you will bury your healthy organs that can save so many lives.
> 
> This is the biggest waste of the world.
> 
> My Bentley is worthless compared to this.
> 
> No richness is more valuable than an organ, because nothing is more valuable than a life.&#8221;

This is one publicity stunt that I think was a complete success not only in advertising Organ Donation, but also in pointing out how much value we put on our possessions.

If you are interested in becoming an organ donor, you can visit this [website][2], and please pass on the information to those around you.
