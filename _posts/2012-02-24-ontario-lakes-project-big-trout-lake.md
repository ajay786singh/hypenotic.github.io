Big Trout Lake is home to a lake monster called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omajinaakoos" target="_blank">Omajinaakoos</a>, or &#8216;The Ugly One&#8217;. And  according to the Kitchenuhmaykoosib Inninuwug First Nations legend he&#8217;s an omen of bad luck. The most recent sighting of Omajinaakoos was in <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/ontario/article/812580--update-the-ugly-one-monster-mystery" target="_blank">May of 2010</a> when two Health Canada nurses stationed at the Kitchenuhmaykoosib Band reserve on Big Trout Lake went out for a walk with their dog and stumbled across an Omajinaakoos that had washed up on shore.

The Omajinaakoos are rumored to live in swamps and feed on beavers. When the monster was found it set off a major internet controversy and speculation as to what the Omajinaakoos actually was. It is believed most likely to be a <a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/292294" target="_blank">hoax</a> or an <a href="http://digitaljournal.com/article/292321" target="_blank">opossum</a> or <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/ontario/big-trout-lake-monster-sparks-internet-debate/article1576748/" target="_blank">otter</a> or some kind of <a href="http://digitaljournal.com/article/292321" target="_blank">mink</a>. What do you think? Is there a monster living in Big Trout Lake?
