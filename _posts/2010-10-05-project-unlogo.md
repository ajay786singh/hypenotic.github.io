A smart guy named Steve Crouse was doing work to help computers recognize corporate logos and realized he could use his technology chops for good. Check out the video he made to introduce the [Unlogo ][1]concept and ask folks to submit video he could &#8220;de-corporatize.&#8221;

[Unlogo Intro][2] from [Jeff Crouse][3] on [Vimeo][4].
