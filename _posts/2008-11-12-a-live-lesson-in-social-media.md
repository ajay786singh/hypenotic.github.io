I&#8217;ve checked in on this conversation surrounding Pepsi&#8217;s new bottles a bit over the last couple of months, but last night I got hooked on one of the centres of the debate. I read all 39 comments in a really interesting discussion. 

I&#8217;m not going to recap the whole story here–discover it along with the commenters and participants for an informative, entertaining, and articulate peek at a big commodity brand&#8217;s foray into social media.

If I had to take away one message, I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s &#8220;get involved&#8221;. Decide what you&#8217;d like to find out and start the conversation. There&#8217;s nothing like letting interested parties get you ink, and I love the poetry of giving up control of your brand (it was illusory anyway). 

I&#8217;m not a fan of teeth-rotting/obesity inducing, land-fill filling coloured water myself, but I can&#8217;t deny the humanizing effect of watching a giant take baby-steps. 

[Conversation I read last night.][1]

The (honestly) always interesting Valeria Maltoni&#8217;s participation in the actual exercise was where I first enjoyed [a take on the story][2].

And Brand New is another place to get some [in-depth insight][3].

Enjoy,
