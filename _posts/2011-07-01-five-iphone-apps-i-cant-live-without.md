In the fast-paced world that is modern digital marketing, there are some things you always need to have close to hand. Like your iPhone.

In fact, recently I mistakenly left my baby at home in the morning and I found myself struggling to focus all day. Remarkably, this thing I once lived without has become so important to the way I work.

With that in mind, here is a short list of some of my must-have apps. These are more than just gadgets. Most of these have worked themselves into my daily routine.[  
][1]

#### [Simplenote][1]

[ ][1]

[][1]

[Simplenote][2] is an wonderful and simple app for taking quick notes on the fly. Your notes can be tagged and they are easy to search or scroll through.

You can send your notes via email or publish them directly to the web for sharing with your friends right from the app.

You need a free Simplenote account, which gives you access to your notes online. They can also be synced with several free and paid software on both Mac and PCs (I use Notational Velocity on my MacBook) for universal access to your notes.[

#### [Dropbox][3]

[ ][3]

[][3]The [Dropbox ][4]iPhone app is a complement to the free Dropbox software on your computer and in the cloud. You can easily drag documents into the Dropbox folder on your desktop for reading later on your iPhone.

I always have an ebook or two on the go, which I read when I&#8217;m taking a break from my computer, or while waiting for a meeting.

#### [Reeder][5]

Every marketer needs a place to do their daily review of favourite blog posts to post, tweet, or use as inspiration for their own posts.

I&#8217;ve used several RSS readers on the iPhone. I resisted [Reeder][6] because some of the free ones are pretty good.

But one day after I&#8217;d heard the name Reeder repeatedly over the last week, I just broke down and bought it.

I have to say, this RSS reader is absolutely gorgeous and really good for reading on the go. The sharing features are top notch, too.[

#### [MailChimp][7]

[ ][7]

[][7]

If you&#8217;ve ever pulled the trigger on a critical newsletter or campaign mailing and then had to run off to a meeting, you&#8217;ve probably spent the whole meeting fretting about open rates, top links, and unsubscribes.

With the free [MailChimp][8] app for iPhone, you have all that information at your fingertip. The app has all the groovy visual style of MailChimp online with slick charts that keep you on top of your critical stats.[

#### [Ego][9]

[ ][9]

[][9]

Like the MailChimp app, [Ego][10] lets you keep track of key metrics on the go. In this case, Ego will keep you up to speed on your Google Analytics, Feedburner, tumblr and twitter stats, along with a few other apps.

If you can&#8217;t walk by a mirror, without checking to see how many twitter followers you have, Ego is for you.[  
][11]

#### [Instagram][11]

[ ][11]

[][11]

Like a cross between the Hipstamatic and flickr, [Instagram][12] lets you take photos, apply cool filters and effects, then share them with your network.

On this surface, it&#8217;s just plain fun. But Instagram can be an effective tool for quick content generation and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m including it here.

Now it&#8217;s your turn. What are your favourite marketing tools on the iPhone?
