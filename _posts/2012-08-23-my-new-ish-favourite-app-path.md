### **Platform:**

iOS, Android (I use it on my iPhone 4)

### **What it&#8217;s for:**

[Path][1] is a &#8220;closed&#8221; social network, to stay connected with your close friends & family. It acts as a journal of your life, where you can post, where you are, what you&#8217;re doing, who you&#8217;re with, and include a photo or video. It also sports a section for sharing what music you&#8217;re listening to, what movie you&#8217;re watching, or what book you&#8217;re reading. <img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-9739" title="path_2" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/path_2.png" alt="" width="135" height="132" />For the athletes out there, you can also sync it with your Nike Fuelband to keep track of your running/jogging/walking milage. Your &#8220;path&#8221; is only accessible to those whom you&#8217;ve accepted as a friend. Unlike Twitter, where you&#8217;re encouraged to openly share with everyone, and Facebook where you feel obliged to be friends with your entire school&#8217;s student body, Path has a slightly more personal touch.

Besides posting things, you also have the ability to include a &#8220;reaction&#8221; of sorts, on to other people&#8217;s posts. You can include a little &#8220;emotion&#8221;, regarding how you feel about a specific post, as well as a regular comment. The last neat feature is a button to post when you&#8217;re going to sleep and when you&#8217;ve just woken up. At first, the notion of sharing this seems a little creepy, but I&#8217;ve found it to be a nice feature to keep track of my sleeping patterns. Upon &#8220;waking up&#8221; in Path, it gives you the current weather conditions and temperature, as well as a log of how many hours you slept.

### **Why I like it:**

<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-9740" title="path_3" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/path_3.png" alt="" width="135" height="132" />Although I use and enjoy both Twitter, and Facebook, Path offers a slightly more personal and intimate experience. With my entire immediate family on it, I&#8217;ve enjoyed things like seeing my brother post all sorts of checkins and photos on a vacation he took with his fianc√© in Nova Scotia, or my Mom frowing at me when I eat fast food, or my Dad&#8217;s updates on his latest golf game.

It also sports a very clean, and easy to use interface, with lots of neat interactions. Admittedly, I occasionally spend too much time opening and closing the main menu, just to watch the animation toggle. Everything is pretty straightforward to use, and as a nice touch you can additionally push your posts to other social networks like Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr and Foursquare.

### **What could be better:**

First of all, Path only exists on mobile devices. The interface is sleek on the phones, but has a lot of potential for a different, web based layouts. When you share Path posts on other social networks, you get a look at that one post, but there&#8217;s no way to see all of you and your friend&#8217;s posts online in your browser. Although I suspect that it is partially my phones fault (the iPhone 4 is now almost two generations old, and I probably have too much stuff on it), but when I active the built-in camera in Path, it always takes a little longer than I like for it to fire up. Often, you&#8217;ll want a really quick snap of something to share, and I&#8217;ve missed a couple owing to the slowness of it. I&#8217;m interested to see how it is on an iPhone 4S, or on the soon to be released iPhone 5.

### **Who else might benefit from it:**

Anyone who wants to share moments with only the people they want will love this app. On Path, it&#8217;s not how many people you are friends with, but the quality of people, and the moments you share with them. It&#8217;s especially great for travellers & vacationers who want to instantly share their trip&#8217;s ongoings with friends and family. However you use it, Path is a great app to stay connected with those who matter to you.

### Where do I get it?:
