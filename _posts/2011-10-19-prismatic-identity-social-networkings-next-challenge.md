Chris Poole knows a thing or two about how people behave online. He founded free-form free for all net sensation [4chan][1] and [Canvas][2]. Don&#8217;t click the links if you don&#8217;t want to get stuck somewhere or question your sanity/sense of humour/values.

In this video from the[ web 2.0][3] summit in San Francisco that social networks that let us choose which facet of our personalities and/or interests we want to share will get online identity right.

I agree. I have friends who have 5 twitter accounts on which they interact with different audiences around often wildly different subject matter. Twitter makes it easier to disassociate your interests.

And I have clients still wrapping their heads around ways to use Facebook personally without overly influencing the way their brand is perceived on their Fan Page. Not that they&#8217;d do anything horrible online. But politics, religion, stances on or interests in specific social issues, they feel, can be inappropriate associations for their brand.

Chris suggests that Google Plus and Facebook both need to give users more control over context. The video is 8 minutes, but worth watching. Enjoy!
