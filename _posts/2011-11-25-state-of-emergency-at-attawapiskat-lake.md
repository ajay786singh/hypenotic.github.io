Last week as part of our Ontario Lakes Project series we created a blog post on <a href="http://hypenotic.com/ontario-lakes-project/7645/watch-natives-do-their-thing-at-attawapiskat-lake" target="_blank">Attawapiskat Lake</a>. Shortly after that<a href="http://blogs.vancouversun.com/2011/11/24/a-canadian-community-compared-to-haiti-at-minus-40c/" target="_blank"> news</a> <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2011/11/24/attawapiskat-housing.html" target="_blank">broke</a> that the residents of the Attawapiskat First Nation had declared a<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/charlie-angus/attawapiskat-emergency_b_1104370.html#undefined" target="_blank"> state of emergency</a>. The <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/1092057--red-cross-steps-in-to-help-attawapiskat-as-queen-s-park-and-ottawa-bicker" target="_blank">Red Cross</a> has now stepped in to help but shamefully neither our Federal or Provincial governments have committed to helping this community. XSPACE Cultural Centre is taking<a href="http://tacre.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"> donations</a> until Monday December 5th and as we hear of more events and donation points we&#8217;ll be updating this post. If you have any more info about helping the Attawapiskat First Nation please leave it in the comments.
