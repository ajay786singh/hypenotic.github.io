The comedian Louis CK has a gift for telling it straight. Turns out he also has a knack for marketing strategy:

> I said to [my agent], “Let’s do none of it.” … “Let’s find out if this is a huge mistake. Let’s find out. I’m willing to sacrifice my first theater tour and have the places empty and identify that it’s because I wouldn’t let the radio people participate. But we also might find out that it didn’t make a difference and that I never have to do it.”

All great marketers know that marketing is like science–there&#8217;s no failure, only learning. The trick is to learn from every effort in a manner that can inform further decisions.

Another great lesson is that while you don&#8217;t always want to reinvent the wheel, you also don&#8217;t have to use everyone else&#8217;s playbook. So many organizations have been fed a diet of media buying and advertising that they think that it&#8217;s all that&#8217;s on the menu. It&#8217;s not.

The cynical me sees this approach ranging from lazy to ass-covering (can&#8217;t get in trouble for doing what everyone else does).

I saw Louis CK in Toronto this year. We all laughed our asses off, but I get an especially warm feeling inside knowing that he sells out entire tours without traditional advertising, because he learned that he could by trying it.

What are you going to learn from your next marketing effort?
