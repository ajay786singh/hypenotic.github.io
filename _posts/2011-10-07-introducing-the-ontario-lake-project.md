For some time now much of Hypenotic&#8217;s work and our volunteer efforts have been connected to food, sustainability, travel and culture. Over the summer an idea bubbled up; what if we made promotional gear for Ontario places that people would actually want to wear or frame on their wall?

Then two critical things happened. First, we became [involved in working to stop the proposed Mega Quarry in Melancthon County][1] and in the process developed a better understanding of the food and water issues that are at stake. Around the same time we came across [Nicole Meyer&#8217;s 10,000 Lakes][2] initiative where she is creating a logo for a different Minnesota lake every day. Along the way we heard [Maude Barlowe][3] speak, watched the documentary [Flow ][4] and started to think about water a little differently.

A quick [Wikipedia search][5] revealed that Ontario has less than 10,000 Lakes, but we have enough of &#8216;em to warrant giving them the love they deserve.

This week we are starting with Lake Abitibi, the first lake in the alphabetical list. Every week we will work our way down the list creating a new logo for each lake to give you a new perspective on this amazing province we live in and the incredible resource that is water.

Enjoy!
