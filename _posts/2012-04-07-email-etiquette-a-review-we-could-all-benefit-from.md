Sorry if this is a little 101 for some of you, but I had it set as an unfinished draft, probably hastily scrabbled together when someone who should know better abused my email reading patience.

The fact is that while email is ubiquitous and benefits us in too many obvious ways to warrant a blog post, one conversation we hear about increasingly is the burden of addressing it. Email&#8217;s ease of use lends itself to careless, ignorant and deliberately layered use.

So here&#8217;s a critical piece of email etiquette that some people could benefit from. I pulled it from a great list of 101 tips. Some of them are outdated or matter less depending on your platform or situation, but I&#8217;ve grabbed one section in particular here to focus on (my comments are in [ ]):

> ## To, From, CC, BCc, RR, Subject:
> 
> 1.  Only use Cc: when it is important for those you Cc: to know about the contents of the email. Overuse can cause your emails to be ignored. [*I have 1000s unread*]
> 2.  Don&#8217;t use Return Receipt (RR) on every single email. Doing so is viewed as intrusive, annoying and can be declined by the other side anyway.
> 3.  Include addresses in the To: field for those who you would like a response from.
> 4.  Include addresses in the Cc: field for those who you are just FYI&#8217;ing.
> 5.  Make sure your name is displayed properly in the From: field.
> 6.  Remove addresses from the To:, CC; and BCc: field that don&#8217;t need to see your reply. [*BIG ONE. Unnecessary email can mean junkmail to some or just more work for others*]
> 7.  Always include a brief Subject. No subject can get your email flagged as spam. [*A good subject is like leaving a good phone message–it can help the recipient act more quickly*]
> 8.  Think about your motives when adding addresses to To:, CC:, BCc. Use your discretion. [*Many people Cc: as an ass covering measure–think about how that looks to the recipient*]
> 9.  Never expose your friend&#8217;s or contact&#8217;s email address to strangers by listing them all in the To: field. Use BCc:! [*BIG ONE. Email is private.Even if you trust the people you share  addresses with, it may make the owners of the addresses uncomfortable. Also, if enough people do this, everyone will have everyone's addresses*].
> 10. Make sure when using BCc: that your intentions are proper. To send BCc: copies to others as a way of talking behind someone&#8217;s back is inconsiderate.
