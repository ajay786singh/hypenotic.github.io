The film [Food Inc][1]. opens by dispelling the myth that grocery food comes from the idillic looking farms we often see on their packages. To the sounds of eerie music, a voice over says &#8220;Even though it looks like a tomato, it&#8217;s a *notional *tomato. It&#8217;s the *idea* of a tomato.&#8221;

The film is deadly serious about a serious issue. Food Inc.&#8217;s focus is on exposing the secrets that the food industry apparently doesn&#8217;t want us to know&#8211;like the scary places where our food actually comes from.



Food Inc. and other recent films and books have has been incredibly successful at influencing people&#8217;s thinking about where their food comes from.

It also seems to be influencing the way marketers are marketing food.<span style="font-size: 14.1667px;">Many big food companies are trying to resist being tarred by this brush. And they&#8217;re being pretty creative about it.</span>

[Dominos pizza][2] has created an entire campaign called &#8220;Behind the Pizza.&#8221; Here&#8217;s the ad promoting the Behind the Pizza website.

  
I get that this is all supposed to be funny and absurd. Not to be a buzz kill, but I&#8217;m going to take the campaign apart to understand how humour functions in the campaign.

The focus group participants are saying they want to know the source of their food, just like films like Food Inc. taught them.

The people behind Dominoes are initially made to seem highly suspect&#8211; driven around in limos with blacked-out windows like under cover agents. This is scary big food.

The iconography is over the top. But, it&#8217;s directly addressing a post Food Inc. generation, and telling the folks who worry about food that they&#8217;re simply paranoid. They use traditional folksy images of farms and farmers to make light of people&#8217;s concerns.

<span style="font-size: 14.1667px;">Dominos website <a href="http://more.dominos.com/behindthepizza/">Behindthepizza.com</a> uses the same kind of humour. At the top of each page where they invite you to explore a specific ingredient, the small print says  &#8220;There is not a Dominos actually on the farm.&#8221; Well I guess not&#8230;hardy har har.</span>

<a rel="attachment wp-att-4028" href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/4021/getting-dominos-who-gets-the-last-laugh/attachment/screen-shot-2011-01-13-at-3-44-38-pm-2"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4028" title="Screen shot 2011-01-13 at 3.44.38 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-01-13-at-3.44.38-PM1-580x412.png" alt="" width="580" height="412" /></a>

The best example happens when you click on[ step 1 of the Spinach icon][3] to view a video called *Baby Spinach: The Most Sensitive Vegetable.* This video talks about &#8220;sensitive&#8221; baby spinach that grows under a rainbow. Babies and rainbows? I think I&#8217;m going to cry. Apparently the spinach cutting machine is tended to by &#8220;warm hearted men and women.&#8221;

Listen. I get there&#8217;s a joke going on here. But the question is what kind of joke is it, and what&#8217;s its intended effect?

I would argue that while it seems like Dominoes is using irony,  they&#8217;re actually up to something more sinister.

Ironic statements are designed to &#8220;convey a meaning *exactly opposite* from their literal meaning.&#8221; Dominoes makes reference to rainbows and babies when talking about their spinach to be funny, but they still want you to associate their food with quality real food, not junk. Put another way, they don&#8217;t want you to think that there&#8217;s a scary industrial dimension to their food. Otherwise, why bother making a site like this at all?

The flavour of their humour is more like Hyperbole. Unlike irony,  hyperbole is meant to &#8220;to evoke strong feelings or to create a strong impression&#8221; even though it&#8217;s not to be taken literally. So, when you say  &#8220;The bag weighed a ton&#8221; you&#8217;re still trying to convey that the bag is heavy. Just not as heavy as a ton.

Dominoes is going over the top about their spinach and mushrooms and tomatoes  and the farmers who make them to <span style="font-size: 14.1667px;">tell everyone who cares about food to take a deep breath and chill out.</span>

But the big reason Dominoes uses hyperbole is to make fun of people who worry about farms as factories. They make it seem like what Food Inc. was saying made big food so scary was that they rely on big machines.

Dude, come on. Food Inc. was pointing to foods as factories based on them producing processed &#8220;notional food&#8221; it wasn&#8217;t about farms using big heavy machinery.

Dominoes is deliberately twisting the idea of factory farming to discredit Food Inc. and other exposés that reveal the dark underbelly of big food.

<span style="font-size: 14.1667px;">I feel like I&#8217;m teaching a semiotics class or something. Please pardon me for going all academic on you. But this is what it takes to dissect the layers going on in something as simple as a g-damned pizza campaign. </span>

<span style="font-size: 14.1667px;">This food fight is turning into very serious business. And don&#8217;t kid yourself, the stakes are very high. It&#8217;s important to watch how a film like Food Inc. impacts our culture&#8211;and how those who have the most to lose are fighting hard to maintain the status quo.</span>
