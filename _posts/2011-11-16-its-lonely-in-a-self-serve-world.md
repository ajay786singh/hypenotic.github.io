I *love* grocery shopping, but I absolutely detest doing my own self-serve check out. It&#8217;s not (just) that I&#8217;m lazy, it&#8217;s that it feels like such an empty experience. I&#8217;ve never quite understood why.

Today on my way to get groceries at [Fiesta Farms ][1](our client) the sadness I feel when bagging my own started to make sense. CBC&#8217;s Q featured New York Times columnist Craig Lambert who was talking about his article [Our Unpaid Extra Shadow Work][2].  In it Lambert talked about all of the unpaid jobs we now do that someone else did ten years ago.

Consider how self-serve gas stations, airports and grocery stores have off-loaded  tasks onto the consumer. Lambert focuses on fatigue as a consequence of all of the many extra tasks we now have to perform. But I think there&#8217;s something much bigger at stake.

Sure, I&#8217;m frustrated by the lack of service people I encounter when I&#8217;m in a store and need to ask a question. No one works in these stores anymore. They&#8217;re just there to take your money.

So why do I care? Am I looking to be pampered? Am I just spoiled?

The answer to this question was clear to me as I chatted with Sara, Lucy and Vito at the Fiesta Farms checkout counter. We were talking about Fiesta&#8217;s involvement in Movember and which male employees were and were not participating.

The banter may seem insignificant, but the human engagement and a sense of community I felt is not. In fact, it&#8217;s core to the experience of shopping at Fiesta.  As Lambert states:

> Doing things for one another is, in fact, an essential characteristic of a human community. Various mundane jobs were once spread around among us, and performing such small services for one another was even an aspect of civility.

Without the chit-chat and human engagement life is quite lonely. What used to be social tasks are now performed with nothing but the voices in your head to keep you engaged. We&#8217;re living a more and more isolated existence. Of course it&#8217;s ironic given the proliferation of social media like Facebook and Twitter, but in self-serve moments it&#8217;s palpable. <!--more-->

When we were doing our background research on Fiesta Farms we did a review of the kinds of blog posts people wrote about the store. [One, by Krista Scott Dixon][3] stood out. In her post she refers to small town grocery stores as &#8220;community hubs&#8221; and  says &#8220;fifteen years later, I am immersed in that world again, every time I step into Fiesta Farms. &#8221;

Fiesta has established a competitive advantage by *not *being self-serve (what Lambert calls a synonym for &#8220;no service.&#8221;) Other indie shops like my local hardware store make a point of circling the aisles asking &#8220;can I help you with something?&#8221;  I find that tremendously valuable. So valuable that I&#8217;m willing to pay for it. And I bet I&#8217;m not alone.

But does service have to be relegated to high-end shops like [Holt Renfrew][2] where you&#8217;ll be bombarded by salespeople falling over themselves to serve you? Or is there a market for run of the mill experiences that refuse to cave into the cost-cutting self-serve trend.

Are you willing to pay for service, or are you just fine going about your own business? Do you notice the sense of isolation that comes with a self-serve world or am I just high maintenance?
