Wall.E  featured the fictional [Buy N&#8217; Large Corporation][1] as its evil corporate giant (read: Walmart stand-in)

But these companies&#8217; names are the real deal.  Their names could either point to the fact that they&#8217;re refreshingly transparent or blatantly evil. You decide.

[GiantFood ][2]is a supermarket chain&#8211;btw, their corporate philanthropy is raising money for [cancer][3]

[ChemInc][4] is a water treatment company. Mmmm. Chemical water.

[Grim Corporation][5] sells furniture in New Jersey. Way to *not *brighten up your home.

Not surprisingly [Bogus Oil Inc.][6] has had some service complaints. Apparently they&#8217;re not very reliable.

Have you stumbled on any companies with equally revealing names? Chemical, big or untrustworthy sounding? Send &#8216;em along. Photos too!
