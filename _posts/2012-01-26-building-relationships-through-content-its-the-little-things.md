I just bought pet insurance. Of course like all kinds of insurance there&#8217;s a mental leap you have to take while your puppy is full of vim and vigor. But, I&#8217;ve spoken to enough people to believe it&#8217;s a wise investment.

You know what the best part was? This little note I got when I confirmed purchase of my monthly pet insurance plan:

> *We know that if your pet could speak they&#8217;d thank you for being a responsible pet parent and ensuring that when the unexpected occurs they will be&#8230; All taken care of.*

It&#8217;s a little corny, but it takes the sting out of the monthly draw that will be suddenly coming out of my bank account along with a whole lot of other unexpected purchases that go along with being a dog owner.

What kind of messages could you be sending&#8211;for free&#8211;when you communicate with your customers? Here are a bunch of free online exchanges that you could make the most of:

*   **404 or error pages**: When people take a wrong turn on your website, take the opportunity to feel a little less lost and ease their frustration and impatience so they stick around longer.
*   **Email address confirmation**: When people sign up for your newsletter, what kind of information are you sending them when you  confirm their email  address. Why not let people assure people they&#8217;ve made a good decision and that you&#8217;ll treat their email carefully.
*   **Friend requests:** When you send out an invitation to a friend or contact to join your social network use the message box to make them feel good about joining you. It&#8217;s just lazy to click the box without taking a moment to make it personal.

Any other ideas for free opportunities to make customers, clients and friends feel good?
