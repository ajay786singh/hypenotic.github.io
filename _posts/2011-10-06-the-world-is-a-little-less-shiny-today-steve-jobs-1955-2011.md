I am a proud Apple fangirl.  From my iPhone to my Airport my electronic and computing life is completely mac.  It is a love affair that started 7 years ago when my ex gave me the first generation iPod nano for [Christmukka][1].  Shortly after that I moved into a career with Apple retail, and that&#8217;s how I discovered [Steve Jobs][2].

When I heard he had passed away last night I [cried][3].  And I thought as I was snuffling through yet another of his [keynotes][4] at 1 in the morning, am I crazy to be reacting this way? He was a CEO of company I worked for, and someone I admired but I&#8217;d never met him. His [words][5] and [innovations][6] though had a huge impact on my life.

Before I worked for Apple I was a technophobe.  I used to date people who were computer savvy so that they would take care of my [technology][7] for me.  I had a palm trio and I used it to text, but the calendar was too confusing and I took only the occasional grainy photo.  When I started working at Apple they spent over a month training me  and getting me up to speed.  It opened up a whole new world to me and made me unafraid of technology.  Let me repeat that because I think that is at the heart of what made Steve so innovative, Apple made me UNAFRAID of technology.

After years of owning PCs and going to computer stores where I was [talked down to][8] and treated like an idiot here was a place I could learn and ask without fear.  And as an added bonus everything was pretty. This was relatable innovate technology available to most people and I got to sell it.  It was as with most jobs not without it&#8217;s flaws but I [learned a lot][9] working for Steve.  As did my co-workers and most of our customers in the [store][10].  The [Apple fans][11] who used to come in and just rave about their laptops and iPods; People who just wanted to talk about how much better Apple products had made their lives were a testament to how Steve Jobs was much more than just a CEO of a good technology company. You just don&#8217;t see that anywhere else, have you ever seen a bunch of people in Best Buy talking about how awesome their Lenovo ThinkPads are?

As a person, he was far from perfect, and he did make some mistakes with Apple but he didn&#8217;t let those failures stop him. He was incredibly savvy, inspirational, brilliant, influential and we&#8217;ll be feeling the impact of [his loss][12] for a very long time.  [Good bye Steve][13] and thanks.
