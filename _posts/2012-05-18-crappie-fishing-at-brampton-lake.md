Apparently, the fishing&#8217;s pretty crappie at Brampton Lake near Kenora. According to [Hook and Bullet ][1]if you chose to go fishing at Brampton Lake  &#8220;the crappie will be biting your maggots.&#8221;

As a marketer, I&#8217;m thinking that the Crappie fish needs a rebrand. Call me immature but I can&#8217;t help giggling when I read the following lines from websites about Crappie fishing:

> *   &#8220;Crappies are separated into two major subspecies: white and black crappie&#8230;The black crappie is easily confused with the white crappie.&#8221;[World Fishing Network ][2]
> *   &#8220;Crappies are found in thousands of lakes and rivers across the country.&#8221; [How Stuff Works][3]
> *   &#8220;On average, a full-grown crappie will measure 10 inches (25 cm)&#8221; [How Stuff Works][3]
> *   &#8220;Crappies swim in schools, so when one finds them, there will be many more.&#8221; [Freshwater Fishing Tips][4]

Anyway, I&#8217;ve got a great new tourist slogan for Brampton Lake (since the internet seems to have very little to say about it) &#8220;If you&#8217;re up for some Crappie fishing you gotta get your ass over to Brampton Lake.&#8221;
