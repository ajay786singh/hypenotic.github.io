We hope you enjoyed our little video.We made it to celebrate our commitment to paying for [Lowfoot ][1]members&#8217; energy reductions for the month of August. What does this mean? Read on.

**Why Hypenotic?**

Hypenotic began working with Lowfoot as a client. They&#8217;re a values-based business with a smart approach to reducing energy consumption, and we helped create the strategic and design foundation for their brand.

In the process of writing their strategic manifesto, a critical question emerged:

> We&#8217;re doing everything in our power to feed our ever-growing consumption habit. What would happen if we decided to kick the energy habit instead?

As we were writing the question we knew we were headed down a rabbit&#8217;s hole of inquiry that was well worth exploring.

We quickly signed up for Lowfoot, and soon after decided we wanted to be among the first companies to pay for Lowfoot members&#8217; reductions.

August seemed like the right month to pay for reductions since it&#8217;s when most of us think about turning on the A/C and leaving it on for the entire month. In fact heating and cooling are responsible for 56% of home energy use. So shutting off the A/C can make a world of difference.

The video should help you consider some more creative approaches to cooling down like making a DIY cold pack, eating hot peppers, drinking barley water and a unique breathing technique (details below).

**What is Lowfoot?**

Lowfoot&#8217;s founders Phil and Steve built a company based on the belief that the only sustainable form of energy generation is the one we control&#8211;reductions in energy use. So they pay you to kick the energy habit.

****Here&#8217;s what happens when you sign up for Lowfoot.

*   The information in your smart meter is turned into intelligence you can use to understand and control your own energy use
*   When you reduce your energy consumption you get cheques in the mail
*   You work together with a like minded community to reduce energy use and learn about how to continue using less–and earning more
*    Your own data is aggregated with data from thousands of households who together make substantial changes to their energy habits
*   It&#8217;s addictive. Gaming psychology gets you hooked on cutting down almost immediately. Like knowing how many calories you consume influences the way you think about food, being conscious of your consumption makes it uncomfortable to leave things plugged in and turned on

So go fill a sock with white rice or roll your tongue into a circle and breathe through it. But what you should do first is sign up for Lowfoot so we can pay you some of cold hard cash.
