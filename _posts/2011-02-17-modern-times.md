[The images are worth a million words.][1]

I wonder which of today&#8217;s ads people will consider sexist, racist, or inappropriate 50 years from now. Maybe they&#8217;ll even come up with new categories all together, like &#8220;too humane&#8221; or &#8220;AI-cist&#8221; (discrimination against Artificial Intelligence)

Speaking of A.I. &#8230; The technological advancements of the current era are far beyond extraordinary. One of the latest developments in Artificial Intelligence is a computer called Watson, developed by IBM to compete on Jeopardy.

&#8220;Watson is powered by 10 racks of IBM servers running the Linux operating system. It&#8217;s not connected to the internet but has digested encyclopedias, dictionaries, books, news, movie scripts and more.&#8221; (source: <http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2011/01/14/computer-jeopardy.html#ixzz1EFAjbG1w>)

During its first public appearance in Jeopardy, Watson was put to the test against the two game-show&#8217;s champions, where he proved that to err is to be non-human&#8230;
