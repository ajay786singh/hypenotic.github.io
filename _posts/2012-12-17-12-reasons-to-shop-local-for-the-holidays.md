Last June, in a post titled [&#8220;New Directions for Hypenotic&#8221;][1], I explained how our experience at the BALLE conference had refocussed our mission from manifesting a more sustainable economy to helping manifest a more generative economy.

We&#8217;ve continued to work with organizations that foster good things like MaRS (especially the Centre for Impact Investing), PARC, Toronto Public Health, et al, but we&#8217;ve taken a new step in our commitment to the city of Toronto.

It&#8217;s short notice but the group who met at the conference is piloting a &#8220;Local First Campaign&#8221; and we&#8217;ve created an infographic listing some stats around the benefits of shopping local.

Beyond the (not to be underestimated) returns of buying from people with a <a title="Move over Industrial Era. Make Room for the artisanal era." href="http://hypn.tc/R2hidv" target="_blank">care for craft</a>, there are plenty of verified long term financial and quality of life returns that come from buying from a neighbour.

Please feel free to share or print a (7MB .pdf) of the <a title="12 Reasons to Give the Gift of Local" href="http://hypn.tc/V47Bvz" target="_blank">12 Reasons to Give the Gift of Local artwork</a>.
