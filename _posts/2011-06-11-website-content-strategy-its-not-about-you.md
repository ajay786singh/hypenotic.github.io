We recently finished a content strategy session with [Planet In Focus][1]. We&#8217;re redesigning their site to serve their business goals. Strange as it may sound, it&#8217;s a new approach for them. And they&#8217;re not alone.

Over the last ten years, brands have been faced with a marketing challenge that never existed before: What content should my website have?

Most people&#8217;s knee jerk response to the question is: &#8220;All of it&#8221;. Then they set about a lengthy process of organizing everything they could say about themselves. This approach offers a few challenges off the bat:

*   It&#8217;s a lot of work, and can often bog down or be an unbearable burden on a web project. Especially since people tend to leave it until the end.
*   It can polarize stakeholders who all want to see their piece reflected on the home page
*   It doesn&#8217;t leverage the web&#8217;s key benefits over printâ€“the ability to assess people&#8217;s interest level in your content, earning the interest of more qualified leads, relevance in the eyes of search engines, etc

A brick and mortar analogy to this approach would be selling your house without &#8216;fluffing&#8217; it. Even if you never baked a day in your life, it&#8217;s worthwhile to pop some apple turnovers in the oven when you&#8217;re having an open house.

The reason is that most people aren&#8217;t interested in you, they&#8217;re interested in how their association with you can help them fulfill *their* interests. If you can help them picture themselves baking away in their new home, all the better.

Developing web site content that matters to people means starting with why they&#8217;re coming. Who do you honestly expect to come to your site and what are they expecting to find there?

From there, you can cajole them gently down a path towards your goals.
