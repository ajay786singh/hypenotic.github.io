Sometimes, it can be just as important to know who your audience ISN&#8217;T, as knowing who it is.

I&#8217;ve had two conversations with people this week that reminded me how much energy people waste worrying about the wrong audience.

One alluded to the need to avoid any visual reference to their field (photography) because it would be too challenging to use it in a way that their peers wouldn&#8217;t find cheesy. I get that sentiment–Hypenotic wouldn&#8217;t use computers in our identity materials either. The notable part is that he was concerned about looking amateurish to his peers. I explained that photographers don&#8217;t hire him. They don&#8217;t particularly recommend him. And if they did, it would be because of his studio&#8217;s unique offering, remarkable facility and his reputation, not because of some art on their web page.

The other conversation was with a painter building a site for her work. As usual, I tried to find the hook–why should anyone spend more than 2 seconds on her site? What traction could she offer that would help people stick around longer than they needed to understand that she was a painter and to glance at the aesthetic? How might a vistor identify with her, or remember her, or discuss her?

The convention in the art space is to draw from galleries–as white as possible so the work stands out. But a website isn&#8217;t a gallery. You can&#8217;t control the clutter on the reader&#8217;s desk or desktop, the resolution of their monitor, whether the sunlight is bouncing off their laptop or monitor, or if their kids are screaming at them while they&#8217;re trying to look at the work. etc. It seems to me that if you&#8217;d like your work to stick out, the least you might try is differentiating from every other artist&#8217;s website.

I understand where these sentiments come from. I have them too. I design and critique our work with a jury of my heroes standing over it. Which is of course silly. It&#8217;s great to be detail oriented and true to your vision, but if there&#8217;s one audience you really want to make an impression on, shouldn&#8217;t it be the people who might actually buy your product?

My clients aren&#8217;t Stephen Sagmeister, Milton Glaser, Saul Bass, Jeffrey Zeldman, Jason Santamaria or Seth Godin (who it happens, did indeed once give us a glowing review, but that&#8217;s another story). They&#8217;re people with expertise in completely different verticals than mine. They may or may not have years of experience assessing design deliverables.

Before you dismiss the argument by telling yourself you&#8217;re addressing both audiences, I&#8217;d suggest you spend a few minutes honestly considering what your clients have in common with your heroes. Word view? Experience? Training?

You could be wasting time and energy while overlooking opportunities to differentiate from your peers who haven&#8217;t read this post.

Good luck.
