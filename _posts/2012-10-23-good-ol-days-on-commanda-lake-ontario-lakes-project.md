  <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10031" title="Commanda_v2" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Commanda_v2.png" alt="" width="356" height="303" />This is a charming bunch of video filmed in 1963 on Commanda Lake. A glimpse inside the cottage shows folks hanging out, drinking beer and smoking (inside the cottage!). It is a glimpse into the private lives of cottage folk who actually hung out together, and seemed to be enjoying themselves immensely.
