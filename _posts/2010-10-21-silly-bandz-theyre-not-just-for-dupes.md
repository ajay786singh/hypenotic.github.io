I&#8217;ve never seen a trend move so fast. It was like watching a virtual trend-nami released into the elementary school playground.

*   <span style="font-size: 14.4px;"><strong>Week 1:</strong> <a href="http://www.sillybandz.com/">Silly Bandz</a> first spotted on a 6 year old kid who was over for a playdate</span>
*   **Week 2:** Daughters received Silly Bandz (or some variant) as a lootbag at a birthday party
*   **Week 3:** Silly Bandz confiscated by supply teacher at school for being too &#8220;distracting&#8221; and parents randomly walking up to me, asking me where to get them &#8217;cause there kid is humiliated by having none.

On the surface, today&#8217;s Silly Bandz aren&#8217;t much different that the black rubber bracelets we almost-40 year olds wore in the 80&#8242;s. And, many would think that they&#8217;re a sign that young people can&#8217;t think for themselves but are instead inclined to do whatever their pals are doing.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-3706" href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/3703/silly-bandz-theyre-not-just-for-dupes/attachment/screen-shot-2010-10-21-at-11-04-03-am"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3706" title="Screen shot 2010-10-21 at 11.04.03 AM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-21-at-11.04.03-AM.png" alt="" width="267" height="401" /></a>  
But, here&#8217;s the twist. We didn&#8217;t have [YouTube ][1]in the 80&#8242;s. So, we wore the rubber bracelets pretty much like Madge did&#8211;up and down the arm. And we were quiet about it. <span style="font-size: 14.4px;"><em>We </em>didn&#8217;t rock the boat. <em>We</em> didn&#8217;t write songs about black rubber bracelets, and <em>we </em>didn&#8217;t make movies about &#8216;em either. We simply wore them.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14.4px;">The world has changed since those black rubber bracelets were the most sought after school yard accessory.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14.4px;"> </span><span style="font-size: 14.4px;">Here are some interesting videos that feature young girls <em>&#8216;owning&#8217; </em>their Silly Bandz. All of these riveting productions show these girls adapting their Silly Bandz in ways that put their creativity, fashion sense and ingenuity to work. They provide an interesting case study on the power of YouTube in the hands of some PYT&#8217;s (That&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdV7Kb1RG8Y">Pretty Young Things</a> for those who were around when Michael Jackson was still normal)</span>

First, a tutorial from webkinzhipporocks on how to make Silly Bandz into earrings. Listen to how she says the word &#8220;Silly Bandz.&#8221; Pretty funny at the end when she tries to explain what to do with the earrings if you don&#8217;t have pierced ears.  


A DIY project where powdrpunkgrrl demonstrates how to fix a Silly Bandz by sewing with some pretty rockin&#8217; tunes in the background.



Finally, here&#8217;s prettycat2000 demonstrating a cool Silly Bandz trick&#8211;turning a Silly Bandz into an Air Balloon.



<span style="font-size: 14.4px;">So, what do you think? Is this just fetishization of brand paraphanalia, or true creativity at work?</span>
