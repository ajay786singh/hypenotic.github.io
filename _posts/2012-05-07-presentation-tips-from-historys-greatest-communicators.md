I&#8217;ve done A LOT of presenting over the last ten years. At conferences, in board rooms and informally.

I love it. But I still sweat it. Every time.

I think it&#8217;s because I believe there&#8217;s an unwritten contract between the speaker and the audience. In exchange for some considered attention, people have a right be floored. Moved. At the very least, they ned to be engaged.

I just watched a TedTalk Nancy Duarte gave a couple of years ago that&#8217;s going to make me sweat even more.

By her standards, your presentation is no less than a vehicle to help you change the world. Key ideas include:

*   Presenter isn&#8217;t the hero, the audience isâ€“presenter is the mentor, shepherding the audience from one place to another
*   There&#8217;s a rhythm to this journey, and the greatest presenters, from Dr. King to Steve Jobs have availed themselves of it

According to Nancy, you can change the world on whatever scale you need to for your idea to exist, just don&#8217;t keep your idea bottled up.
