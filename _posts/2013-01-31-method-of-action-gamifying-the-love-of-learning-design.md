[Method of Action][1] is a peer-to-peer educational website that targets three categories: Design, Entrepreneurship, and Gardening.

Each course is comprised of 50 &#8220;missions&#8221; that contain videos, articles, resources and tools that can help you accomplish your goal, and ultimately advance your knowledge of the subject at hand.

Once you&#8217;ve completed a task, you submit your results to a panel of more experienced peers who will then review it and give you a passing or failing grade. If you pass, you get points allowing you to access more challenging missions. Eventually, if you gain enough experience (exp), you&#8217;ll even be able to become part of the review panel and help others accomplish their goals in return.

The core foundation is simple really; most people learn by doing.

> &#8220;Knowledge is acquired by actually doing things and reflecting upon it. Proactively thinking about how you can improve what you did.&#8221;

MOA claims that while you can get pretty far with just doing, eventually you&#8217;re going to need someone to tell you how to get beyond what you already know. You&#8217;re going to need help setting milestones, and provide guidance on exercises to help you get there.

I think this idea is absolutely amazing. I for one know that I learn much faster if I&#8217;m actively participating. I&#8217;ve read articles and tutorials on how to code a website, but until I actually attempted a few exercises alongside what I was reading, nothing I read really stuck or made much sense.

If you&#8217;re reading this and are interested in learning more about design, or are already a designer who wants to brush up on some of those lessons we learned back in Typography 101, check out Â the following games:
