In April my friend Leanne Coppen died of [Her2][1] breast cancer.

She was only 38 and had been diagnosed only 2 years earlier. She did the 60K [Weekend to End Women&#8217;s Cancers][2] after her cancer had metastasized.  That&#8217;s a long way for anyone to walk. But for someone who had been through over a year of treatment, it&#8217;s downright incredible.  Here&#8217;s a short video of Leanne&#8217;s walk last year that was part of the orientation materials [Princess Margaret][3] makes available online:



Now, let&#8217;s put all that sad stuff behind us for a moment.

Leanne was an amazing writer who blogged about Living with Breast Cancer for [Chatelaine magazine][4]. I was recently reading her blog posts and stumbled upon a post where she wrote about going for a run in the midst of her treatment cycle. If you want to be blown away by a woman you never had the pleasure of meeting [read the post here.][5]

She was the ideal poster child for my upcoming Walk to End Women&#8217; Cancers. Because I&#8217;m a big wimp, I&#8217;ll only be walking 32K in one day, not the 60K she walked over the course of a weekend last year. If it wasn&#8217;t for her, I wouldn&#8217;t be walking at all, I&#8217;d be sitting on my couch [Tweeting ][6]or [something. ][7]

When I first started talking to people about doing the walk I envisioned I would start walking and then not stop for like a really, really long time. Kinda like [Forest Gump][8]. Then people started asking, &#8220;are you training?&#8221; and warning &#8220;that&#8217;s a long walk you know.&#8221; The kind people at work even mapped it and then told me that it was like walking to York Mills and back downtown.

At first I was taken aback. I signed up for a class at the [Running Room][9], bought new shoes, and a [book on walking][10]. I&#8217;ve been trying to walk regularly as I head towards the big day on September 11th.

But more than anything that damn blog post has kept me motivated. How could a woman who had endured rounds upon rounds of gruelling cancer treatment walk 60K and train while neck deep in shit? Well she did. And frankly she did it with a smile. And so healthy, lucky me is totally confident that I can do a measly 32K with a smile firmly planted on my face too.

And, if you can&#8217;t walk, I&#8217;m pretty confident you can donate. I know that&#8217;s pushy. But hell, I&#8217;m going to be pushy about this one.

I&#8217;ve received letters about The Weekend before and frankly ignored them. But now I know better. And so do you.
