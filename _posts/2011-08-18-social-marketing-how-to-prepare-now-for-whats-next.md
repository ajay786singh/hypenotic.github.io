It never fails. I spoke at the [American Cheese Society conference][1] in Montreal a couple of weeks ago on a strategic approach to marketing in this very social era and an intrepid attendee asked me to forecast the future.

Beware experts who tell you they can. Find professionals who are versed in what&#8217;s going on NOW. Listen to professionals who tell you we&#8217;re at the dawn of the biggest shift in the way people are influenced by media since the advent of the printing press.

Big shifts like this are invariably a double edged sword.

*   Folks profiting by the existing system will have to dig in and evolve what they do, and most people resist change.
*   On the other hand, as with the printing press, the internet and social networks, platforms, tools and new devices we connect on are putting the power of publishing and connecting around personal interests in the hands of many more people.

The only responsible answer is to help both groups understand the opportunity: Measurement.

Whether you represent a large organization with consistent, sustained and integrated marketing spend or are a personal brand feeling pressured to get involved, the promise of marketing today is that you can get feedback on your efforts. Fast. Information you can turn into insight and act on. And get feedback in a hurry.

When I publish this post, and again when it goes out as part of our newsletter, I&#8217;m going to watch for:

*   Who reads it?
*   Who shares it?
*   On what social networks?
*   What are their comments?
*   If they comment on our site, what&#8217;s the nature of the comments?
*   What opportunities do I have to thank, reward and or/connect with people who interact with it?

If you&#8217;re not creating content that&#8217;s useful to people now, you&#8217;d better be working towards it. Because while no one can guarantee what&#8217;s next, I&#8217;m pretty certain it&#8217;s only going to get easier for people to create and find content they find useful. My professional advice is to start working on a recipe for relevance today if you&#8217;d like to a part of whatever comes next.

Anything else you monitor for? Let me know.
