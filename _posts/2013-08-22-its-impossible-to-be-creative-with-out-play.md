Last week we went to Toronto&#8217;s first-ever [Figment Festival][1]. Don&#8217;t know what Figment is? It&#8217;s a weekend long, free participatory art event that, in their words is &#8220;designed to promote spontaneous collaboration, active communication and significant fun.&#8221;

There was music, art, theatre, games and&#8230;. my kids playing Aqua Attack!



Figment was started by the [Burner community][2] or folks dedicated bringing to Burning Man&#8217;s philosophy and principles to life in local communities. Burning Man is based on [ten core principles ][3]which include radical inclusion, gifting and decommodification and civic responsibility. The Toronto crew got together to make these principles come to life here.

At Figment I spent time pondering how little space there is for adult play that includes being silly, engaging our senses and interacting with others in new and creative ways.

> We&#8217;re expected to be creative and innovative in our working lives but the truth is, shy of the occasional ping pong table, there are very few outlets for adult play.

By coincidence last week I read my kids a story called [Serious Farmer ][4]about a farmer who takes his job far too seriously and constantly says things like  “Farmin’ is serious business.”  After several attempts at making Farmer Fred laugh, one day all of the farm animals up and leave the farm discouraged by their inability to crack up Farmer Fred. Finally the image of all of the farm animals running away from home gets Farmer Fred to crack a smirk and that&#8217;s enough of a hopeful sign to get the farm animals to turn-tail and go home.

What can we learn from Figment and Farmer Fred and the importance of play in our working lives?

1.  **It&#8217;s impossible to innovate without play.** If your business is rooted in creativity and innovation, you need to invest time in creating an environment that fosters those things. Sitting at a desk will only get people so far. What can you do to get people seriously having a good time to get the creative juices flowing?
2.  **No one wants to work for a sourpuss. **Sure your business is &#8220;serious business&#8221; and pays the bills. But does that mean you have to be serious all the time? How can you foster opportunities to laugh and play more with co-workers both inside the office and out?
3.  **It&#8217;s the unexpected that creates fun. **It took the sight of farm animals in the woods to crack up Farmer Fred. It took me and my family venturing to an island to throw wet stuffed animals at each other to have a different experience that brought us closer together. What kind of new and unexpected places and activities can you introduce to inspire new ideas?

This play business is serious business if you&#8217;re serious about creating a culture of innovation. What can you be doing to create fun, collaboration, communication and a culture that won&#8217;t have coworkers walking out the door?
