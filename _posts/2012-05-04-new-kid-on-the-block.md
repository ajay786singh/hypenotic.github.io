Hello there!  After finishing up my second week here at Hypenotic as the newest Graphic Design Intern, I thought it was about time to introduce myself. My name is Christopher Hebert and I am currently entering my fourth and final year at Sheridan College’s Bachelor of Applied Arts Illustration Program.

So far, Hypenotic is proving to be worthy of the early morning alarm and commute that I&#8217;ve been getting used to. I work in a downtown studio space complete with eleven large windows, my own desk (displayed below, along with things I enjoy), a smiling and talented staff, and of course, Blue, a cute Australian Sheppard that won’t let me touch him. I’ve got no complaints. Like I said, the staff are a great group of people and their mission to create meaningful marketing for good things reflects in their personalities. So, for the next couple of months, while I’m not trying to win the friendship of Blue, I am going to be building connections with my colleagues so that I can learn some new skills from them, maybe even vice versa. I hope you have a lovely Friday, and you’ll be hearing from me again soon.
