We recently got a [new sofa][1] at Hypenotic.

This is great for two reasons:

1.  We&#8217;re hoping our clients will feel more comfortable and welcome when they visit
2.  It is guaranteed to vastly improve my daily nap

Yes. I have a ritual siesta almost daily in the afternoon.

It usually kicks in around 1or 2pm. I feel sluggish, my screen starts to appear blurry and I lose all focus.

That&#8217;s when I know it&#8217;s time to give in to the sofa&#8217;s siren call.

My nap isn&#8217;t long. Only 12 minutes, generally.

And when I wake up, I feel refreshed, clear headed and I have a burst of energy to get me through the rest of the day.

Here&#8217;s three steps I take to ensure a successful nap&#8230;

### 1. Set my timer

I use the clock app that comes with the iPhone to set a count-down timerÂ I also sometimes use the [Minimalist Timer app][2]. Its simple design can be operated easily with one finger and has 3 pre-sets.

### 2. Choose a good alarm

They key thing is to make sure the alarm is something jarring, something that will pull me out of my deep slumber.

I&#8217;ve found the crickets chirping works well because it&#8217;s completely out of context for an afternoon in the office.

### 3. Keep it short

I&#8217;ve found 12 minutes is usually just the right amount of time to make me feel alert and focussed afterward. It&#8217;s long enough to enable my brain to have a little shut-off time, and short enough that I don&#8217;t get sucked into wanting to sleep the day away.

According to [this blog post][3], the benefits of napping are many. Napping can even increase your sex drive (though I suggest you wait till after work to test that one).

If you aren&#8217;t napping in the afternoon, perhaps its time to start.

And if you&#8217;re not napping because your&#8217;e afraid of what your boss will say, show them that blog post.

What boss wouldn&#8217;t want their employees to &#8220;[i][3]<span style="color: #423839; font-family: Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px;"><a href="http://www.besthealthmag.ca/embrace-life/sleep/19-reasons-to-take-a-nap">ncrease your on-the-job alertness by 100 percent?</a>&#8220;</span>
