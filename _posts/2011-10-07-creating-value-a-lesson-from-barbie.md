I threw out my daughter&#8217;s [Barbie coloring book][1] this morning while she wasn&#8217;t looking. I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s recyclable.

The thing is, as my wife and I leafed through the pages, we were dismayed that all the images were of what Barbie was wearing, the makeup in her purse and the parties she was going to.

It was all about the glamour.

We all can use a bit of glamour in our lives, of course. But it&#8217;s supposed to be the icing on the cake, not the cake itself.

What we really want to teach our four-year-old is to value the lives around her, to hold all people in esteem, and the importance of serving others. (Oh, and not talking back. But that&#8217;s another lesson entirely.)

Barbie&#8217;s colouring book is more than just a colouring book, of course. It&#8217;s a subtle piece of interactive marketing designed to build a relationship between the Barbie brand and my daughter.

It&#8217;s genius, really.

And it&#8217;s the essence of smart marketing: Creating assets of high perceived value that build trust and grow relationships with customers and prospects. Get it right and they will enthusiastically buy from you again and again.

When these assets help our prospects and clients to take action in service of the things they value, mere marketing becomes meaningful marketing.

Perhaps a timely example is the [MacBook][2]. For people who love their Macs, each interaction is a reminder of the power of good design to inspire, enable and embolden. It makes you believe you can do great work.

Once again, the product IS the marketing, and it quickly leads to needing an iPhone or an iPad or some other shiny Apple accessory.

So, sorry Barbie, you&#8217;re in the trash today. My kid has more [important marketing][3] to play with.
