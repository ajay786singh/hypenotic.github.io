  Artist Franklin Carmichael, a member of the Group of Seven has much to teach us about how to live life.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Carmichael&#8217;s painting of Cranberry Lake (1936) is a living example of the fact that you don&#8217;t have to make painful &#8220;tradeoffs&#8221; to have a successful life. Do you know the story about putting the <a href="http://michaelhyatt.com/put-the-big-rocks-in-first.html">big rocks in first</a>? The idea is that if you don&#8217;t put set aside time to attend to the real priorities in your life (let&#8217;s say family, friends, etc.), there&#8217;s a good chance you&#8217;ll never get around to them.
</p>

It appears that this was a concept that Franklin Carmichael understood and lived by.

The [Art Gallery of Ontario describes him][1] in the following way:

> Carmichael did not feel the need to paint the Arctic or Rocky Mountains as the other members did. He was a devoted family man and could not explore to the same degree as the other members. Much of his work revolves around Ontario. However, biographers also note that he was never upset with this reality, he embraced it.

We Ontarians love our lakes (and cottages) because connecting to nature reminds us of what&#8217;s important. It seems Carmichael never forgot. Perhaps this is why he is &#8220;lesser known&#8221; among the seven and was absent from the famous [1920 picture of the group taken at Toronto&#8217;s Arts & Letters Club. ][2]

I like to imagine he was busy hanging out on a hammock surrounded by his family at his cabin on Cranberry Lake while the other six were having their photo taken.
