My buddy Joshna and I decided to watch a movie. Well, to be more specific, we decided to watch[ Fiddler on the Roof][1]&#8211;a movie that strangely (being a Jewish girl) I had never seen before and Joshna had strangely (being an Indian/South African girl) had watched endlessly as a child.

We set the date and the build-up began. It started with Twitter references, but by the time the event rolled around it had become epic including a trip to [Queen Video][2] for the movie rental,  [Caplanskys][3]&#8216; smoked meat sandwiches and fabulous [Manischewitz][4] cocktails. Maybe that doesn&#8217;t sound epic to you, but you might feel differently after you&#8217;ve seen the (slap-dash) video about what happened before the Fiddler fiddled his first note.



This video shows how much &#8220;content&#8221; exists before the main event even takes place. By having a camera in hand and doing a couple of context shots, I can give folks a pretty good sense of where the evening is headed. You can do the same for your videos&#8211;which will inevitably be less exciting than the night Jodi + Joshna watched Fiddler on the Roof, but nothing can be done about that, can it?

Here are some ideas for shooting a pre-event video:

*   **Give context: **Joshna walking through the doorway, the Caplanskys sign&#8211;these all tell you where you are in the video. If you don&#8217;t have that footage you can always use transition slides (Slides that say &#8220;Then we went to get some deli&#8221; but it&#8217;s not quite as fun.
*   **Decide what is worthy of &#8216;build up&#8217; and what will be of interest to your audience. **Is it the dress rehearsal? The pre-game talk? The dressing of the room?
*   **Plan but don&#8217;t over-plan. **I couldn&#8217;t have known that the girl at the video store would be so cute and forthcoming had I not been intrepid enough to ask her a few key questions. Turns out she was awesome.
*   **Keep it short. **People have short attention spans. Stuff can be interesting, but only for so long
*   **Jazz it up.** Music is key to keeping people&#8217;s attention. It can add romance to a non-event like buying some deli
*   **Interview everyone. **Some of the answers you get will be worth keeping, others won&#8217;t. But, keep asking and talking
