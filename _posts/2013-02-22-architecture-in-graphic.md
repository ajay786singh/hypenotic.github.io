Having now gone through a relatively more intense deadline week (Hurrah!), I&#8217;ve been graciously asked to briefly write about some reflections on my experience.

I was browsing through an article Barry recommended, *Without Contrast, You&#8217;re Dead* by Nancy Bernard in a 2000 issue of *Critique*. Bernard adeptly goes over the basics of aesthetics and composition, an arsenal of elements by which graphic design may be critiqued. It was a great read; while being a graphic designer requires a level of talent, talent can only go so far without a good deal of nurturing and shaping through theory education and practice (this rings true for any vocation, really). The article spoke on the importance of contrast, scale, rhythm, balance, tension, movement, et cetera. As I read on these things and hacked away at the project I was working on, I was seeing (and feeling) a very similar array of issues and emotions between laying out a large-scale infographic as a graphic designer and laying out a floorplan as an architect (figures). To help articulate the notions I&#8217;ve decided to quickly put this comparative chart together:

I suppose the lesson of the day here is that, when it comes to aesthetics and atmosphere in relation to the organization of elements, the same rule applies. And it is by this rule regarding contrast that almost subconsciously makes a design beautiful.
