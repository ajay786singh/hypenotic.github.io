<img class="size-full wp-image-1546 alignleft" title="Screen shot 2009-11-12 at 11.02.26 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Screen-shot-2009-11-12-at-11.02.26-PM2.png" alt="Screen shot 2009-11-12 at 11.02.26 PM" width="374" height="373" />Creating a succinct statement of your company&#8217;s  purpose can seem like a tedious, unnecessary task. Typically, creating a Mission Statement involves folks holding up for days on a corporate retreat, just to come up with some useless blather that hangs on a plaque in the reception area.

Have a look at [Jonathan Adler&#8217;s Manifesto][1]. It is *not *a Mission Statement. In fact, it is the anti-Mission Statement. It is a treatise overflowing with funny, kitchy, and frankly inspiring stuff like &#8220;We believe that when it comes to decorating, the wife is always right. Unless the husband is gay.&#8221; and &#8220;We believe handcrafted tchotchkes are life-enhancing.&#8221; By the end I&#8217;m gushing and ready to proclaim &#8220;He&#8217;s right goddamn it. He&#8217;s right!&#8221;

This is exactly what a Manifesto is intended to do. In fact, the word Manifesto is Latin for &#8220;clear or evident.&#8221; In her blog post on the subject, [Jennifer Rice][2] makes the point that the Manifesto is for *everyone:* &#8220;it&#8217;s a public declaration, not something that&#8217;s limited to employees. Everyone sees it.&#8221; And as a result it doesn&#8217;t feature &#8220;vague, self-serving statements.&#8221;

Jonathan Adler&#8217;s Manifesto is bereft of corporate-speak. And, because it is makes his purpose clear, it is the perfect elixir for those cynical types. Those of us who thought that seeing Jonathan Adler and [his stuff][3] everywhere including a recently designed [Barbie Collection ][4](which he says &#8220;allowed him to finally make amends for decapitating sister&#8217;s Barbie in 1974.&#8221;) and his role on reality show [Top Design][5] made him a big, fat sell-out.

He stands for one thing and that is the first point in his Manifesto &#8220;Your home should make you happy.&#8221; His ubiquity is a reflection of his democratic approach to design. If you didn&#8217;t get it before, you sure get it after 22 pithy points. And, if you didn&#8217;t get it the first time, he hits you over the head with his [10 Commandments of Happy Chic.][6] His only use of exalted language is  his use of Thou and Thy which is entirely ironic.

Here&#8217;s what you can take from Jonathan Adler&#8217;s Manifesto:

*   **Be Clear:** Cut out any word that sounds like marketing/corporate speak. Say it like you&#8217;re talking to your best-friend
*   **Get a Personality: **Get one and infuse everything you do with that special sauce
*   **Be Audacious: **Don&#8217;t be afraid of sticking your neck out or starting a fight. At the height of the minimalism, Adler used his Manifesto to  declare minimalism &#8220;a bummer&#8221;
*   **Follow-Through:** Walk the Walk. Once you read his Manifesto you totally get why Adler sells [banana Xmas ornaments][7] and  [banana bud vase][8]s both for under $50
*   **Declare It Again and Again: **He tells you what he&#8217;s about 10 ways to Sunday. It&#8217;s all over his site, it&#8217;s in all his interviews. He&#8217;s living the Manifesto.

Here&#8217;s a list of other brands that have written kick-ass Manifestos that are great examples to look to:

*   [Chipotle&#8217;s Food With Integrity Manifesto][9]
*   Lance Armstrong [Livestrong Foundation ][10](it is also the form of a video)
*   [Bruce Mau Design Incomplete Manifesto for Growth][11]
