Want to eliminate H1N1? Invest in the most expensive, luxurious hand soap you can get your hands on. But two; one for your home bathroom and one for the office. I get my kids to hand wash by getting them excited about the soap; &#8220;look, it&#8217;s the foamy kind&#8221; &#8220;ooh pink soap.&#8221; Dreamy soap is much more enticing than Life brand antibacterial cleanser and much more likely to spur on action than scary images of flu victims. The same principles apply for all social change initiatives&#8211;it&#8217;s better to engage people than to scare the crap out of them. Fear leads to paralysis. Engagement, to action.
