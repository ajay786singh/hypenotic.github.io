So I spoke to a class of dynamic Imagination Catalysts (entrepreneur/inventors) at OCAD yesterday. I was there to talk about social media, but as usual, I needed to contextualize it in it&#8217;s marketing strategy role. I remembered one of the more important lessons I learned early on:

> The tools become useful when you have a problem to solve.

Today, the pressure to &#8216;be on social media&#8217; is overwhelming. No less because many have made a career out of teaching people to use twitter, etc&#8230;

It feels like a career in using a screwdriver.

I was an early adopter and have done oodles of experimenting, but I was most successful when I was passionate about what I was working on and these platforms solved a problem for me.

On a mission, doing research, seeking advice, building a team–social net-working platforms help you connect with like-minded peers all over the world with common interests. Sometimes, they&#8217;re great dis-intermediators and give you access to people who&#8217;s work you admire.

But until you figure out who should care about your product and why, it&#8217;s hard to know what you should be sharing, looking for and discussing in these spaces. Without focus, you don&#8217;t know what to measure.

You may accrue many followers, but you don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re the right ones. And you risk wasting either your time, your resources or your money–important concerns for any business, but critical concerns for an entrepreneur, SME or non-profit.

Resist the urge to create more hamster wheels. They&#8217;ll only make you feel worse. Instead, follow this path:

<div>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Figure out why anyone should care about what you&#8217;re doing
    </li>
    <li>
      Make a list of who those people are, on an interest level
    </li>
    <li>
      Start listening to their conversations
    </li>
    <li>
      Participate in a useful way to establish your credibility
    </li>
    <li>
      Finally, lead by creating ways for the people who could are about your mission to take part
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>

If you follow this process, you&#8217;ll find the various social networks are a boon. You&#8217;ll be grateful that they offer the platform, audiences, conversations and tools you need to move forward your agenda instead of stressed out that you need to master a new tool.
