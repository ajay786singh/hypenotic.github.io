When I heard Alex Bogusky of famed ad agency Crispin, Porter and Bogusky was [leaving the agency][1] to find work more in tune with his values, I kind of shrugged. I know a lot of people who made (and make) their fortune in ways that didn&#8217;t take impact into account. It&#8217;s an ongoing effort not to be judgemental about why many smart folks aren&#8217;t guided by their conscience until they&#8217;re good and comfy. It&#8217;s a flaw (because it turns out I&#8217;m not perfect). I&#8217;m working on it.



But I took notice of his latest effort for a few reasons, and I think you should too. It&#8217;s a video that shares a few facts about the potential effects of consuming sugary sodas regularly.

1.  It&#8217;s a pretty entertaining piece–the animation, music and messages are all swell.
2.  I fear it&#8217;s getting attention because Alex is a celebrity seemingly attacking a former client, which means this is buzz, not viral, and won&#8217;t ultimately affect perceptions. Of course I hope the fear is unfounded.
3.  It&#8217;s polarizing (polarbearingizing?). The very first comment on the Mashable post expresses the common right wing concern that we shouldn&#8217;t be attacking corporations. Rather, parents should educate their children so they might make better decisions. A measured responder helps the first commenter understand the research and psychology dollars and tactics parents are contending against.

I sincerely hope Alex is working it out and will eventually bring his full genius to &#8216;bear&#8217; helping the public see through the &#8216;be happy&#8217; screen (that he was once such a force in weaving) to more conscious consumption.

The campaign is housed on a standalone site that helps you focus on 3 actions: Watch, Share, Learn.

It&#8217;s a great focused approach. Some things I might consider to make the campaign more social include:

*   Turn the (fascinating) litany of facts (truths) into an infographic. A glance at beautiful information might hook people not quite game to engage in a 3+ minute video. These folks might arguably be an important audience as they&#8217;re outside the community of core advocates who already support the cause. And images are pretty easy to share and post on our networks and profiles.
*   Make each of the truths shareable via social networks and email. This can be done by adding subtle social sharing icons, or &#8220;share&#8221; icon that lists the sharing options on rollover.
*   Write a blog post about each of the facts (that&#8217;s commentable and shareable). These can be as rich as you like, including digging into the fact in question, interviewing people who should have thoughts on it, including experts and parents.
*   Offer a newsletter signup that gets ongoing campaign information and ideas for engaging others, highlights the efforts of campaign heros (parents and teachers, etc) in my inbox.

I guess what I&#8217;m after, ultimately, is for this to be the beginning of an important conversation, and leery of letting it become the conversation itself.

What do you think?
