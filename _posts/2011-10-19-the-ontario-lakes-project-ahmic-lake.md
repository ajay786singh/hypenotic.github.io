Ahmic Lake&#8217;s is a swimmer&#8217;s lake. And the most famous swimmer to emerge from those waters was a brainy, beautiful and eccentric distance swimmer named Marty Sinn.

<div>
  Marty learned her chops at <a href="http://www.campakomak.com/" target="_blank">Camp Ak-O-Mak</a>&#8211;a girls only competitive sports camp on Ahmik Lake. Ak-O-Mak&#8217;s unofficial camp motto was &#8220;Lady, if you want your daughter to sew beads on a belt, send her somewhere else.&#8221; And Marty wasn&#8217;t your average &#8216;lady.&#8217;

<div>
  A <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1076274/index.htm">1964 edition of Sports Illustrated </a> pointed out Sinn&#8217;s eccentricity: &#8220;At Ak-O-Mak she is forever wandering about like Hamlet with her nose in a book. Two days before the race she was lounging on the sun deck with a copy of <em>Mad</em> magazine and a well-chewed paperback edition of <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>.&#8221;

  In fact, Marty went on to say:
</div>

> <div>
>   &#8220;I&#8217;m suspicious of people who are terribly gung-ho about all phases of athletics—diet, sleep. I eat chocolate ice cream before a race, blueberry pancakes and chocolate cake&#8230;I&#8217;m a little critical of people who train so intensely—they become machines instead of people, they become masochists. I just don&#8217;t believe in it. It&#8217;s detrimental to your character later, naturally, and to the sport, too. Obsessions can become vicious. You get so wrapped up, you lose perspective. I think parties are important, for instance. Sometimes I won&#8217;t have anything to drink, but sometimes I really get in the bag.&#8221;

  Parties didn&#8217;t stop Marty from finishing second in the 24K CNE Lake Ontario Swim in 1963 and from being the first woman to complete the 36K &#8220;Around the Island Swim&#8221; in Atlantic city in 1964.

    Camp Ak-O-Mak is still alive and well on Ahmic Lake. Together with its boy&#8217;s camp (also on Ahmic) it has trained over 60 men and women to be Olympians.
