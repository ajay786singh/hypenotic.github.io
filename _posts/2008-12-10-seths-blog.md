Seth says social media matters because paying attention to your vocal fringe can give you insight into what&#8217;s coming and a chance to please the people you want to:

> &#8220;The noise makes it far easier than it has ever been before to hear the thunder in the distance, to get early indications of what the fringes of the market are about to spread to the rest.&#8221;
