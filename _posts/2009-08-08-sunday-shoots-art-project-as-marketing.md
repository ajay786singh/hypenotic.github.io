[Seamus Ryan&#8217;s Sunday Shoots][1]

Actually noticed this in the new copy of <a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f8000000000459632" title="Dwell (magazine)" rel="homepage" href="http://www.dwell.com">Dwell</a> Magazine and decided to check it out.

Seamus lets people know what thematic style he&#8217;s setting up for each week and invites the public to show up for portraits.

As long as you&#8217;re OK with the public ordering prints of you (though it&#8217;ll likely only be your relatives),<!--more-->

</p>

and assuming you like the theme, it looks like a great <a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f80000000001db80e" title="Marketing strategy" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_strategy">marketing strategy</a>.

Subjects are happy to have creative and pro portraits.  
The effort is noteworthy enough for Dwell Magazine to pick up on it and for me to stop and read it.

It&#8217;s share-worthy–I mentioned it to a couple of photographers right away and am mentioning it again here.  
I bet the the subjects are sharing the story and url over dinner and facebook.

I&#8217;d suggest more social features on the site itself, so people could comment on shots, submit ideas for shoots, etc.

In the meantime, Harrod&#8217;s, The V&A and others like the idea too. Seamus&#8217; blog mentions the various incarnations the gig has been/will be recreated in.

Nice.
