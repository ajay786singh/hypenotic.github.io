I don&#8217;t know about you, but I&#8217;ve always loved watching football movies. There&#8217;s a common element in every single one of them that makes the entire movie worth it. Sorry football fans, I&#8217;m not referring to the final game where the underdog wins, I&#8217;m talking about the *pep talk*.

Every football movie has them. It&#8217;s that scene where the coach gives the team a beautiful speech, typically accompanied by some very inspiring music. Is it cheesy? Absolutely. But I always find myself loving every single minute of those scenes ([Rudy][1], anyone?).

People are so receptive to these pep talks. They make you think about what drives you. It instills a sense of trust and confidence in yourself, and of those around you. And, not surprisingly, self reflection is a huge part of the learning and growing process. Unfortunately, in such a busy world, it&#8217;s typically one of those things that tend to fall off the radar.

Thankfully, for those of you who aren&#8217;t really into the whole football movie thing, [Soul Pancake][2] has released an amazing video that puts all football coach speeches to shame, while still giving you that &#8220;I need to go do something great!&#8221; feeling.

*Bonus: It&#8217;s also one of the cutest things you&#8217;ll see all day.*
