I went to a [Social Media Week ][1]event at [J.Walter Thompson][2] called [Social for Social Good][3]. It was basically on how the power of social change ideas is being accelerated by social media tools.

A not-so-great talk was topped off with an awkward conversation at the end of the event. Please, indulge me because I think it exemplifies what happens when old thinking crashes headlong into new ideas.

Pretty skinny blonde advertising type working the event approaches.Â She asks &#8220;did you like it?&#8221;&#8211; meaning did I like the event.

&#8220;Yeah, it was good&#8221; I say, reaching for a morsel of fresh fruit. It wasn&#8217;t very good. But I don&#8217;t want to talk about it. Not now and not with her.

She asks &#8220;Do you* have *Twitter?&#8221; The way she asked tipped me off that this was not going to end well. I would ask someone &#8220;Do you Tweet?&#8221; not &#8220;Do you have Twitter?&#8221; Sorry, I&#8217;m being a snob but it didn&#8217;t sound right.

&#8220;Yes, I have Twitter&#8221; I say back.

&#8220;You should Tweet.&#8221; She says. And I know *exactly* what she means. She wants me to Tweet about how great the event was. So she&#8217;s being assertive and encouraging me to do just that. She&#8217;s being an advertising type.

I play dumb on purpose replying &#8220;I DO Tweet&#8221;

She looks confused [pause] &#8220;You should Tweet that you liked it&#8221;

I guess she didn&#8217;t realize that if the experience shareworthy, I would share it. It&#8217;s Social Media Week for goodness sakes. Every person in the room had some kind of device in their hand. You don&#8217;t need to ask me to Tweet.

In fact, it&#8217;s kinda like asking someone to make out with you after a date. Either you do or you don&#8217;t. But you don&#8217;t ask.

Needless to say me and my grapes moved on from JWT. I was relieved to find some fresh air on the other side of the door on a cold February day.

And there you have it. My taste of Social Media Week 2011.
