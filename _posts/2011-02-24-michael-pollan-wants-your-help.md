  Hi &#8211; I just told Michael Pollan what my food rule is. He&#8217;s writing a new edition of his book, and has asked for our input. <p />
  Check out his email below &#8211; you could win a signed copy, or even have your rule appear in print! 
  <p />

  Hi, 
  <p />
  Last year I published Food Rules, a short book offering 64 rules for eating well. Food Rules struck a chord with many people, who found that it helped them navigate what has become a treacherous food environment, whether in the supermarket or restaurant. Many of the rules were submitted by readers, and since publication I have received a number of excellent new ones. 
  <p />
  So I’ve decided to publish an expanded edition, with additional rules and also illustrations, which the painter Maira Kalman has agreed to create. I hope you’ll consider contributing to the new book. 
  <p />
  What are some of your food rules? I’ll pick 3 submitted by people within the Slow Food network to receive signed copies of the book. 
  <p />
  Let me know your food rule here: 
  <p />

  Thanks in advance for your help,
  <br />Michael Pollan <p />
  PS the deadline for submission is February 27th
