In their brilliant book [Made to Stick][1], authors Chip and Dan Heath talk about the importance of concreteness in standing out. Creating a mental picture of your ideas, in other words &#8220;show us don&#8217;t tell us.&#8221; I&#8217;ve seen two small examples of this for values-based brands.

The first is from [Not Far From the Tree][2], a local organization that picks fruit from homes and public spaces and divides the pickin&#8217;s between the home&#8217;s owner, NFFTT volunteers, and local community organizations. For them, it&#8217;s all about pounds of fruit. On Twitter, and other their website, they always feature how many pounds of fruit they&#8217;ve collected and compare it to last year&#8217;s amount. This year, their volunteers picked 8,315 pounds. Sound like alot. I think. The next challenge would be to demonstrate what 8135 pounds looks like&#8211;is it 26 sumo wrestlers? is it a small elephant? Is it all the apples that Loblaws sells in a year? Telling me this would make the abstract number of pounds  more concrete. Making it concrete would make me more impressed, more moved, more likely to donate, volunteer, spread the word, etc.

Another organization who is striving to make their impact more concrete is a car sharing service [PickupPal.][3] Pick up pal connects people so they can carpool eachother to various destinations.  On their homepage, PickupPal feature key stats including a key statistic that they&#8217;ve diverted  38,294,908 lbs of CO2 from the atmosphere. Again, I&#8217;d ask, what does that much CO2 mean? Is it the amount of CO2 emissions by a small country like Latvia (I&#8217;m making this up), is it one Detroit car factory for 3 months? It would be helpful to know.

Check out this short, funny video where Dan Heath demonstrates what he means by [concreteness][4] when he talks about standing out in the online dating world, and how people looking for love miss a key opportunity when they introduce themselves with a lame headline like &#8220;looking for love.&#8221; Another way the Heath&#8217;s make their idea of concreteness more *concrete* is on their [blog][5] where they offer an example of a six year old doing his math homework. Instead of using abstract figures, a genius parent uses candies, and *blam!* her kid turns into a math wiz. Why? Because, as the kid proclaims, “I’m thinking of candies, Mommy.”

So, the challenge is how can you turn numbers into candies? How can you stand apart. If you figure this out, I promise you, the results will be sweet.
