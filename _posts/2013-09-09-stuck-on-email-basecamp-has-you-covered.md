If you&#8217;re working with Hypenotic on a project, you&#8217;ll likely have encountered <a title="Basecamp" href="http://basecamp.com" target="_blank">Basecamp</a>, by 37signals.

We put all of our projects there because it&#8217;s a great collaborative space for both clients and [Hypenotic][1] team members to chime in when there are decisions to make and problems to solve.

It&#8217;s also a wonderful central place to hold all the assets on a project, such as pictures, pdfs, and other files, so you don&#8217;t have to perform mind-bending feats of boolean searchery to locate revision 8 (final, I promise.) of your website copy that legal finally approved back in late April (or was it early March?).

All that said, many clients&#8217; work cultures are so embedded in the inbox that the idea of learning to use a tool other than email to manage project communications is a stretch.

Happily, Basecamp has you covered.

When someone includes you in a discussion on Basecamp, a notification is sent to your inbox. You need only hit reply to have your two cents added to the discussion.

What&#8217;s more, each project has a unique email address, so you can forward emails, share file attachments, start a discussion or create a to-do list in Basecamp, all from the air-conditioned comfort of your inbox.

The good folks at <a title="37signals" href="http://37signals.com/" target="_blank">37signals</a> have created this super-short (1 minute, 1 second) tutorial to show you how to email your content to Basecamp.



As you&#8217;ll see, it&#8217;s easier and more convenient than drive-through banking (for starters, you don&#8217;t need to remember where you parked your car). And it could be just the thing to bring some sanity back to your project &#8212; *without* having to change your email habit.

Still need help? Feel free to call us anytime or check out <a title="Basecamp's help section" href="https://basecamp.com/help" target="_blank">Basecamp&#8217;s help section</a>, chock full of faq&#8217;s, minute-long videos and guides.
