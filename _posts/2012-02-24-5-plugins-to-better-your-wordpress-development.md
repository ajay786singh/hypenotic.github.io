Everyone needs a hand or two when it comes to developing your own WordPress themes. These plugins can make that process a little easier whether it&#8217;s by filling in missing functionality or by doing some sorely needed clean up in just a few clicks.

#### [1. WP Optimize][1]

Every so often with all the wordpress updates and maintenance that your database becomes a little slow and messy. This plugin helps you to keep your database clean by removing post revisions and spams in a blaze. allows you to rename your admin name also. Additionally it allows you to run optimize command on your wordpress core tables (use with caution).

#### [2. Velvet Blues Update URLs][2]

Did you move your site to another URL and all the images in your wordpress installation are broken? Well, this handy plugin does a quick URL replace. You can choose to replace urls in only page content, in attachements, as well as a variety of other options without you having to write any database queries.

#### [3. WP PHP widget][3]

&#8220;This plugin adds a new widget called PHP Widget, which will allow you to include PHP code, you can have Text, HTML, Javascript, Flash and/or PHP code wordpress template tags as content or title in this widget. So, as long as you want, it can do everything, that is greatful.&#8221;

#### [4. WP Page Navi][4]

The paging system that comes with wordpress by default isn&#8217;t very flexible. WP Page Navi provides &#8220;a more advanced paging navigation interface&#8221;. So you can easily replace &#8220;Next Page â†’&#8221; with a more intuitive page numbering system.

#### [5. Clean Options][5]

Let&#8217;s face it, we all install and uninstall tons of plugins in an attempt to come up with an amazing wordpress site. The unfortunate thing is that some plugins leave behind a bunch of junk inside your database tables. With this handy plugin you can clean up orphaned plugin data and free up some space!
