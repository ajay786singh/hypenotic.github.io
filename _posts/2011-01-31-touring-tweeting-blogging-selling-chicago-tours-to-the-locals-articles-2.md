This Chicago marketing associate got it right. People don&#8217;t want to communicate with nameless, faceless brands. Don&#8217;t worry about &#8216;polish&#8217; and don&#8217;t be too sales-y. Truth is, you&#8217;ll be more successful if you&#8217;re just yourself.

> “It was important to show a real person and have a certain kind of genuineness in my tweets,” Lucente says. “You can’t get away with having your tweets go through an approval process. People can see right through that. Sometimes I’m funny, sometimes I’m nerdy, sometimes I’m boring, sometimes I’m super-architectural, and sometimes I’m super-Chicago.”
