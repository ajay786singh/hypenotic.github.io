Confession: I&#8217;ve always struggled to set big picture goals.Â But, when I do set my sites on something, my focus is so intense that nothing can stop me.

Hey, If you want to get somewhere, you&#8217;ve got to know where you&#8217;re going, right?

Often business owners want to know the number of visitors to their site. They count up &#8216;likes&#8217; on facebook and followers on twitter and are thrilled to watch their numbers go up.

Here&#8217;s the thing, though: The point of all the metrics is not to make you feel good because a million people like you.

The point is to help you determine whether you are reaching your goals online, so you can tweak your efforts to better achieve them.

You do have goals, don&#8217;t you?

Let&#8217;s say you want to sign up a 100 new subscribers to your newsletter this month.

Knowing how many people come to your site each day, and how many of those people sign up for your newsletter tells you how many people are &#8216;converting&#8217; from visitors to subscribers. And how long it&#8217;s going to take you to hit your goal of 100 subscribers.

This is called a &#8216;conversion rate&#8217;. And armed with this information, you can work on&#8230;

*   improving the calls-to-action on your site (sign up for our newsletter now, dammit!)
*   tweaking your design to make your newsletter more obvious (over here, over here!)
*   improving the content you are using on blogs and facebook (to name a few) to entice people to come to your site in the first place (are you being helpful and useful?)

Successfully doing these things and more, could enable you to hit your goal faster and even set your sights higher.

Someone once said, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t know where you&#8217;re going, you&#8217;re sure to get there.&#8221; The same is no less true online.

Unless you know the outcomes you want to achieve, how can you be sure you&#8217;re succeeding?
