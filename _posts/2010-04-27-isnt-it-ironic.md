The organization Magazine Publishers of America has banned together with five of the most powerful magazine publishing companies in the US (including heavy hitters like Condé Nast and Hearst Magazines) to fight what they c[all misperceptions about the magazine readership][1] that are leading to dwindling ad revenue. In all of this, the internet is positioned as good, but not *that good. *And those who praise the internet as the death knoll for magazines as full of hot air.

So, the publishers have launched a pretty powerful print campaign. And they kicked it off with this little video (on YouTube of course)



Even though the You Tube video you watched above *does not allow comments (*how not to use the internet*) *A number of  bloggers, like Evan Schnittman from [Black Plastic Glasses][2] have lined up to  poke holes in every single factoid the magazine industry presents.

* *I&#8217;m guessing the real power of print is that it doesn&#8217;t talk back. But, the magazine industry overlooked that they can&#8217;t control the conversation no matter how hard they try.
