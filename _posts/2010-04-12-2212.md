A trip to their [Downtown store ][2]embodies the power of living a single idea, simply expressed. Lee Valley sells high quality woodworking and gardening tools and that&#8217;s all they sell. I had an impending kids&#8217; birthday party on my mind as I roamed the aisles, and I was delighted to be *disappointed* by the absence of kids&#8217; stuff.

Lee Valley is not in the kids&#8217; toys business. If fact they have a decidedly adult approach to craftsmanship.  The long-term benefit of being known for one thing outweighs the short term bang of selling a few cheap kids&#8217; gardening or woodworking toys. In the must-read book [Rework][3], the authors have a chapter dedicated to the importance of being a curator:

> It&#8217;s the stuff you leave out that matters. So constantly look for things to remove, simplify and streamline

That&#8217;s great advice for brands in general. How many messages are you trying to cram into a single ad? What are you talking about in your blog post? Why do people come to your store?

Last week, [Seth Godin][4] wrote a brilliant blog post about the appeal of artisanal products/services in response to decades of conspicuous consumption. The trend (hopefully it&#8217;s not just a trend) is captured by Godin saying it&#8217;s all about &#8220;spending on and investing in *time*, not stuff.&#8221;

It takes *time *and frankly love to curate. Not being able to curate is like being a hoarder. You&#8217;re so afraid to let go. Why?  Because you&#8217;re afraid to fail. What if someone shows up and I don&#8217;t have what they want? Guess what, that&#8217;s good news. As the Rework Authors state

> You don&#8217;t make a great museum by putting all the art in the world into a single room. That&#8217;s a warehouse.

Don&#8217;t be a warehouse. A warehouse is generic, difficult to navigate, and impossible to be emotionally connected to. Here are a few examples of folks who have succeeded by curating, focusing and bringing lightening precision to their passionate endeavor.

*   [Cherry Bomb][5] in Roncesvalles. They just serve awesome coffee and biscotti and get people to line up out the door.
*   [The Drake General Store ][6]Their idea of vintage and modern whimsy is so clear, they opened a store in Rosedale where there&#8217;s no Drake Hotel in sight
*   [Seth Godin][4]&#8216;s blog offers single idea marketing tips that help people stand out, not &#8216;fit in&#8217;
*   [Blo Bar][7] No colour, no cuts, not even trained hairstylists. Just a blowdry for $35. I like it
