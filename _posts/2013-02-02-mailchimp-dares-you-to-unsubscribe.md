The most recent email I received from [MailChimp][1] sported a feature I hadn&#8217;t noticed before. Perhaps it was new. It was definitely bold.

What was it?

Only the biggest freakin&#8217; unsubscribe link I&#8217;ve ever seen.

Check it out:

<div id="attachment_10470" style="width: 475px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <img class="size-full wp-image-10470 " alt="MailChimp's big, bold, unsubscribe link" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/mailchimps-big-usub-link2.png" width="465" height="175" /><p class="wp-caption-text">
    MailChimp dares you to unsubscribe
  </p>
</div>

That&#8217;s BIG.

Most newsletters bury their unsubscribe links among administrivia like your mailing address or how you got on your list (I realize these are required by law in some jurisdictions).

The reason is obvious: Most senders of newsletters don&#8217;t want you to unsubscribe.

So, why would MailChimp do this? Could it be because they don&#8217;t care if you unsubscribe?

That could actually be quite liberating.

If you didn&#8217;t care whether people unsubscribed from your list you could&#8230;.

*   Break free of your impersonal marketing-speak rut and write content that aims to really connect with people
*   Use your newsletter to experiment with new content ideas and learn from the feedback
*   Spam your list to death and engender a lot of bad will

Okay, that last one is not something to strive for.

Given their clever use of the first two, I&#8217;m convinced MailChimps DOES care about their faithful following.

But here&#8217;s a thought&#8230;

Perhaps MailChimp&#8217;s years of email experimentation have taught them there&#8217;s a lot to be gained by eliminating the friction unsubscribing. Beyond compliance issues, consider that&#8230;

*   Good will is engendered when your readers feel you respect them enough to leave on their terms
*   Unsubscribes are a form of feedback; You can learn from them what resonates with your community (and what doesn&#8217;t)
*   Your emails should draw prospects closer to doing business with you; If they&#8217;re not interested in hearing from you, maybe they&#8217;re not a good fit

Marketing is not for the timid. It takes courage to step out boldly and develop your own voice. You won&#8217;t please everybody; nor should you try. Unsubscribes are one valuable source of feedback.
