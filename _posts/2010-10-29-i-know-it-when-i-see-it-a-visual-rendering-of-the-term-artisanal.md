This week, [a great rant on the term ][1]*[Artisanal][1][ ][1]*was posted by the food editor of my new favourite blog [Grist][2].  Here are a few choice words [Bonnie Azab Powell][3] had about food products claiming to be &#8220;artisanal&#8221;:

> Artisanal once described something meaningful, honoring the labor of people who make things very skillfully, with their hands. By now, it&#8217;s just an emptied-out, hollow marketing term, like &#8220;fresh.&#8221; And things have gotten absurd.

It&#8217;s true. Terms like &#8220;organic,&#8221; &#8220;sustainable,&#8221; and &#8220;artisanal&#8221; have been so abused by food companies that they&#8217;re now virtually meaningless.

But then again, sometimes language adds a layer of complexity that gets in the way of our own basic &#8220;I know it when I see it&#8221; intuition.

<span style="font-size: 14.1667px;">They say a picture&#8217;s worth a 1000 words. So while everyone&#8217;s busy writing up Manifestos on the meaning of artisanal,  I thought it&#8217;d be best to show some images of Dawn Woodward from <a href="http://evelynscrackers.com/">Evelyn&#8217;s Crackers</a> that demonstrate her dedication to her craft. </span>

Dawn and Ed describe their crackers as &#8220;handcrafted from artisanal, organic ingredients.&#8221; No matter how you define artisanal, their crackers fit the bill.

How do I know? Have a look at some photos I snapped at our meeting this morning. These are most definitely living examples of the &#8220;I know it when I see it&#8221; methodology at work.

</p>

<span style="font-size: 14.1667px;">These are a true baker&#8217;s arms. Notice the burn marks? Someone once asked Dawn if she was a cutter. But these kinds of burns are par for the course when you bake your own crackers. Owners of big cracker factories don&#8217;t typically get these. Know what I&#8217;m saying?</span>

</p>

<span style="font-size: 14.1667px;">Dawn is extremely dedicated to her craft. How dedicated you ask? Well, dedicated enough to have wheat, that&#8217;s right, wheat tattooed on her back.</span>

<a rel="attachment wp-att-3740" href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/3735/i-know-it-when-i-see-it-a-visual-rendering-of-the-term-artisanal/attachment/photo-7"><img class="size-full wp-image-3740 aligncenter" title="photo-7" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/photo-7.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="480" /></a>

At one serendipitous moment at the end of our meeting with Dawn and Ed, the [Ritz ][4]cracker truck went speeding by. We caught Dawn standing in the foreground with the Ritz truck behind.

You&#8217;ve heard of Ritz, that little cracker company owned by[ Kraft][5]? I think it&#8217;d be safe to say their crackers aren&#8217;t artisanal in any sense of the word. How can you tell? Just check out the size of their truck. It&#8217;s a dead giveaway.
