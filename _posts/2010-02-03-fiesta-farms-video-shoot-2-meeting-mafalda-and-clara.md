<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1877" title="Clara" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Clara-210x130.jpg" alt="Clara" width="210" height="130" />Today, I had the pleasure of meeting Clara and Mafalda; an Italian Toronto mother and daughter who allowed us to video them making stuffed artichokes for the [Fiesta Farms website. ][1] They were warm, and lovely, and had an amazing rapport that had us all in stitches. Again, we were served an amazing lunch and even a glass of white wine. What a life I&#8217;m living.

For the second time in two days of shooting, I was surprised to walk into the home of a supposed &#8220;granny&#8221; to discover that her home was more stylish than my own. When I think of a  &#8220;granny&#8221;, I think of my own grandmother whose house overflowed with chachkas, photographs and old fashioned, wood trimmed furniture. Clara&#8217;s home did not stink of moth balls. In fact, she had all the latest modern stainless steel appliances and a television set bigger than I&#8217;ve ever seen.

<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1889" title="granny" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/granny-210x130.jpg" alt="granny" width="210" height="130" />I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m surprised. My 60 and 70-something parents are pretty hip and live in a swanky condo. It seems [granny chic ][2]is only the rage for us 40 somethings who only have faint memories of plastic covered furniture and giant coloured glass ashtrays from our own grandparents. Here&#8217;s some evidence of the fact that granny chic is a real, and growing trend:

*   Flickr&#8217;s [granny chic page][3] has over 1,500 photos
*   [Etsy, t][4]he three year old online craft store sold $27 million in goods last year
*   Popular blogs like [decor8 ][5]are bringing granny chic to a whole new level

What to make of our longing for our grandmother&#8217;s aesthetic?  If 60 is the new 40, then 40-somethings are missing the ol&#8217; fashioned comfort of their granny&#8217;s house. All those Lululemon-ed grannys are making us nostalgic for the feel of fur coats and a Chanel Number 5. If I were a psychologist, I&#8217;d say we&#8217;re filing that void by decorating our homes with nostalgic reminders of time gone by. Oh Granny, where art thou?
