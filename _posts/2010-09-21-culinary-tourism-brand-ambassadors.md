When I was 19, I backpacked across Europe with four friends. Thank goodness my trip pre-dates the internet; that summer doesn&#8217;t belong on Facebook.

I hopped over to Israel from Greece to meet relatives I&#8217;d never met. Israel was fascinating on many levels, but this is about a bad experience. $400 in Traveller&#8217;s Cheques were stolen at my hostel in Tel Aviv. When my cousin caught wind of the news, he came straight over and insisted I take $400 from him. He could have loaned me $50 to get by or bought me a couple of beers to help me get over it, but he was adamantly committed to doing his part to improve my memory of his city. And he did.

Tel Aviv didn&#8217;t know it, but they had a brand Ambassador in my cousin Benny.

I just got off the plane from Halifax this weekend where I had plenty of opportunities to think about brand ambassadors for places. I was presenting at an event called &#8220;One World One Table&#8221;, hosted by [ICTA][1] (The International Culinary Tourism Association) and [Taste of Nova Scotia][2]. I met Food Inc. Producer/Director Robert Kenner and his charming wife Marguerite, Celebrity Chef + P.E.I. ambassador Michael Smith, and a lot of really interesting folks from 16 countries.

> I also had a brand ambassador experience that stamped a first impression on me that will forever make Nova Scotia a place I look forward to getting back to, exploring more of, and telling other people about. But it didn&#8217;t happen at the conference.

Doug Townsend ([@DouglasTee][3]), Director of Marketing for Taste of Novia Scotia and his wife Renée Lavallée ([feistychef.ca][4]) showed us such an intimate, convivial, informative and delectable experience that I left thinking hospitality was endemic to the culture.

I&#8217;d had a few interactions w/Renée on twitter ([@feistychef][5]), and a few more with Doug after the two or three strategy phone calls I had with the ICTA and Taste teams as they planned the event. But that was enough for Doug to pick us up at the airport, meet us at Halifax&#8217;s swell new [Seaport Market][6], lend us a car to visit [Lunenberg][7] and [Chester][8] and to host us for dinner. Did I mention Renée is a Chef?

Both Doug and Renée were busy as all hell between two kids and high-alert conference responsibilities. But writer Stephanie Ortenzi ([@stachio][9]), Rebecca LeHeup ([@OntarioCulinary][10]) and Noelle Munaretto from OCTA + Jodi and I were treated to local cheese (Dragon&#8217;s Breath of course) and other treats Renée and Doug picked up at the market.

We chatted standing in the kitchen while Doug shucked oysters and poured [Propeller beer][11].

Renée concocted clams and scallops around us (never had scallops in the shell before). She handled harpooned swordfish, and served two of the best salads I&#8217;ve ever had, composed of, again, fresh fare from local producers picked up Saturday AM at the market.

As you might imagine, the only way to wrap a visceral experience like this was with a crack cocaine level sensorial hit in the form of a salt-baked pear drizzled and sitting in home made caramel. So we did.

As if that wasn&#8217;t enough, Chef Craig Flinn ([@craigcooks][12]) hosted us at Chives Canadian Bistro. That experience could be a chapter in a book about the senses. Suffice it to say that he was more than an amazing host, the impression he created transcended the heavenly meal. He walked us through each course, shared wine from his personal stock, answered questions and then let us buy him a drink at a pub down the road.

And speaking of drinking, I headed out with the team from Taste of Nova Scotia on Monday night and ended up sitting next to another multi-talented ambassador for Nova Scotia–Chef Michael Howell ([@MHowellGTC][13]), owner of [Tempest][14]. We talked for two hours straight and it turns out we&#8217;ll be continuing the dialogue at Slow Food&#8217;s Terra Madre in Torino.

I&#8217;m not sure what brand &#8220;messaging&#8221; could have made an impression on me that would be as significant as the one created by the Diplomats I met over my five day visit. As a professional who&#8217;s conscious of these things, it seems like the needle Nova Scotia is moving in the world is about &#8216;hospitality&#8217; and that just about anyone there is empowered to move it forward in their own way.

Thanks to all for the experience, the memories and the lesson in modern brand strategy.
