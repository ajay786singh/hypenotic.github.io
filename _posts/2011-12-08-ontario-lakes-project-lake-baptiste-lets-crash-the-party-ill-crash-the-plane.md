When Ed Robertson, one of the Barenaked Ladies, crashed his float-plane Cessna 206 into Bancroft&#8217;s Lake Baptiste way back in 2008 it turned out to be a pivotal moment for the band. The crash, coupled with other unfortunate events helped bring the band together. Speaking about the band&#8217;s album [All in Good Time][1] Robertson said:

> The writing was cathartic for me in a way that writing hadn&#8217;t been since the early nineties. It had been a huge and often dark year: an arrest, a plane crash and the death of my mother. All of these things took a heavy toll on my psyche, and spurred a lot of serious exploring.‚Äù

  In fact, the Lake Baptiste crash inspired Robertson to write the following lyrics from the song <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkDv3MLHuyo" target="_blank">The Love We&#8217;re In </a>
</div>

> <div>
>   Less heart to heart, and more brain to brain<br /> If you&#8217;re feeling tender, I&#8217;m Novacain<br /> Lets crash the party, I&#8217;ll crash the plane
> </div>

  We&#8217;re certainly glad the Cessna passengers emerged unscathed, and that one of our favorite Canadian Bands emerged better than ever.
