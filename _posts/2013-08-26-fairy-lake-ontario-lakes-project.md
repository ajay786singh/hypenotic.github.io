Hypotheses on the etymology of Fairy Lake:  
The first, and most obvious guess is that the name is an ode to the size of the lake. Fairy Lake is a mere, 1757 acres. Then again, the lake might be named in reference to the nearby town of Muskoka. Just the sort of quaint and friendly place that might set the scene for the beginning of a great fairytale&#8230;probably one that involves a lot of fish. Alright, that one was a little far fetched&#8230;. More farfetched still is the hypothesis that the trails around the lake offer a variety of activities from hiking to cross country skiing and was thus named after the active and sprightly Fairy. Following this somewhat irrational train of thought, maybe the lake was named after a fictional creature wrought by the human imagination because the lake too, was wrought by human hands. I guess we&#8217;ll just have to settle with the hypothesis that the elusive nature of fairies (which must be the reason no one has proven their existence) is the inspiration behind this elusive lake&#8217;s namesake.
