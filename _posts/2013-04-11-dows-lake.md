If you&#8217;ve ever visited Ottawa, chances are that you will recognize this lake. A man-made lake serving as a flooding control device for Rideau Canal, Dow&#8217;s lake is a cultural hub with family-friendly events and activities happening year-round, including canoe and paddleboat rentals, skating on the Rideau, and the famous annual Winterlude and Canadian Tulip Festival. Flanked by the Queen Elizabeth Driveway, a pavilion of restaurants overlooking the water, and Carleton University, Dow&#8217;s Lake makes for a versatile scenic pastime venue.
