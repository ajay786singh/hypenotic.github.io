<a rel="attachment wp-att-3850" href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/3846/ba-de-ya-dancing-in-movember/attachment/hypenotic_movember_badge-5"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3850" title="Hypenotic_movember_badge" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Hypenotic_movember_badge4-250x250.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" /></a>We came. We saw. We &#8216;stached.

Last night&#8217;s [Great Canadian Moustache Party][1] was the result of good old fashioned team work; Hypenotic brought design + social media chops, [Mildred&#8217;s Temple Kitchen][2] brought incredible food, atmosphere and service, [The Baitshop][3] brought their styles, creativity and skills in hand screening shirts and designing decks. And no one slacked. Thanks Team!

Then there were friends like [Andy Roberts][4] who played great tunes and [Aaron Phaelan ][5]who came out to shoot some video.

But of course it wouldn&#8217;t have happened without the friends who came to support the cause. Thanks for being there and bringing the kind of enthusiasm that makes us love you. We have a couple more Movember surprises. And, stay tuned, next year&#8217;s planning is already in the works.
