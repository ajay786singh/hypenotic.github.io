Just came across this article for freelancers about the value/return of spending time engaged in Social media.   
The Author glazes over the benefits for larger businesses, but it got my wheels turning. Here are his comments–mine are below:

> &#8220;First, just skip the marketing-centric, revenue-generating B2B/B2C user who recognizes the potential in social media, so they tap into like it was the Klondike.  For these users, social interaction is a business decision, and going social is often associated with a brand or product to result in revenue.  Identifying *why *they’re using social media is easy – it’s *money.&#8221;*

Before you throw out the marketers, it&#8217;s worth pointing out that marketing is changing in certain ways.

Yes, organizations are in business to make money and employees have limited time to spare (I run a design co and none of us have time for the twitterholes we get stuck in). And yes, businesses should consider the relative cost of a sale. But in that the lines of direct communication have been facilitated–in that (good and bad) word spreads faster than ever, and in that some of the most vocal, intelligent, and affluent prospects are engaging in social media (and no longer passively consuming broadcast media)–people with things to sell should be wading into the conversation.

The trick is–like all marketing (and investing for that matter), to be patient, transparent and let go of the reins–you were never really driving anyway. This two way system is not controlled by media giants, there is no safety zone, and you are totally exposed. There is equal opportunity for your organization to shine as long as you genuinely have something useful to offer. Social media channels may not be the Klondike, but since the communication is happening online, more like the Wild west.
