You can love them or hate them but one thing is for sure, memes travel at the speed of light invading our Facebook walls and Twitter timelines until the point of exhaustion. What is it about them that makes people keep posting them and sharing them?

> The definition of Meme according to Webster dictionary is &#8220;an idea, behavior or style that spreads from person to person within a culture.&#8221;

Taking on Jodi&#8217;s <a href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8677/how-say-anything-helped-me-say-something" target="_blank">blog post</a> this week about how movies can help us articulate thoughts, I think Internet memes have a similar function. They are an ultra condensed statement about our opinions with a touch of irony and satire. But their real strength also comes with repetition; we have seen so many of them that they have become a common language in online culture.

Here are my top 4 examples of memes that have recently brought us together (or torn us apart?)

**1. “What society thinks I do” …**  
According to <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/babymantis/how-people-see-me-is-older-than-you-think-1opu" target="_blank">buzzfeed</a> before these meme flooded our Facebook walls with examples of every career imaginable, it appeared on the Wellesley College yearbook in 1909 and it showed how the world viewed women scholars.

My favorite example: Stormtrooper!

**2. Sh*t People Say**

Starting with the video <a href="http://youtu.be/u-yLGIH7W9Y" target="_blank">Shit Girls Say</a> (15 million views on YouTube), posted only two months ago, we&#8217;ve heard what almost everyone has to say!  
My favourite so far: Sh*t nobody says:



**3. Y U No Guy**

He’s the all time #1 most popular character in <a href="http://memegenerator.net/instance/15224346?urlName=Y-U-No&browsingOrder=Popular&browsingTimeSpan=Week" target="_blank">memegenerator.net</a> with 776,097 different combinations of the formula: “(subject noun), [WH]Y [YO]U NO (verb)?”.  
Apparently the original face comes from a Japanese sci-fi manga / anime series called <a title="Know Your Meme" href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/y-u-no-guy" target="_blank">Gantz</a>.

<a href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8711/keep-calm-and-meme-on/attachment/y-u-no" rel="attachment wp-att-8720"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8720" title="y u no" alt="" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/y-u-no.jpg" width="400" height="300" /></a>

**4. Keep Calm and Carry On**

This was originally a poster produced by the British government in 1939 to raise the morale of the British people during Second World War. It was not very well known until the year 2000 when it was reissued and used as a decorative theme for products.  
Check out <a href="http://www.keepcalm-o-matic.co.uk/" target="_blank">Keep Calm O- Matic</a>, a website where you can make your own customizable poster and then share it and have people vote for them. Although for guaranteed results once you&#8217;re done with your meme just post it on <a href="http://pinterest.com/maryelf/keep-calm-and-carry-on/" target="_blank">pinterest</a>.
