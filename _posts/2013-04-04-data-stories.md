My favourite facet of graphic design has always been the art of information graphics. It is the accumulated manifestation of several layers that make it so sophisticated – layers of data fleshed out and graphically analyzed and presented to provide an overview that tells a story. The best part? Just about anything in the world can be taken into process and analyzed, and just about anything can give witness towards understanding the world in which we live. Infographic design brings out the multidisciplinary in you: the scholar, the engineer, the anthropologist, the historian, the writer, the editor.

In architecture school, we had some experience in infographics serving as the presentation of contextual research informing architectural proposal. In laying out accumulated data in a visually-thoughtful array, one is able to draw trends, patterns, and densities that bring to light certain issues and questions. Design is a responsive art, after all: good design is the efficient resolving of a presented issue.

Infographics can range from whimsical posters of [Beatles songs][1] to sobering [anti-gun campaigns][2]; they can swing from [historical timeline-temperature charts of Napoleon&#8217;s 1812 Russian escapade][3] to [cheeky design trend analytics][4]. More than just great wall décor, they document and comment on the things that characterize humanities, generations, and cultures. And indeed, knowledge is power.
