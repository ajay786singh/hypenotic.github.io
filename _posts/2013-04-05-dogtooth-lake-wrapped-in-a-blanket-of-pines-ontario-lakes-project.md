One of the most marked features of Kenora&#8217;s Dogtooth Lake is the presence of towering pine trees, all of equal height, surround the lake. The trees are the result of a huge fire in 1910 that cracked open pine cones and heat resistant seeds were scattered along the shoreline. Â This protective blanket of trees gives the lake a particularly picturesque look, all year long.
