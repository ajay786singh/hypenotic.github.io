I saw Ron Artest start one of the biggest fights in NBA basketball history (Pistons/Pacers). Over his career, he&#8217;s sparked more than his fair share of come-backs and routs. And a few months ago I found out he&#8217;s not waiting around for world leaders to chart a path to world peace. Ron is single-handedly putting the idea in the heads of millions of people around the world, every night the Los Angeles Lakers NBA Franchise plays.

He changed his name to &#8220;Metta WorldPeace&#8221;.

<a href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/8035/social-innovation-lessons-from-an-athlete/attachment/metta-world-peace-lakers-2" rel="attachment wp-att-9288"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-9288" title="metta-world-peace-Lakers" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/metta-world-peace-Lakers1-580x448.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="448" /></a>Known as a frustrating defensive player to some and a hot-headed trouble maker to others, maybe it shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise that Artest is making something important happen without worrying about the consequences of failure/ridicule, or the hassles he causes to his employers.

I&#8217;ve seen the same &#8216;I&#8217;ll figure it out as I go because this project needs to exist&#8217; mentality from luminaries on TED stages and from social innovators managing [school gardens][1].

Our species is fucked if we deem our businesses &#8216;too big too fail&#8217; but &#8216;world peace &#8216;too big to tackle&#8217;.



Apparently, this isn&#8217;t Artest&#8217;s first fresh idea either. He auctioned off his 2010 NBA championship ring for $500,000 to raise awareness for mental illness. Perhaps even more impactful, he publicly thanked his psychiatrist on national television. In a culture that still whispers about mental illness the way Rob Lowe&#8217;s family did about cancer in the hit &#8217;80s movie &#8220;Class&#8221;, Ron&#8217;s mention is like shining a floodlight on the subject.

&#8220;The way it is&#8221; is a starting point, not an indictment. If more people tackled change in whatever capacity they were capable of, well the world would be a better place. Cities, communities and companies would too.
