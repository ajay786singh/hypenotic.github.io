Of course it sucks that this needs to exist. And I know it&#8217;s a joke, but it does. Until people learn to stop writing copy that says &#8220;we&#8221; instead of &#8220;you&#8221;, and until people stop using twitter to have private conversations publicly, we need reminders that the era of talking at people is over.

Jargon doesn&#8217;t make you more credible, it makes you more suspect.
