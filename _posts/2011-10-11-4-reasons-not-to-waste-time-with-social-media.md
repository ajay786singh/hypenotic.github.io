Nothing kills a caffeine-fuelled jam session about all the ways a client could be rocking the social media world more than *this* little question:

> &#8220;How will I ever find the time to do all of this social media stuff when I&#8217;m already overextended trying to make my business a success?&#8221;

That always brings things to an abrupt halt. Buzz. Kill.

Of course it&#8217;s a very fair question&#8211;otherwise so many people wouldn&#8217;t ask it. The good news is we have some perfectly good answers that will help keep your social media mojo alive after the caffeine wears off:

1.  **You&#8217;re either marketing or you&#8217;re not**: Hopefully we&#8217;re not in the [&#8220;if you build it they will come&#8221;][1] phase of your business and *get* that you need to do *some* kind of marketing or communications to help spread your idea or brand. We all agree that you can do this in many ways&#8211;flyers, networking, magnets, writing a book, running print ads&#8211;or all of the above. No matter what you opt to do you&#8217;ll need to spend time and/or money to spread the word. Just because the social media platforms you&#8217;ll use are free don&#8217;t be fooled into thinking you won&#8217;t need to invest in making that real estate meaningful.
2.  **Be Strategic: **Jumping in head first and using social media tools as a way to push out messages is guaranteed waste of time, and time is something that&#8217;s in short supply. MBA&#8217;s learn that efficiency comes when you &#8220;plan the work and work the plan.&#8221; Same rules apply to social media. You need to figure out what you can be sharing that others could care about, find your communities of interest and learn how to be a useful and relevant member of the community. Building relationships takes time, learning new skills takes time. There&#8217;s no way around it.
3.  **Realize you&#8217;re on a fascinating voyage (Just slide, slide, slippity slide): **I&#8217;m guessing you read online, you meet cool people, you see awesome stuff. The stuff that you do everyday is the stuff of social media.* That&#8217;s* what you can be sharing. I&#8217;m not going to pretend it doesn&#8217;t take time to edit a video, post a photo or write a blog (if you&#8217;re stuck on this point please go back to step #1). But you don&#8217;t have to make up content. The content will practically write itself once you know the filter you&#8217;re going to apply when you look out at the world.
4.  **It&#8217;s Scalable. **It&#8217;s easy to think you have to do everything all at once and to become overwhelmed by all of the possibilities that social media represents. But social media is an entirely different beast than traditional media where the process of going from creative brief to fully executed campaign is tantamount to blowing your wad. Social media is more a slow drip where you determine the flow. What you decide to share is ever evolving as your business and your interests evolve. How much you share can fluctuate as your business fluctuates. Communities understand that. But first you need to build community.
