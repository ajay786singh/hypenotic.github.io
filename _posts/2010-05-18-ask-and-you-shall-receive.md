Kid: &#8220;fine&#8221; <long silence>

Mom to kid &#8220;What song did you sing at school today?&#8221;

Kid: &#8220;Oh we sang lalalala. It was so funny because&#8230;.blah blah blah&#8221;

Here&#8217;s that same information translated into social media.

Ask people to contribute by having a big empty comments box under your clever blog post.

Reaction: Empty comments box

Ask people to share [mom&#8217;s worst cooking story][1] (oh and offer them a little incentive in the form of a contest) ask them to share their favorite [truly Canadian foods ][2]

Reaction: Submissions (check out [this one by our very own Barry Martin][3]), tweets, photos, videos and the like. Funny, well written and engaging content that makes for great posts.

The Rub: Don&#8217;t ask people to react to social media in general terms. Ask them for something specific that will tweak their interest, get them to giggle,  reflect or identify in some way.

It&#8217;s just like all social interactions, a legitimate connection opens up the lines of communication.

A better question will get you more responses of much higher caliber. You don&#8217;t have to offer incentives or turn it into a contest to be successful. But, it does help lower the barrier to entry so people can start crossing over from observers to participants.

So, what&#8217;s the blog post, tweet, question that&#8217;s gotten you the most comments or responses.

Don&#8217;t leave me hangin&#8217;
