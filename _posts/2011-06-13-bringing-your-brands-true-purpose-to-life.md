My friend, talented filmmaker [Ezra Soiferman ][1]noted my mention of [Dr. Bronner&#8217;s][2] soap in my [last blog post][3] and knew I needed to know about [Dr. Bronner&#8217;s Interblastive Foam Shower.][4]

Now the interblastive foam shower is feeding my  long-standing fascination with Dr. Bronner&#8217;s marketing tactics. Whenever I see a bottle of liquid soap in my tub covered with brilliant body copy like this:

> Replace half-true Socialist-fluoride poison & tax-slavery with full-truth, work-speech-press & profitsharing Socialaction! All-One! So, help build 4 billion Hannibal wind-power plants, charging 96 billion battery-banks, powering every car-factory-farm-home-monorail & pump, watering Babylon-roof-gardens & 800 billion Israel-Milorganite fruit trees, guarded by Swiss 6000 year Universal Military Training.

I think of all the advertising execs sweating bullets over a tag line for deodorant&#8211;convinced they have to get it just right to get it to move it off the shelves. Dr. Bronner&#8217;s on-package proselytizing breaks pretty much every marketing rule. And it sells like crazy.

Dr. Bronner&#8217;s Interblastive Foam Shower is the most truly awesome leadership activity I&#8217;ve ever come across.



[All one Ark promo][5] from [Tim Clark][6] on [Vimeo][7].

At Hypenotic, leadership means  making things happen in the world that capture what you care about in a way that other people can care about it too.  For some, it&#8217;s an event, for some it lives online, it can be a great philanthropic partnership. For Dr. Bronner&#8217;s, leadership comes in the shape of  a ginormous bathtub that sprays foam.

Dr. Bronner&#8217;s Intergalactic Foam Shower  parks at music festivals across the US and that&#8217;s when the fun begins. As their website makes clear:

> Most showers at festivals (if they exist at all) are solitary short experiences, taken only for practical purposes in a sterile uncool environment. The All-One Ark is different: showers are taken with friends, old and new, in a celebratory way to get clean.

It&#8217;s helpful, it&#8217;s  environmental (one 1-3 gallons of water per person), it&#8217;s celebratory, it&#8217;s community-building, it&#8217;s educational, it&#8217;s art, it&#8217;s marketing.  It&#8217;s fucking amazing.

If there was one thing you could do that would show everyone what you stand for what would it be? What would it do? Who would it serve? What would it change?

We&#8217;re asking ourselves these questions of ourselves all the time &#8217;cause at the end of the day, you can&#8217;t just say you believe in it, you&#8217;ve got to stick your neck out and make something great happen. We&#8217;ll be telling you more about what we&#8217;re up to. Tell us what you&#8217;ve got up your sleeve.

P.S. I wrote  Dr. Bronner&#8217;s to see if they&#8217;ll bring the intergalactic foam shower to [Hillside.][8] I&#8217;ll keep you posted.
