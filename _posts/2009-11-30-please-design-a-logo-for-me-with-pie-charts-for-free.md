My pal Craig Swistun just sent over this exchange regarding spec work.

This is the beginning of a hysterical but also sad exchange. I&#8217;ve come across my share of enthusiastic folks with bad ideas and no clue why you don&#8217;t want to work on them instead of your paying client work informed by good ideas.

> Disregarding the fact that you have still not paid me for work I completed earlier this year despite several assertions that you would do so, I would be delighted to spend my free time creating logos and pie charts for you based on further vague promises of future possible payment. Please find attached pie chart as requested and let me know of any changes required.

Do read the entire back and forth. It&#8217;s worthwhile.

It particularly resonated with me because the site reminded me of a book called &#8220;[Letters from a nut][2]&#8221; I read while in the hospital recovering from an appendectomy. This was a problem, because the book defined &#8216;side-splitting&#8217; humour for me. I believe it was written by Jerry Seinfeld under a pseudonym.

That was slightly different than the letters here because the foil in those letters is inane corporate policy and the drones who peddle it. Here, we&#8217;re largely talking about business owners with a simple lack of consideration.

Classic.
