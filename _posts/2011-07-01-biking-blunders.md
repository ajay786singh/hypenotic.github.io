As an angst-y teen, I often went for bike rides that lasted hours. With no clear destination in mind, I was on the all important quest in search of  &#8220;myself.&#8221;  While now I laugh at how insignificant my problems really were, I can&#8217;t help but think about how biking was a healing force in my life.

When I [read about plans to remove the Jarvis bike lane][1], I felt a significant loss for those who bike in Toronto; my mind immediately turned to the psychic benefits that would be lost along with the bike lane. Let&#8217;s face it: Biking = therapy.

And it&#8217;s not just my experience. According to Rory McMullan, author of [Biking to Work][2], regular cyclists:

*   add over 2 years to their life expectancy
*   have the general fitness and health of someone 10 years younger
*   are 50% less likely to experience depression

As experts now know, depression isn&#8217;t an isolated issue. People who experience depression are more likely to [other chronic health issues][3] like diabetes, arthritis, heart disease, stroke&#8230;the list goes on and on.

Even if we just focused on the mental health benefits of biking, we could pretty easily make the case that bike lanes would result in reduced health costs, greater productivity resulting in a healthy economy and more taxable income.

All I know for certain is that during my long aimless bike rides when I talked out my problems (albeit, to myself- no shame here!) and cleared my head, I saved myself from juicy therapist bills and from visits to my doctor which could be directed toward more pressing health issues.

So can someone, for the love of god, buy Ford a bike?!
