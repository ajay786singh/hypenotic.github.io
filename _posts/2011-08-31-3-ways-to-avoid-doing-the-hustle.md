A firm believer in slow principles and a generally annoying optimist he rolled his eyes.  Together we started contemplating the connection between the two meanings of hustle.

*Hustle:*

*   To seriously move your ass to be as productive as possible
*   To act in an exploitive manner to get what you want–at all costs. To steal from others to benefit yourself.

The second, less ethical definition was actually the first to exist.

As early as 1680 the Dutch used the word &#8220;*hutselen&#8221;  *to mean &#8220;to shake to and fro&#8221; derived from a game translated into hustle cap where coins were aggressively shaken in a cap.

Something about the pushing and jostling sense of the word became associated with shoving anyone and anything out of the way to get ahead by any means possible. A Machiavellian approach to getting ahead where the &#8220;ends justify the means.&#8221; Centuries later this version of the term has been glorified in hip hop culture with the hustler as a kind of urban hero. [Think 50 Cent.][1]

Hustle&#8217;s association with productivity didn&#8217;t emerge until the late 1800&#8242;s when Abraham Lincoln was credited with saying:

> Things may come to those who wait. But only the things left by those who hustle.

And Thomas Edison is credited with saying:

> Everything comes to him who hustles while he waits

Turns out that waiting and hustling are mortal enemies.

But consider this; hustling in Lincoln and Edison&#8217;s sense of the word is a kind of an exploitive thief as well. [Research shows][2] that 12% of Canadians will experience anxiety. It&#8217;s no wonder really. Consider how hard we push ourselves to use up every moment of our time to be bigger, better, more. At the end of a long day we end up literally feeling like we&#8217;ve been &#8220;shaken to and fro.&#8221; Those two definitions aren&#8217;t so far apart after all.

Carrie Fisher makes reference to this reality when she said:

> Instant gratification takes too long

So post-vacation and during the back to school season I want to share some great resources to help focus your attention on how to be productive without letting the hustle steal your life. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;m working on right alongside you:

*   [Zen Habits][3]: Leo Baubata is a web luminary on the subject of living simpler while being more productive. He&#8217;s done it himself to great success. His blog post [How Not to Hurry][4] based on the Taoist premise &#8220;if nature can get everything done without rushing, so can you.&#8221; Baubata admits its not easy, but the key is taking responsibility for your life.  Again, it&#8217;s not about achieving less. It&#8217;s about achieving what you want with less pain and strife.
*   [Professional Hobo:][5] If you wish to live vicariously through someone who made the choice to step off the grid, this is the blogger for you. Nora Dunn was a financial planning expert in Toronto until 2007 when she sold off everything she had and hit the road. Why? As she says &#8221; &#8216;Life Happens When You&#8217;re Busy Making Plans.&#8217; I realized this was happening to me and I didn&#8217;t like it so much&#8221;
*   Watch [Carl Honoré&#8217;s TED Talk on Slowness][6] focused on our need for speed (living the fast life instead of the good life) and what&#8217;s to be gained by slowing down in terms of health, work, relationships, etc. He&#8217;s committed to The Slow Movement and stop living on a stop watch.
