Diamond Lake in Bancroft Ontario is a mecca for ice climbers. There are steep cliff&#8217;s behind Bancroft&#8217;s main street where run off freezes over, creating the perfect conditions for adventure seekers. The spot called Eagle&#8217;s Nest is so popular that[ The Alpine Club of Canada&#8217;s Toronto Chapter][1] takes members on several weekend-long expeditions which are well suited to beginner and expert levels.

If you&#8217;re keen to check it out, visit [Mountain Equipment Coop][2] to rent your equipment. If you&#8217;re at all curious, watch two climbers do their stuff just 2 hours away from Toronto.
