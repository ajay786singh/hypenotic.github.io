[Camp Oochigeas, ][1]also known as &#8220;Camp Ooch&#8221; began as an eight week summer camp for kids with cancer in Muskoka. That camp, is now one part of what Camp Ooch provides to kids. But the core values of camp continue to guide Camp Ooch through the next phases of their evolution.  
<a rel="attachment wp-att-5076" href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/5070/making-camp-a-mission-camp-oochigeas/attachment/campooch_pillars"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5076" title="CampOoch_Pillars" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/CampOoch_Pillars.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="288" /></a>On May 26th, Ooch Downtown will open it&#8217;s doors. Located at College and Bathurst, the new downtown hub for kids with cancer is outfitted with big open rooms to accommodate anything from floor hockey to crafts, a media room, a full kitchen for cooking classes and the pièce de résistance, a two story climbing wall.

When I first encountered an outdoor ad announcing Ooch&#8217;s arrival in the city (created by Ooch&#8217;s agency [MacLaren McCann][2])  the idea of a downtown space seemed like an exciting move for the organization. I sat down with Executive Director Alex Robertson and Director of Development Michelle Afinec to discuss Ooch Downtown and what it means for Camp Ooch.

When Camp Ooch was &#8220;just a camp&#8221; on a rented property 8 weeks a summer, they could be defined by the single &#8220;tactic&#8221;; summer Camp for kids with cancer.  In 2004 Camp Ooch raised funds and purchased land in Muskoka and built a camp of  their own.  Suddenly they could operate year round. This was a re-defining moment for Camp Ooch. Were they still a camp, or were they becoming something else?

Turns out another important shift helped redefine Camp Ooch&#8217;s focus&#8211;kids with cancer were surviving their disease, but not without enduring long, hard treatments. While this obviously signaled a tremendous victory, the treatments take an enormous toll on kids who often leave school, friends and normal routines behind.

Camp Ooch determined that they could serve more kids and still remain a &#8220;camp&#8221; by redefining the very meaning of the word *camp*.

> Camp Ooch, redefined camp, not as a place, but as a philosophy and a social cure for kids with cancer.

Camp Ooch refocused their mission and established  4 pillars inherent in all camp experiences; friendship, fun, challenge and magic.

This mission guided Camp Ooch in making decisions about how to grow and meet the demand of doctors, families and the Ooch volunteer base.

With their mission as a platform, they began providing &#8220;camp&#8221; experiences at [Sick Kids Hospital][3]. Today 350 volunteers work to ensure that there is on-site programming at Sick Kids every day of the week.

And now with the new downtown site, kids from Sick Kids can travel to Ooch Downtown and experience friends, fun, challenge&#8211;and of course, magic like every kid deserves to experience. Yes it&#8217;s because of an engaged community and generous donors, but it&#8217;s also because they, as an organization invested in moving beyond a tactic and getting on a mission that matters.

Camp Ooch&#8217;s Executive Director and Director of Development gave me a tour around the new place (there were people still painting) Take a look at these impressive digs.
