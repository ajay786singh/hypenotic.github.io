This is a very sweet, 1920&#8242;s black and white style video called Catchacoma Flapper about taking a dip in Catchacoma Lake in the Kawartha Highlands. It&#8217;s &#8220;Super-8&#8243; look can&#8217;t help but make you feel happy and reminisce about a simpler, sweeter time when men and women donned their &#8220;swimming costumes&#8221; and joyfully took to the waters.

This video gives rise to the question, did flappers actually swim? Well, here are some important facts that confirm that yes, indeed Gertrude,  those rebellious ladies of the 1920s knew how to do the backstroke:

*   American [Gertrude Ederle][1] became the first woman to swim across the English Channel in 1926
*   At the 1920 summer Olympics [Ethelda Bleibtrey][2] won three gold metals
*   Also in 1920, Australian swimmer [Annette Kellerman][3] won the ladies&#8217; 100 yards and mile championships of New South Wales in the record time
