Accessible predominantly by train or plane, Esnagi is tucked away from the world and a haven for fish, moose, and other gems of nature&#8211; but mostly fish. Esnagi boasts plentiful and trophy-sized walleye and pike for the enjoyment of recreational anglers. Testimonials of great fishing trips and annual treks to this favourite spot seem to be as plentiful as the fish in the lake about which they are written. Lodges at Esnagi Lake adhere to the principles that guide fish-lovers in the conservation of fish as well as the fun of fishing, creating a sustainable and Â enjoyable environment. That&#8217;s some great nature-lovin&#8217;!
