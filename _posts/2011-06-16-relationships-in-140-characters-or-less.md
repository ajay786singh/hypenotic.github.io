<p style="text-align: left;">
  That was, until I stumbled upon the ever-engaging <em><a href="http://tonightnewspaper.com/index.html">t.o.night Magazine</a></em>; Toronto’s only free evening daily magazine targeted to the commuter crowd.
</p>

Though a short read, t.o.night accomplishes to provide me with a daily fix of the latest news in entertainment, world issues and information about Toronto events, new restaurants, etc. Scanning through the first pages eats up about 10 precious minutes of my time, cramped uncomfortably between bodies on the Go Train. But as I reach the last few pages, a crescendo of interest in me slowly builds to reveal the infamous Shout-Out’s; t.o.night’s most popular section.

On the Shout-Out’s page, readers can write published messages to fellow commuters, rant about whatever’s on their mind, pose questions to fellow commuters, and make various requests at no charge by emailing them to the paper.

While most of the time it is entertaining- to say the least- reading “BadBoi4Lyfe’s” charming ads encouraging fellow “commuter hotties” to find him to make his trip home “fun timez 4 both”, I can’t help but notice how the shout-outs reveal what is quintessentially wrong with humanity.

In a world where social media is growing with every new day, people’s charisma and ability to have face-to-face social interaction is dwindling.  Somehow, reading desperate men and women’s postings about their desire for communication with others is quite ironic and- frankly- funny to me when, right in front of them, is an array of hundreds of different people crammed in one space, all trying to pass time.

These hilarious Shout Outs fill one or two pages a day, with Jodi Isenberg, t.o.night’s editor in the [National Post][1] saying,

> “There’s a community riding the GO Train and they want to interact”.

Did I get that right? These people want a way to *interact*? Try opening your mouth to speak; I guarantee that it takes less effort and time. Don’t get me wrong, many Shout-Outs are helpful, inspiring, light-hearted and/or innocent, but a good chunk of them leave me shaking my head, deflated.

While social media is a very helpful tool for businesses and for the vast majority of people who are genuinely not creepy, I think it’s important to make sure that we do not decrease face-to-face interaction.

No one can run a successful business relationship in 140 characters. A successful relationship cannot rely on the often grammatically incorrect public posts you make, but instead runs on social interaction; phone calls, meetings over coffee, chats over a cold beer etc.

We should make more phone calls when we could text, pose more upfront questions rather than wait to shoot an email and be careful not to rely on social media as a tie to others, but regard it as a means to keep up to date with those whom we care about and/or are interested in.  And when you have cured yourself of being a creepy facebook-lurking, twittering hobbit, social media can supplement an already successful friendship, business, etc.

All I am suggesting is that we use social media very intelligently and carefully, and it will work in our favour. Don&#8217;t hang your dirty laundry out for everybody to see, because, really, you will regret it. Be yourself and don&#8217;t be creepy (yes, I&#8217;m talking to you BadBoi4Lyfe) and use our amazing technological benefits to your advantage.

Because while Social Media is your friend, a *real* relationship cannot survive and flourish in 140 characters or less.
