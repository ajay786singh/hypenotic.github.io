We&#8217;ve had a bit too much fun lately creating video content for [Fiesta Farms. ][1]First we helped the staff of Fiesta fete the new Mayor of Fiesta Farms on [Foursquare][2], and then we made a Double Rainbow spoof video to promote [Grow for the Stop ][3]veggies&#8217; arrival.

The strategy for Fiesta Farms is based on the idea that Food Matters for different people for a number of different reasons&#8211;but that for Fiesta Farms&#8217; shoppers it&#8217;s always about more than filling their fridge and their bellies. But that doesn&#8217;t mean we have to be earnest all the time. In fact, we&#8217;ll leave that job to [Whole Foods][4].

Fiesta Farms is Toronto&#8217;s largest independent grocery store. That gives them the freedom to buy from farms and entrepreneurs other, bigger guys, can&#8217;t. But it also gives them them the ability to be a little off beat. If you&#8217;ve been to the store, you know that it has a little quirk deep in its bones. It&#8217;s an unpolished space. Its employees feel like real people. Its owner, Joe Virgona, is an iracible guy who has a heart of gold.  And that&#8217;s what makes Fiesta Farms so easy to love.

We have a lot of fun playing up Fiesta&#8217;s charmingly quirky side. Too much fun perhaps. But eating your veggies doesn&#8217;t have to be boring.

Also, special thanks to the super-duper talented Aaron at [Tarazat Studios ][5]who leant us a hand with editing the Mayor video.
