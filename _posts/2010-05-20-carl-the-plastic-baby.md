Have you seen Carl the Plastic Baby? I first spotted the intriguing billboard featuring a plastic baby on Queen West at Gladstone. Unlike other obvious teaser campaigns, this one left me asking who was behind the billboard and what it meant. So, I visited [carltheplasticbaby.com][1], the url posted in tiny print on the billboard. The site asks the question &#8220;Are you interested in having a child but you don&#8217;t want all the hassles?&#8221; and offers a means to purchase a plastic baby of any ethnicity delivered directly to your door.

What&#8217;s it all about? [Unurth][2],  a site that showcases street art around the world highlights Carl, and it&#8217;s creater street artist fauxreel who is  best known for his [Squareheads Vespa ][3]series. In that series, Fauxreel is exploring

> The grey area between street art, graffiti and advertising and attempting to make connections between products and people’s identities.

Carl the Plastic Baby walks this line as well. According to Fauxreel, the Carl billboards are based on the commoditization of children whose parents eagerly buy up any and all unnecessary products to (in Fauxreel&#8217;s words) &#8220;keep up with the Jones&#8221;&#8221; And, the demographic fact that people are having their kids later in life. Carl is the ideal solution to this dilemma since:

> buying a plastic baby might help those who don&#8217;t have one of their own yet to feel like they belong&#8230;Which is what advertising is all about&#8230;

At a time when a stroller like an uber modern [Stoke ][4]can run you more than a flight to Paris, we need to question the commoditization of baby-hood. Have you roamed through a [Toys R Us][5] store recently? A balanced parent can barely find anything to buy in a store full of plastic doo-dads.

The response to that has been the creation of all kinds of &#8220;eco-friendly&#8221; stuff made for kids. Know what&#8217;s even more environmentally friendly? Not buying stuff at all&#8211;a case that is so beautifully made in the Creative Commons video [The Story Stuff][6].

What if along with the stuff, we bought the baby too? As is highlighted on the Carl site, it would be oh so convenient: &#8220;No crying. No pooing. No babysitter.&#8221;

Since making babies is an afterthought&#8211;after schooling ourselves to death, after launching our successful careers, buying a house, etc. we could skip all the hassles of being aging parents with Carl. Check out the links on the site if you need to make the case not to have kids. They include [The Baby Cost Calculator][7], [Top 100 Reasons Not to Have Kids][8], and a link to a [Baby Snot Sucker. ][9]

By placing this message among the advertising messages that bombard us every day Fauxreel has succeeded in giving us pause to consider the shit that is sold to us every day, and the stories that compel us to buy shit we simply don&#8217;t need. So, thanks Carl, I&#8217;ll take 2&#8211;one white and one brown-ish.
