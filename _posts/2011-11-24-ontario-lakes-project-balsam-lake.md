Balsam Lake is Canada&#8217;s Fresh Water Summit&#8211;meaning it is the highest fresh water point in Canada from which you can circumnavigate the globe.

Thats right, from Balsam&#8217;s humble shores a skipper with a seaworthy vessel could head east to the Atlantic Ocean, west to the Pacific, north to the Arctic Ocean or south to the Caribbean — without ever touching land.

It&#8217;s not clear whether anyone has actually sailed from Balsam to any ocean (never mind circumventing the globe), but the fact that you *could* if you wanted to is still pretty cool.
