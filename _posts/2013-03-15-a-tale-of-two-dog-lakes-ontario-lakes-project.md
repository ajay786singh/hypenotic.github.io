Home of a provincial park as well as a hydro dam supplying drinking water to the nearby town of Thunder Bay,Â Big Dog Lake and Little Dog Lake were once also the home of an Ojibway tribe. The names of the two lakes are derived from the image of a dog dug into a ridge between them. Legend has it that this noble dog alerted the sleeping village of an impending attack by the Cree, thus saving their lives.

EDIT: Dog Lake serves as a back-up drinking water supply for Thunder Bay; the town&#8217;s primary source is Lake Superior.
