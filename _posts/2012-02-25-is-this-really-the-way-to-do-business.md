Last night I&#8217;m at <a class="zem_slink" title="Staples Inc." href="http://www.staples.com/" rel="homepage" target="_blank">Staples</a> to pick up some paper for my <a class="zem_slink" title="Laser printer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_printer" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">laser printer</a>.

I&#8217;m overwhelmed by the choices.

There is laser printer paper, inkjet paper, recycled paper, hi gloss paper, heavy weight paper, light utility paper, colored paper. And more.

I settle on some recycled paper with the <a class="zem_slink" title="Forest Stewardship Council" href="http://www.fsc.org/" rel="homepage" target="_blank">FSC</a> logo because, when I can, I want to do the right thing. I figure when the barriers are low there&#8217;s no excuse.

However, when I get to the checkout the cashier asks me whether I wanted to take advantage of a 27% discount on still other paper I had failed to notice in the paper aisle.

She says the paper is essentially the same. At first glance, it appears to be identical.

Same quantity, same weight, same brightness, same graphic design, same bullet points and starbursts on the packaging.

Well, of course I want a deal, but I can&#8217;t help wondering what the difference is.

The cashier tells me this otherwise identical paper isn&#8217;t recyclable.

For an extra buck-seventy-five, I figure I should do the right thing.

I can&#8217;t help but be reminded what a crazy world we live in where we actually incentivize cutting corners and making poor choices.

And I wonder&#8230;

Are there places where I don&#8217;t do the right thing or the best thing for my clients because it costs too much (in time, money or effort)?

If so, is this really the way to do business?

What do you think?
