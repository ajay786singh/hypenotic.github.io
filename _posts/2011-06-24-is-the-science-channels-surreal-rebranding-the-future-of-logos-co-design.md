My (web) friend Michael Surtees ([@gesturetheory][1]) shared a neat bit from Fast Company&#8217;s | Co.Design  on Twitter today that really resonated with me.

He was asking whether the Science Channel&#8217;s new identity materials by superstar motion graphics folks [Imaginary Forces][2] were the next step for logos. See the piece then read my thoughts on the matter below.

[Imaginary Forces &#8211; Science Channel Rebrand][3] from [Imaginary Forces][4] on [Vimeo][5].

We&#8217;ve been advising clients that their logo develops meaning largely based on experiences people have over multiple interactions with their brand. Yes, the first impression counts for more, but a less than stellar initial showing tends to render you less visible, not less likeable.

Sophisticated aesthetic brand guidelines articulating parameters for every situation in which your logo might be glimpsed are the trappings of a bygone era. Heresy? I bet Massimo Vignelli would say &#8216;roll with the times&#8217;. I also bet that even Coke doesn&#8217;t send out a rep to make sure every truck has the ribbon painted just right anymore. It&#8217;s unsustainable.

*   The intended viewers of your artfully crafted logo see thousands of other logos and messages all equally vying for  their attention daily
*   We&#8217;re increasingly living in a motion-driven world, and unlike you, your audience spends more time looking at other images than your logo
*   It&#8217;s easier than ever for people to take and use your art for their own purposes, so why not build flexibility in?

And hot damn, isn&#8217;t it a lot sexier than your flat static piece?

Kudos to a flat-out cool execution and identity materials that reward you for looking at them. Remarkable–I think that&#8217;s what logos are supposed to be.
