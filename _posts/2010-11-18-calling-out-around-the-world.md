We&#8217;ve been planning and calling and working, and calling. All in support of [Movember][1] andÂ [Prostate Cancer Canada.][2]

We don&#8217;t generally go for the celebrity endorsement thing. It&#8217;s against our genetic makeup. But somehow, the idea of getting Burton Cummings, Lanny MacDonald or Alex Trebek in the room (sadly Louis Riel, Doug Henning and Bruno Gerussi are no longer with us) was irresistible.

So, I&#8217;ve been seeing what I can do to send our Great Canadian Moustache Party over the top. It all takes place Movember 24th at Mildred&#8217;s Temple Kitchen. [Get your tickets here ][3]because capacity is limited. You never know who may show up!
