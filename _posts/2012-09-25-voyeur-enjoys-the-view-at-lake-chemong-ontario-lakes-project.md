    Lake Chemong near Peterborough is very a popular destination for cottagers, partly because of the spectacular views. For example, check out  a photograph of the view from one cottage on Lake Chemong listed on <a href="http://www.cottagesincanada.com/canadianlakefrontcottage">CottagesinCanada.com</a>

    However, I should warn you that if you&#8217;re looking to rent a cottage in on the lake, be sure to be on the lookout for a voyeur who may indeed be watching you and not the sunset.

    This summer a Toronto man who owns a cottage on Lake Chemong <a href="http://www.cp24.com/toronto-man-charged-with-voyeurism-for-allegedly-recording-cottage-renters-1.854808">was charged with voyeurism</a> when a renter contacted OPP after discovering security cameras inside and outside the cottage, including in the master bedroom.

    The moral of the story. Enjoy the view at Lake Chemong. Just be sure you&#8217;re not it.
