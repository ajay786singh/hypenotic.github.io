When it comes time to choose a colour palette for a project, sometimes it&#8217;s hard to get started. But as I discovered last weekend, you can find colour inspiration all around you.

On a sunny Sunday morning I became obsessed with the [Cliqcliq Colors app][1], which I downloaded ages ago and then forgot about. The app allows you to create colour palettes from scratch, from new photos, from photos in your library, or photos on flickr. I started taking pictures and testing it out, and I had so much fun seeing how each photo could be captured in palette form within seconds.

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7592" title="Cliqcliq_maple" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Cliqcliq_maple.png" alt="Cliqcliq maple" width="100%" />

This app isn’t perfect by any  means. Sometimes the colours it draws from a photo don’t really seem to work together, and that’s when it might help to zoom in on specific areas. You can also edit each colour within the palette. Sometimes the chosen photo doesn&#8217;t make a good colour scheme at all. But it’s so quick and easy you can always choose another photo and try again.

There are of course many sources for colour palettes online, such as [Kuler][2] or [Colourlovers][3], where you can create your own or browse through millions created by others. What I like about Cliqcliq, however, is that you can instantly create colour combinations from things in your surrounding environment, at the very moment you are inspired by them. Now every time I go for a walk I see the potential for colour palettes all over the place.

Other well-known colour palette apps are [Color Expert][4], and [Palettes][5].

Have fun.
