<a rel="attachment wp-att-2674" href="http://hypenotic.com/branding/2672/shut-up-and-let-me-go/attachment/screen-shot-2010-08-10-at-12-08-46-pm"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2674" title="Screen shot 2010-08-10 at 12.08.46 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-10-at-12.08.46-PM.png" alt="" width="314" height="293" /></a>Had a fun run-in with a day camp staffer who informed me that I would not be able to receive a refund for a camp position my daughter would no longer need.

I wasn&#8217;t charged an administrative fee to cover the costs of filling the position again (there&#8217;s a waiting list). This was a punitive slap on the arse no money back guarantee. Let me repeat. No. Money. Back.

And this from a camp that sent my daughter home with the lyrics to the song &#8216;[Simple Gifts&#8217;][1] hand scrawled on a scrap of paper because a dear, sweet counsellor overheard her singing it and encouraged her to share it with the group (sniff).

The camp is behaving like cell phone companies who have contracts that protect *their *interests with little thought for what would serve their customers best.

On the other hand, some notable companies have incredibly simple exit plans that make it virtually seamless for you to go elsewhere. One shining example is the online billing service [Freshbooks. ][2]Freshbooks lives up to its tagline &#8220;Painless Billing&#8221; by allowing you to leave, or downgrade your account with no questions asked. No one will ask you why you&#8217;re leaving or negotiate to get you to stay. You simply click a a button and off you go.

Another notable example is the small  business software company[ 37 Signals. ][3]Their philosophy is based on letting their customers outgrow them. In their book [Rework][4], the company&#8217;s founders Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson say that they realize they can&#8217;t be all things to all people, and that when some companies &#8220;grow up&#8221; they&#8217;ll move on to other software companies. In short &#8220;Scaring away new customers is worse than losing old customers.&#8221;

When you&#8217;re willing to let customers exit without pain and suffering you&#8217;re saying several important things about your brand:

*   You are thinking about your customers&#8217; needs over your own
*   You know who you are and who you aren&#8217;t&#8211;and that what you&#8217;re offering isn&#8217;t for everyone
*   You aren&#8217;t just being punitive. Sure there may be costs when someone goes. And it&#8217;s fair to pass those on. But, don&#8217;t just do it because you&#8217;re angry and want to punish somebody
*   You&#8217;re confident in your own abilities. You don&#8217;t need to force me to love you, I&#8217;m going to love you just because you&#8217;re so great at doing what you do
*   You want me to pass you on. I may not want to use you anymore, but that doesn&#8217;t mean we can&#8217;t still be friends and I can&#8217;t say really nice things about you to other people

So let&#8217;s not make this whole breakup thing so painful. There are lots of reasons why people have to move on. Some of them very innocuous. So let&#8217;s part on happy terms, shall we?

Oh, and can I have my jeans back?
