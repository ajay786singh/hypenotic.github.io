In [my recent post][1] about fixing your email headline to get me to actually read it, I promised to show you how to test your headlines against your current ones that may be getting stale. And I&#8217;ll do that shortly.  
But first, that post garnered some interesting responses.

Two people thought the example headline I gave sounded spammy and they&#8217;d unsubscribe if they got an email with that headline.

At least one commenter actually DID unsubscribe.

Is the notion of personalizing your headlines ill considered?

Curious to know, I did some cursory research to see whether anyone had stats on this. Results were quite divergent.

[One provider][2] said that personalization [improved open rates][3] on a sample of 202 million emails. [Another][4] said both [open and click rates suffered][5].

Seems the practice is hotly contested.

Coming from some marketers (especially, um, spammers) personalizing a headline likely would seem spammy.

But I suspect that whether or not it does hinges on the relationship you have with your list.

For the record, I wasn&#8217;t suggesting that every email you send out should be personalized. But rather that if you don&#8217;t want your email to blend into the background noise in my inbox, for heaven&#8217;s sake grab me with your headlines.

One MailChimp post suggests that the best subject line is one that mirrors [your audience&#8217;s expectations][6]. That different subject lines apply to newsletters than special offers.

So how do you know what kinds of headlines will resonate with your list? Start split testing.

If you&#8217;re not familiar with the term, split- or A/B- testing refers to sending different versions of your email to different segments of your list and measuring the results.

Generally to start you&#8217;ll want to keep the variables to a minimum. For example, send the same email to two segments each with a different headline and see which one gets the best response.

Since many of our clients use MailChimp (as we do), here&#8217;s a link to an [overview of the split testing features][7] on Mailchimp . Be sure to watch the video as well.
