On a signpost entering Eagle lake there reads the moniker &#8220;Rhubarb Capital of Ontario.&#8221; An issue of [Cottage Life][1] leaves the two visitors to Haliburton pondering, just what is so rhubarb-y about Eagle Lake. They search out the answer only to come up empty handed.

> **Me:** Did they eat rhubarb?  
> **Shauna:** I’m not sure.
> 
> Later, Shauna and I went into the Eagle Lake store. I found an employee in the produce section.
> 
> **Me:** Do you have any rhubarb?  
> **Store employee:** I’m not sure.

My search also came up mostly fruitless. Someone named Margie responded to a blog post chronicling a [Michigan woman&#8217;s personal history of rhubarb][2] by stating:

Others have referred to Eagle Lake as the [Rhubarb Capital of Canada. ][3]

It&#8217;s like a fish story without any fish.

However, rather than quash the mythical connection between Eagle Lake and rhubarb, we want to stoke those flames in hopes that someone, someday will indeed help Eagle Lake live up to it&#8217;s mighty reputation.

All hail Eagle Lake, The World&#8217;s Rhubarb Capital!
