Of course half the point of our Discovery session is to get up to speed on what&#8217;s special about our clients in a hurry. But yesterday I ranÂ a strategy development session for our friends at [Taste of Nova Scotia][1] that offered learning in areas I hadn&#8217;t expected.

Taste of Nova Scotia is currently a 135 member marketing network of restaurants, food producers and processors across the province. They&#8217;re great, hard-working people doing things that matter, and Hypenotic is here to help them define a needle for this powerful network to focus on.

I expected to find great ingredients:

*   A GORGEOUS province
*   Famously nice people
*   World class seafood
*   Dedicated team and board members

I found two ingredients that blew me away:

1.  **Nova Scotia is more in touch with their heritage, traditions and culture than most places. **Their size and location have shielded them somewhat from hyper-commercialization. Unlike other provinces and states with major cities in them, Nova Scotia has reacted to a sudden influx of corporate wealth eschewing useful urban planning in favour of random corporate interests. Over growlers of [Granite Brewery ][2]&#8216;[Peculiar][3]&#8216; and then &#8216;[Greenman Organic][4]&#8216; around a fire at the[ Atlantica Oak Island Resort][5] last night, William Allaway of [Acadian Maple Products ][6]told me that I&#8217;d be hard pressed to find a Nova Scotian who couldn&#8217;t find a cord of wood and survive on it.
2.  **Nova Scotia has an amazing team looking out for it&#8217;s interests**. During the brainstorm session I was schooled in the origins and ongoing make-up of Taste of Nova Scotia&#8217;s board. It was started by concerned government employees who wanted to get people buying fresh peas instead canned ones. The current incarnations is an ultra dynamic group of citizens, industry members AND GOVERNMENT partners. In my humble experience, the role of government tends to be about safety and preserving the status quo at best, and creating conditions that suit larger (short term) commercial interests at their worst. Innovation is not typically on the list.

Between what came out of the session and what I heard sitting through their AGM afterwards, the interests and make-up of this organization, combined with their largely unadulterated traditional awesomeness offers a bright future for this place.

It left me wondering what other regions can do to recognize and preserve their charms? This place doesn&#8217;t need economic development so much as pedestals and platforms to put their trophies on.

And what can other regions do team up with government for innovation?

I&#8217;m going to think about it over a long vacation sitting by the ocean in Rose Bay and I&#8217;ll let you know what I come up with.
