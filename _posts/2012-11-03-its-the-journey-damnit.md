Came across this, felt compelled to watch it. And I&#8217;m glad I did.  
You won&#8217;t regret slowing down and watching it. 

Will it fly? Does it matter? Those who believe it will enjoy how they feel for as long as they do.  
I guess people who don&#8217;t dream in technicolor don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re missing, but I can&#8217;t help feeling sorry for them.

I hope it reminds you that whatever you&#8217;re working on, the pain is a privilege too. And I hope it inspires you to keep on creating.
