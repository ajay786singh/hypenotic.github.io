And the problem will only get worse. Inboxes will get fuller. More people will be able to send more email from more devices.

One could argue that email&#8217;s benefits are being eroded.

Indeed, people have been seeking the holy grail of &#8220;[inbox zero][2]&#8221; since 2006.

If the deluge isn&#8217;t going to stop, something else has to change. And that something else has to be our relationship with email. We&#8217;re going to have to put it back in it&#8217;s place.

Sounds hard, right? Well a new app I&#8217;ve been using is helping. [Mailbox][3] seems to be working because it addresses habit change, not just email.

Mailbox&#8217;s premise is:

*   You should control email, not the other way around.
*   Your inbox is for new information; It&#8217;s not a to-do list, and it&#8217;s not an archive.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The shift I&#8217;m making is from &#8216;checking&#8217; my email to &#8216;processing&#8217; it.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I find I&#8217;m more inclined to schedule &#8216;processing&#8217; email as an activity, where I answer, delete, delegate, ask for it to come back later or file my emails in lists.
