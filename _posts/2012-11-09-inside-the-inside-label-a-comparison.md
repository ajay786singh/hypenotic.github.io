Here&#8217;s a snapshot of two different clothing labels I found on the inside of my 5 year olds&#8217; clothing.

The first is from the [Patagonia ][1]jacket I invested in to keep her warm all winter long. What does this label say to you? Here&#8217;s a clue&#8211;they expect the jacket to be handed down, so they offer two places for children&#8217;s names to be written. (Can we all do a collective awwwwwwww!)

  The second is from a fancy-shmancy store, the new Lululemon kids&#8217; store <a href="http://www.ivivva.com/">Ivivva Athletica</a> in Oakville that my darling mother (my kids&#8217; granny)<a href="http://www.ivivva.com/"> </a>schlepped them to when were were on vacation, because she&#8217;s a fashionista.

  What does this label tell you? And remember, it&#8217;s a five year old&#8217;s garment.

  Can you just picture my five year old on a hot pink glittery cell phone:
</p>

>   Pippa: &#8220;You mean the pink top? Yeah it&#8217;s mine. I&#8217;ll be right over on my scooter!&#8221;
> </p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I leave it to you to assess the values embedded in these clothing labels. But it&#8217;s worth noting that both brands are taking every opportunity to make an impression&#8211;it&#8217;s just that the impression they make is dramatically different.
