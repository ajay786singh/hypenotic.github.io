Debt is so ubiquitous, it&#8217;s become invisible. It&#8217;s just an inevitable part of &#8220;owning&#8221; a home or a car, funding our holiday shopping or getting an education.

But debt can be a huge issue when it leads to foreclosures, bankruptcy and people basically losing their lives and their shirts.

Alarm bells have definitely started to sound here in Canada, but for our friends south of the border, things are much, much worse.

In the US, student debt has topped $1 Trillion. 62% of all bankruptcies are caused by medical illness. What&#8217;s even more startling is that the average American household has debts of around 154% their annual income.

Enter the People&#8217;s Bailout: [The Rolling Jubilee][1].

The Rolling Jubilee—whose name stems from the biblical sense of the term &#8220;Jubilee&#8221;, meaning &#8220;an event in which all debts are cancelled and all those in bondage are set free&#8221;—has been organized by [Strike Debt][2], an offshoot of [Occupy Wall Street][3].

Typically, banks sell debt for pennies on the dollar to debt buyers who then turn around and claim the full amount from debtors. The Rolling Jubilee is a project that hopes to abolish this practice, all the while dissolving the current debt crisis America is facing today in a totally unique and ground breaking way by using social crowd funding.

> &#8220;Together we can liberate debtors at random through a campaign of mutual support, good will, and collective refusal. Debt resistance is just the beginning. Join us as we imagine and create a new world based on the common good, not wall street profits.&#8221;

The Rolling Jubilee is primarily focussing on social media as a means of spreading the word. There are links to tweet at specific celebrities who have a large following on the web, urging them to join the cause and tweet to the masses. There is also a Facebook and/or Twitter pledge that sends out a message once per day advertising the cause.

To date, The Rolling Jubilee has raised $381,772. That means that is has also abolished $7,640,258 of debt all while keeping banks and debt collectors at bay.

If you are interested in participating, check out [rollingjubilee.org][1] and join the cause.
