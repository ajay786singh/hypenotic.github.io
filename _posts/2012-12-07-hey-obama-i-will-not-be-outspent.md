According to the article, most came as the result of fund-raising emails.

They rigorously tested the subject lines. The best were informal, conversational, almost personal.

Examples:

*   Hey (the most effective)
*   I will be outspent
*   Would love to meet you
*   Change
*   The one thing the polls got right&#8230;

The emails were extensively A-B split tested.

“We were so bad at predicting what would win that it only reinforced the need to constantly keep testing,” Amelia Showalter, director of digital analytics, is quoted as saying.

Headlines, copy, the amount asked for, all were rigorously written and re-written by a team of 20 writers. Then tested on small segments of the campaign&#8217;s email list. The most successful would be sent to out to the whole list.

You may not have 20 writers.

But, the technology to measure and test whether what you write resonates with your community, educates and inspires and effectively moves you closer toward your organizational goals is available to you.

This article illustrates the notion that your work is never &#8216;done&#8217;.

Your website launch, your email blast, these are not events, but steps along a path. From which you&#8217;ll learn, adapt, adjust.

Have you been surprised by the response to your emails or your website? What lessons have you learned in the process? Please share below.
