Lake Eugenia, the largest inground lake in Ontario&#8217;s Grey County, owes its name to a woman who had a very special relationship to water. Eugénie de Montijo was married to Napoleon – III and was the last empress of the French and was a Spanish countess. Eugénie believed her son was miraculously cured from a fever after being sprinkled with water from the spring at Massabielle in Lourdes France.

Eugénie frequently visited the grotto and claimed to be in the grips of a divine power when in its presence.

The grotto of Massabielle, is still visited by more than six million visitors each year who share Eugénie&#8217;s belief in its miraculous healing powers.
