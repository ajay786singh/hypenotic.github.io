  <strong>Critical question</strong>. My boss wants me to write a blog post about myself &#8211; hopes/dreams/passions/skills/interests/favourite smell,etc. A little introduction.&nbsp;</p> <p>
    I’ll think of it as my coming out. Introducing the new kid -to the club (Hypenotic)- to the world (you at your computer).<br /> <a rel="attachment wp-att-4765" href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/4763/hello-hypenotic/attachment/picture-3-6"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4765" title="Picture 3" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Picture-3.png" alt="" width="379" height="461" /></a><br /> <strong>Risa Stone</strong>

    <strong>About:</strong> A Toronto girl, born and raised, well actually the suburbs, but close enough.<br /> A -once -upon -a -time thespian, slow -foodie at heart, market goer (Hypenotics very own -Jodi found me at one of<br /> Toronto’s most amazing farmers markets, Wychwood Barns) and lover of the french pastry shops, know as patisseries.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Patisserie of choice?</strong> Nadege (Queen West.)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Their white walls and over priced yet perfectly prepared, coloured macaroons just warm my little heart. Yes. Nadege is my <em>happy place</em>.

  <p>
    <strong>Skills?</strong> I can do a cart wheel with no hands (last time I completed an aerial successfully was 2 years ago &#8211; still contemplating another attempt)<br /> <strong>Athletic? </strong>depends on the day.<br /> <strong>Relationship?</strong> Yes.<br /> <strong>Dreams? </strong>Every night! ( I know what was really being asked of me, but no one actually wants to hear where I see myself in 5 years)<br /> <strong>Cynical?</strong> see above.<br /> <strong>Favourite Smell?</strong> my mother’s house- while she’s cooking soup, preferably beef and barley.

    <strong>Why Hypenotic? </strong>They’re picky- and in an era of information overload their commitment to contemporary, meaningful marketing sets them apart.
