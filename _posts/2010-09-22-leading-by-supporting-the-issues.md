Participating in [The Weekend to End Women&#8217;s Cancers][1] was an incredibly moving experience. The 12 members of the Cancer is Crap team joined together to remember and celebrate [Leanne. ][2]It was an uplifting and inspiring event.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-2970" href="http://hypenotic.com/meaningfulmarketing/2905/leading-by-supporting-the-issues/attachment/screen-shot-2010-09-22-at-4-55-06-pm"><img class="size-med wp-image-2970 alignleft" title="Screen shot 2010-09-22 at 4.55.06 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Screen-shot-2010-09-22-at-4.55.06-PM.png" alt="" width="584" height="475" /></a>

The event was a success because of many people–the walkers, the donors, the volunteers, and of course, the sponsors.

We know that corporate sponsors don&#8217;t only have altruistic reasons for getting behind events, but we hope that their intentions are mostly good. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with a &#8220;win-win&#8221; that benefits both the corporate donor and the cause.

While corporate sponsorship has an important role in charity events, there&#8217;s a very line that must be tread. When people are engaged in an authentic and meaningful experiences, marketing messages that make participants feel like the experience is manufactured are unwelcome.

I want to shine a light on two sponsorship mis-steps at the Weekend to End Women&#8217;s Cancers to demonstrate the importance of sponsors supporting events and issues from the sidelines. The key is letting the &#8220;halo effect&#8221; work its magic instead of being seen to wrestle with the cause for the limelight.

1. [Shoppers Drug Mart ][3]was the new, national sponsor for this year&#8217;s walk. In Toronto the walk wound its way through Toronto streets from the Princess Margaret gates all the way to Downsview Park and then back the following day.

The route was designed so that participants would walk by Shoppers&#8217; stores all along the route.

Granted, we were all walking 32K a day no matter where we walked, but it somehow made a lot of the walkers feel &#8216;duped.&#8217; And hell hath no fury like a woman with sore feet.

It was just a bad move for Shoppers to make walkers feel like the stores were dictating the route. It created a perception that people were being forced &#8220;out of their way&#8221; to be reminded that Shoppers was the sponsor.

Um, we already knew you sponsored the event Shoppers. And we were happy about that until you made yourself seem more important than the issue and all of the women walking in support of it. The best route to follow would have been to support the people who go to the ends of their driveways serving everything from Lemonade to pastries to support the walkers. Enable and support them by providing a &#8216;cheering kit&#8217; and you&#8217;ll have a true win win.

2. [Johnson and Johnson][4] hosted lunch on the first day of the walk. Lots of people needed Band Aids for sore, blistered feet while walking so the donations of Band Aids were obviously welcomed.

But J&J&#8217;s lunch also featured a Karaoke station featuring the old school jingle &#8220;I am Stuck on Band Aid &#8216;Cause Band Aid&#8217;s stuck on me!&#8221;

Someone thought it&#8217;d be a great idea to set up a karaoke booth at the rest stop and have J&J donate $1 to Women&#8217;s Cancers every time someone sang the Band Aid song into the microphone.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-2957" href="http://hypenotic.com/meaningfulmarketing/2905/leading-by-supporting-the-issues/attachment/screen-shot-2010-09-22-at-4-44-27-pm-2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2957" title="Screen shot 2010-09-22 at 4.44.27 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Screen-shot-2010-09-22-at-4.44.27-PM1.png" alt="" width="528" height="94" /></a>

The net effect? A bunch on tired, hungry women walkers had the distinct pleasure of hearing that damned jingle over and over when they had a moment&#8217;s rest before hitting the pavement again.

Rather than creating a positive impression, J&J created a negative one. A better solution? How about sponsoring the medic stations where walkers went to deal with their injured feet. How about hosting a karaoke station with uplifting songs like *&#8220;I will Survive&#8221;* and *&#8220;These Boots Were Made for Walking&#8221;* and posting videos to YouTube?

So how can a sponsor do good without being perceived as self-serving?

1.  **Stand Back.** Sponsors don&#8217;t need to be in the spotlight. In fact the more they are seen to be championing the issue without promoting themselves, the more positive perceptions they&#8217;ll create. That doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t have your name on the banner–it just means let the issue be first.
2.  **Be Seen to Support: **Sponsors can support causes by being seen &#8220;on the ground&#8221; walking, volunteering and pitching in. They can also support the cause by using their presence in the community to grow attendance at the event. Retail stores offer great opportunities to reach people. Sure it&#8217;s nice to have the brochures on the cash station, but what else can you do?
3.  **Be Useful**: What can you do to actually add value for the people who are busting their chops? If it&#8217;s not actually useful then why are you doing it? Consider what different audiences need during the course of an event–volunteers, walkers, family and friend supporters, etc.
4.  **Make the Most of the Event: **What can you do before, during and after to enhance the event. Most events are over in one day. That&#8217;s a pretty short lifespan. Consider what would be of value at other times.

There are as many ways to build relationships by supporting and promoting the people who participate in events as there are participants. Can anyone else think of any?
