  I was recently helping a client set up the <a title="Customizing Email Signup Forms in MailChimp" href="http://blog.mailchimp.com/customizing-email-signup-forms-in-mailchimp/">email newsletter capture form</a> for their website.
</p>

The client has a hyper-networked role, often attending conferences, presenting workshops and travelling to make connections and extend the reach and relevance of their organization.

The list of things they hoped to learn about their subscribers was considerable.

*   Name,
*   Email address,
*   City,
*   Organizational affiliation,
*   Professional affiliation,
*   And much more.

We agreed this was putting up a barrier to participation. That the more fields we put in the form, [the less likely people will be to sign up][1].

Given the nature of the client&#8217;s organization this information would be extremely valuable. And they hoped many would be happy to share it.

I think this presents a valuable opportunity for a marketer, as I&#8217;ll explain in a minute.

But first, realize that people don&#8217;t care about your newsletter. They don&#8217;t want to be on your list.

What they want is to get to know you better; to be part of your community; to gain insight and knowledge; to get the inside scoop.

They&#8217;re looking for value and connection.

Derek Halpern of Social Triggers [shares][2] how he gauges what his customers want to buy. He replies to every email subscription with the questionâ€¦

> &#8220;What are you struggling with?&#8221;

The question goes out by autoresponder, of course. He doesn&#8217;t write each of these emails individually. But he genuinely wants to know, and he responds to every reply he gets.

The point is, he&#8217;s engaging his followers in dialogue. He&#8217;s demonstrating interest in their needs and showing his commitment to create real value.

Value and connection. That&#8217;s why people are on your list.

With the help of the [autoresponder][3] built right into MailChimp (or whatever email provider you use) you can start a dialogue right now that invites connection.

Whether you&#8217;re selling, or growing a community of like-minded activists.

Instead of making people jump through hoops to get a dry impersonal email, your newsletter could be the beginning of a long and mutually fruitful relationship.

I&#8217;d love to hear whether you&#8217;ve tried anything like this. And where it&#8217;s taken you. Please share below.
