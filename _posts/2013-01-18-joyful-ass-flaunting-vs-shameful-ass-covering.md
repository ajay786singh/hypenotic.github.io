I didn&#8217;t watch the Lance/Oprah interview last night. Still, all this talk of confessions, apologizing and backtracking has me craving figures who have massive quantities integrity. In other words, I want to spend my time thinking about those supreme beings who engage in full-on, joyful ass flaunting as opposed to shameful, pathetic ass covering.

Lance Armstrong and Paul Simon have something interesting in common; Oprah Winfrey. Lance appeared in his first &#8220;confessional&#8221; interview on Oprah&#8217;s OWN network last night. In other news, Oprah has publicly declared [Paul Simon&#8217;s Graceland ][1]her favorite album. Good taste lady.

Over the holidays I watched a mind-blowing PBS documentary about Paul Simon&#8217;s making of Graceland called [Under African Skies][2] which coincided with the album&#8217;s 25th Anniversary.

There was a slew of controversy about Graceland when it was released. The most damning accusation levelled at Simon was that because he flew to Johannesburg to record Graceland during apartheid, he broke a UN Boycott that banned artists from performing in the country. Dali Tambo, the South African co-founder of [Artists Against Apartheid][3] believed that Simon recording in South Africa served as an endorsement of South Africa&#8217;s racist, cruel politics.

Simon disagreed. He didn&#8217;t just disagree, he joyfully flaunted his beliefs in a glorious display of integrity.

Simon adamantly believed that a tour featuring South African music and artists could generate awareness and mobilize people to put an end to the apartheid regime.

So, instead of apologizing, retracting or making concessions about his trip to South Africa, Simon invited South African legend and anti apartheid activists [Miriam Makeba ][4]and [Hugh Masekela][5] to join his tour. Coupled with the incredible talents of[ Ladysmith Black Mambazo][6] and Simon himself, the tour brought music and people together in a revolutionary way.

So, here&#8217;s to you Paul Simon (now I feel like I&#8217;m channeling Jian Ghomeshi&#8217;s)  for being a man of integrity, willing to joyfully flaunt your principles in the face of a challenge. Whether you think he was right or wrong, you gotta respect someone who goes forward instead of backward when put under siege.

Check out Simon performing in Zimbabwe in 1987 where thousands of South Africans crossed the border to revel in Paul Simon&#8217;s triumphant, musical revolution.
