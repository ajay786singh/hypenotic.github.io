I recently read [an interview][1] highlighting [Terry Beech][2], Co-Founder and CEO of [HiretheWorld.com][3]. HiretheWorld  is essentially a freelance designer market where hundreds of designers compete for projects. There are a lot of discussions for and against this particular business model, but that&#8217;s for another post.

What was the striking about the interview were the similarities between Beech&#8217;s Action Plan, my own, and that of Hypenotic&#8217;s.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>1. &#8220;Have an intense focus on value creation&#8221;</strong><br /> You should always focus on what you can do to improve a person&#8217;s life rather than think about the fastest way to make a dollar. When you provide value and care to your customers, the money will always follow. Something that our clients love is that we, at Hypenotic are determined to help our clients to truly understand the thought process behind their projects. In the end, they get the very best solution—even if that means having to change the original request.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  One could argue that &#8220;the customer is always right&#8221;, and yes one needs to keep an open mind. However, it is a designer&#8217;s obligation to provide their clients with the tools and knowledge necessary to get the most out of their projects. If that means suggesting an alternative solution, you shouldn&#8217;t be afraid to speak your mind in a professional and respectful manner. Your clients will most definitely respect you in return. Ours do.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>2. &#8220;Surround yourself with amazing people who love what they do&#8221;</strong><br /> This is something I&#8217;ve found really makes a difference in your career and life as a whole. Surrounding yourself with like-minded, focused, and driven people will ensure that you are always pushing your boundaries and striving to improve yourself in everything you do. If you want to be more creative, surrounding yourself with creative individuals will in almost all situations inspire you to be the same.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  As a company, Hypenotic surrounds itself with passionate clients who all have a positive message or focus on improving the community as a whole. As a result, we as a team become just as passionate about the work we do since we know it is making a direct impact on the world we live in.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>3. &#8220;Do not fear what others think of you because it will keep you from taking risks&#8221;<br /> </strong>You may regret the risks that go badly, but you will most definitely always regret not taking the risks you wanted to take because you were playing it safe. In the words of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_School_Bus">Ms. Frizzle</a> (yes, I definitely just aged myself there) &#8220;<em>Take chances, make mistakes, and get messy&#8221; </em>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Obviously you should trust your instincts on taking what to you are intelligent risks in life. Always keep in mind that taking a risk also means growing as an individual, and as such allowing positive change into your all aspects of your life—including your career.

Just in case you&#8217;d like to improve upon your already awesome self, here&#8217;s an excerpt from the 2011 SFU Alumni Association&#8217;s Annual Gathering, where Beech goes into greater detail on the steps that you can take to be even more awesome.
