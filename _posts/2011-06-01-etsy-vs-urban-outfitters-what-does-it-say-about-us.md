A small pendant, shaped like a state with a heart in it. What started as a symbol of patriotic love quickly became an absurd icon of overseas mass production and its dark flip side, conspicuous consumption.

In case you haven&#8217;t heard, last week Twitter exploded when designer and blogger [Amber Karnes][1] accused  [Urban Outfitters][2] of stealing Etsy artist [Stevie Koerner&#8217;s ][3]necklace design and called for a boycott.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-5479" href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/5478/etsy-vs-urban-outfitters-what-does-it-say-about-us/attachment/screen-shot-2011-05-31-at-10-13-35-pm"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5479" title="Screen shot 2011-05-31 at 10.13.35 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-31-at-10.13.35-PM.png" alt="" width="350" height="60" /></a>As a result of the tweet, #UrbanOutfitters was an international trending topic and Karne&#8217;s post—featuring photos of the original necklace and the rip off—was [clicked on 260,000 times.][4]

I was one of the folks who retweeted her post. I was a bit outraged, but not surprised that Urban Outfitters would capitalize on the &#8220;small is the new big&#8221; trend by stealing artists&#8217; ideas. Turns out this isn&#8217;t the first time, either. In fact, the site [Urban Counterfeiters][5] is dedicated to the issue.

According to Karnes, it took Urban Outfitters *six hours* to come up with this response to the allegations on Twitter. Six hours is a long time in the Twitterverse. Fifteen minutes after Amber&#8217;s post went up she already had hundreds of responses on Twitter.[ ][6]Someone at UO was clearly sleeping on the job.

  <a rel="attachment wp-att-5481" href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/5478/etsy-vs-urban-outfitters-what-does-it-say-about-us/attachment/screen-shot-2011-05-31-at-10-27-32-pm"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5481" title="Screen shot 2011-05-31 at 10.27.32 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-31-at-10.27.32-PM.png" alt="" width="400" height="62" /></a>But before you can say &#8220;authenticity&#8221; the story takes an interesting turn. <a href="http://www.regretsy.com/2011/05/27/urban-outrage/">Regretsy,</a> a site that pokes fun at Etsy&#8217;s overwrought earnestness and its occasional missteps,  wrote a response to the UO debacle focusing on Etsy artists&#8217; habit of stealing from <em>eachother. </em>In fact, Regretsy claimed that the original necklace design came not from Stevie Koerner, but from James Avery, another Etsy artist who had a design similar to Koerner&#8217;s on Etsy a year prior.
</p>

Yesterday [Urban Outfitters finally responded,][7] referring to the Regretsy post and the fact that Koerner wasn&#8217;t the first to come up with this idea. So the fact that Etsy artists steal from eachother helped UO squeak out of a tough spot. And now we&#8217;re caught in a circular argument that comes back to the very idea of originality. Who knows how the idea began and who owns it. And frankly, who cares.

Rather than trying to suss out who-did-what-to-whom, I&#8217;m far more interested in what this issue says about us as a culture and our fascination with the concept of originality. Here are my thoughts on what the Etsy vs. Urban Outfitters debacle says about us:

**1. We long for the authentic. **The idea of the hand rendered item is why[ Etsy sold 180.6 million ][8]worth of goods last year. We still believe there&#8217;s something magical about artists making stuff with their hands. The power and aura of the handmade thing-y resonates. I think it&#8217;s a belief worth holding onto, even if artists sometimes behave badly.

2. **Faux Authenticity has a price. **I&#8217;ve written about &#8216;[Faux Authenticity&#8217; on this blog ][9]in relation to Restoration Hardware. The same rules apply here. If you&#8217;re shopping at Urban Outfitters you are buying cheaply made, mass produced crap made at someone else&#8217;s expense. Even if that thing you&#8217;re buying looks so cute, original and funky. Even if they call it &#8220;vintage.&#8221; Maybe it&#8217;s an artist who&#8217;s getting screwed, maybe it&#8217;s a factory worker, maybe it&#8217;s the environment. But rest assured, someone along the food chain is getting it, but good.

I don&#8217;t feel the same way about buying on Etsy.

**3. The Tension Between Worlds Makes Culture Interesting**

** **Urban Outfitters has[ 433,561 Twitter followers][10].

Check their Twitter stream. Urban Outfitters interacts with its community like crazy—they prescribe what to wear and how to decorate your &#8220;apartment&#8221; (not home on the UO site)—curated the UO way. Their site offers &#8220;room by room&#8221; ideas for everything from [Industrial Living Room ][11]to [Bohemian Bedroom. ][12] [Bohemian][13] and Industrial style &#8220;in a box&#8221; seems incongruous to me.

Check out this Tweet responding to [@IwishIhadtaste][14] (check the Twitter handle. You can&#8217;t make this stuff up). She is also &#8220;Follower of Kim Kardashian&#8217;s Every Move&#8221;

<a rel="attachment wp-att-5482" href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/5478/etsy-vs-urban-outfitters-what-does-it-say-about-us/attachment/screen-shot-2011-05-31-at-11-08-52-pm"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5482" title="Screen shot 2011-05-31 at 11.08.52 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-31-at-11.08.52-PM.png" alt="" width="519" height="80" /></a>At the same time as @iwishihad taste is taking design advice from UO, Etsy&#8217;s business is booming. They feature over 1 million sellers—some who make stuff, some who find stuff (some who steal stuff, I guess).

You can buy clogs from Germany (I did!), a [crocheted beach bag][15] and a [vintage kitty planter][16] all in the same place. It&#8217;s a relatively unmediated site where people make stuff and people buy stuff. It&#8217;s a DIY spirited movement that tells people they can have their own style, their own &#8220;thang&#8221; and succeed.

I know it&#8217;s not pure, but nothing is.

Bottom line is I can&#8217;t help feeling like Etsy&#8217;s success is somehow a reaction to the Urban Outfitters of the world. But is the reverse true? Whatever the case, it looks like the tension between these two worlds is what will keep both businesses in business for a good, long time.
