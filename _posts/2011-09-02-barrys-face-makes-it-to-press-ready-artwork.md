Check out what was embedded in my email from Beau&#8217;s Jordan Bamforth. It&#8217;s a real life mock-up ( think that&#8217;s an oxymoron) of our Hypenotic mascot in the [pose selected by you][1], our faithful readers way back in May.

The good news is that Beaus has put a significant enough dent in their palatte of caps to get the press ready artwork ready to produce the next batch. Here&#8217;s a preview of the magic behind the cap.

You&#8217;re still about 6-8 weeks away from being able to purchase one of the 100,000 Barry Brew Beaus Beers at your local LCBO.  But if you&#8217;re looking for your fix of Beaus before that, I suggest you head to [Beaus&#8217; Oktoberfest][2] from September 30th to October 2nd. Obviously ones for creative thinking, [Beau&#8217;s events ][3]will include

*   Keg toss
*   Spouse carrying race (we&#8217;re in training for that one)
*   100 pounds of playdough and Doo-Doo the clown for the kiddies

  We&#8217;ll keep you posted on the beer caps and some fun opportunities to get involved once they&#8217;re on store shelves.
