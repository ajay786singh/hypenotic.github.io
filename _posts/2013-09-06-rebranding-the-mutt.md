How would you like to adopt a &#8220;Chubby-tailed German Dobernauzer&#8221;? Or how about an &#8220;Alaskan Collie Fluffyterrier&#8221;?

These are just two of the fantastic names that canine experts in Costa Rica have given the unique breeds found at the rescue centre [Territorio de Zaguates][1].

This amazing organization can get up to 600 dogs at a time, and while the rise of pups in their care rises, the number of adoptions doesn&#8217;t. The problem? About 94% of the dogs in their care are Mixed Breeds. And while still adorable, when it comes down to choosing a pet, they are <del>branded</del> considered &#8220;less valuable&#8221;.

## &#8220;What could be of more value, than a dog that because of it&#8217;s mix, is like no other?&#8221;

By deciphering the present breeds in some of the shelter&#8217;s dogs, unique breeds were born.

The shelter appeared on a well-known television program to showcase these new, unique breeds, hoping to gain some interest in their dogs. Their message: &#8220;When you adopt a Mutt, you adopt a Unique Breed&#8221;.

The results couldn&#8217;t have been better! People are loving the dogs. Just after 45 days of airing their campaign, Adoption rates shot up 1,400%, 100% of the costs of running the shelter are now covered by sponsors, and <del>Mutts</del> Unique Breeds are now attending dog shows (a place where only pure-breeds were allowed before).
