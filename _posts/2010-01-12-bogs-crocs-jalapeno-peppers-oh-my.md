I bought myse<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1723" title="Screen shot 2010-01-12 at 10.47.58 AM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Screen-shot-2010-01-12-at-10.47.58-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2010-01-12 at 10.47.58 AM" width="109" height="115" />lf and my kids these groovy new winter boots called [Bogs][1]. There&#8217;s a lot of [technology][2] involved in creating a boot that looks and functions like a rainboot but keeps your feet warm and dry in the coldest, wettest weather. The Bogs phenomenon has been spreading like crazy. I predict they&#8217;ll be the next [Crocs. ][3] The comparison to Crocs is not incidental. What makes both these shoes so unique is that they don&#8217;t look like other shoes. Both Crocs&#8217; and Bogs&#8217; uniqueness is accentuated by their use of bold colours and graphics. The take-away message is &#8220;I&#8217;m a little different. And I want you to notice.&#8221;

In a recent post[ Seth Godin][4] talks about what it must have been like to talk about the [jalapeño pepper][5] when it first arrived in the new world. The question &#8220;What&#8217;s it like?&#8221; would have been incredibly difficult to answer. A jalapeno is not like a capsicum and not like black pepper. Similarly, Crocs are not sandals or gardening shoes and Bogs are not rainboots or traditional winter boots. And if they were, they wouldn&#8217;t be nearly as interesting, chatworthy or popular as they are.

Like Seth says: &#8220;What&#8217;s it like? leads to sequels and high concepts and crossovers, but it doesn&#8217;t get us 1966 Bob Dylan or even yoga class.&#8221; Also, importantly, &#8220;What&#8217;s it like?&#8221; leads to amazing conversations that make ideas spread like wildfire. I can say that my Bogs have given me entree into more conversations than any object of clothing I have *ever* worn. And, I&#8217;m happy to tell people &#8220;yes, they are warm&#8221; &#8220;yes, they keep my feet dry&#8221; &#8220;yes, they are soooooo comfortable (&#8220;like slippers&#8221; I tell them.)&#8221; At this point, I&#8217;ve sold so many Bogs they should be sending me a kickback.

When something isn&#8217;t like anything else, the best response (as Seth says) is &#8220;It&#8217;s not like anything. You need to trust me and just taste it.&#8221; Or, in my case, wear it. Conversations are the most powerful form of advertising. Who you gonna listen to? A mom with 2 kids hanging out at the gymnasium or an ad in a parenting magazine?  One is a dynamic, two way discussion where you can answer the &#8220;What&#8217;s it like&#8221; question. The other is a static, push approach that doesn&#8217;t allow for meaningful engagement.
