If you&#8217;re very active online and spend a good deal of time on subject-matter blogs and forums, you may frequently find yourself signing up for [email newsletters][1] and email blog updates that are of interest to you.

In addition to following content that&#8217;s relevant and useful to your business, signing up for other people&#8217;s newsletters can be a stealthy way to observe how other people engage your followers.

Call it marketing research.

But, no matter how interested you may be in the subject matter of your subscribed newsletters, you are bound to occasionally find yourself with far too much to read.

All those newsletters may feed your mind, but the constant barrage risks keeping you from the most important tasks at hand.

In a fit of overwhelm, your impulse may be to simply unsubscribe from your email lists and &#8216;start fresh&#8217;.

On the other hand, if you&#8217;ve spent time building up a list of valuable resources, this may not be practical or desirable.

Here&#8217;s a method I have found to help me filter these emails out of my consciousness until I&#8217;ve got some free time to focus on them:

#### 1. Create a Bacn folder

In contrast to spam, which is unsolicited email,Â [bacn is email you want][2]. It&#8217;s just not your highest priority.

#### 2. Filter it

Create a filter that reroutes email directly to your bacn folder and out of your inbox. This reduces your inbox clutter, while ensuring you won&#8217;t miss a precious issue.

#### 3. Schedule it

Find time in your hectic schedule just for reading your bacn. This could be a designated time in the afternoon or sometime outside of work.

Like those water-stained back issues of People magazine that sit on the tank in your bathroom, bacn is a treat best savoured on your own time.

#### 4. Share it

If you haven&#8217;t unsubscribed, it must be worth your attention. Share your emails with colleagues and friends &#8211; preferably on your blog or social networks (wouldn&#8217;t be fair to clog someone else&#8217;s inbox) &#8211; and become a trusted curator of useful information in the process.

### When overwhelm sets in

Sigh. Sometimes you just have to hit &#8216;delete&#8217;. Like the blowout party you missed last weekend, remind yourself that there will, indeed, always be more.

### Quick tip

A lot of our clients use [Google Apps for Business][3] to host their email. GAfB/Gmail makes it easy to create filters for your bacn (check under the &#8216;mail settings&#8217; menu).

If you want to create one filter for several newsletter, use this syntax:

> FROM: (newsletter1 OR newsletter2 OR newsletter3 OR so on)

Don&#8217;t forget to include the brackets and &#8216;OR&#8217; must be capitalized.

Now you have all your bacn tucked away in one folder for relaxed noshing when you actually have the time.

Now&#8230;if I could only figure out how to put the rest of the Web in my bacn folder my life would be truly distraction free.
