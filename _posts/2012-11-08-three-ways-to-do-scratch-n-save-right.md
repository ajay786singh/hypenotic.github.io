This promotion from World Wildlife Fund reinterprets the &#8216;Scratch N&#8217; Save&#8217; concept so brilliantly, I just had to share.

When I first saw what looked like your typical cheesy Scratch &#8216;N&#8217; Save promotion tucked into my daughter&#8217;s [Chirp Magazine][1] I was mildly appalled at the audacity of sending sales materials with a child&#8217;s educational magazine.

Then, I scratched, because scratching that shiny stuff off is fun&#8211;right?

 This WWF promotion to encourage people to symbolically adopt a snowy owl, gorilla, bear, otter or leopard is smart on many levels:

*   **It Plays On Familiar Tropes:** The piece subtly reminds the viewer that consumerism doesn&#8217;t create the kind of warm and fuzzy feelings you get when you donate to save a species. They don&#8217;t hit you over the head with the message, but by using the tropes of consumer culture they get their point across
*   **It Exploits the Fact that People want to Interact: **Scratch N&#8217; Saves are fun. Humans like to interact with things and manipulate them. In fact I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a whole psych dissertation on this subject somewhere, but I haven&#8217;t read it. But we can all agree on this basic principal.
*   I**t Makes Critical Connections:** Not only  does your symbolic adoption of an animal save the animal, but WWF takes the time to demonstrate the connection between saving animals, preserving their habitats and the wellbeing of the planet.

What will you be buying your loved one this holiday season. Reward WWF and the planet by [giving the gift of a symbolic adoption][2]&#8211;your donation even comes with an adorable plush version of the animal, and an adoption certificate.
