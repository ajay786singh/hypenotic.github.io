As you may already know from my [previous post][1], Im a huge fan of [Neil Gaiman][2]. Not only is he a brilliant author, but he&#8217;s also a fascinating and [inspirational person][3].

One of his most recent projects, is nothing short of exceptional.

> &#8220;On February 4th 2013, Neil Gaiman embarked on a fantastic art project in partnership with [BlackBerry][4] and millions of his fans. He tweeted twelve questions to the world, one for each month of the year. From the tens of thousands of responses he received,  Neil picked his favourite answers and wrote twelve short stories inspired by them.&#8221;

  <a href="http://acalendaroftales.com/"><img title="January" alt="Screen shot 2013-06-07 at 11.14.50 AM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-07-at-11.14.50-AM-580x338.png" width="371" height="216" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">
    @neilhimself asked: “Why is January so dangerous?”<br />@zyblonius replied: “Because an aging veteran just retired, to be replaced by a dangerously unqualified youth, no more than a babe in arms.”

Equipped with twelve brand new stories, Neil reached out to his fans so that they might collaborate on his new project. The result? Thousands upon thousands of fans submitted a staggering collection of beautiful illustrations and videos to help create an incredible mix of words and images.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">
  &#8220;Good fiction unites us, and this project is no exception&#8221;.
</h3>

I love collaborative, multidiscipline projects. Artwork aside, the website itself is stunning from a UX approach. You&#8217;ve got total freedom to explore the entire series by downloading the stories or listening to them, as well as viewing the artwork and watching the videos that fans have created. I guess the only thing I don&#8217;t love, is that its also a bit of a plug for Blackberry&#8230;but I can put that aside. Once you enter the calendar, you only have to tolerate a small blackberry logo in the top left corner.

    @neilhimself asked: “What&#8217;s the strangest thing that ever happened to you in February?”<br />@TheAstralGypsy replied: “Met a girl on beach, searching for her grandma&#8217;s pendant, lost 50 years ago. I had it, found previous Feb.”

As you go through the months, the background animates to better reflect that time of the year. So while January is a bit gloomy, May has flowers beginning to appear on the trees and float in the brighter sky.

Styles vary from photography, mixed medium, painting, and illustration. All unique, and all amazing. I highly recommend you [check it out][5].
