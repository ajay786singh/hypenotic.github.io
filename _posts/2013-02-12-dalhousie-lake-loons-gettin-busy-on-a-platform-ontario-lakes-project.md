Of course, that the call of loons in fundamental to the Ontario lake experience. Their haunting calls are the perfect soundtrack to a relaxing evening at the cottage. Even though they are the symbol of utter relaxation, it turns out these birds are quite stressed. This is not good news. Loons&#8217; nests are easily impacted by rising water levels, power boats and shoreline development. This has the Dalhousie Lake dwellers taking a DIY approach to providing them refuge.

A volunteer member of the [Dalhousie Lake Association][1] has shared information on building a [DIY Loon Nesting Platform][2] to be an inviting and safe habitat for loon populations. Turns out, all you need are cedar log, vinyl-coated chain-link fence, two anchors or cinder blocks and stuff for the nest&#8211;like straw, bulrushes, long grasses, etc.

In this NSFW video, two loons demonstrate just how comfy the platform can be by &#8220;gettin&#8217; it on&#8221; (albiet briefly) on an artificial platform. Even the loons know how to keep the love life fresh.
