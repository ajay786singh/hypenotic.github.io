<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1784" title="photo-1" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/photo-1.jpg" alt="photo-1" width="216" height="288" />I attended the [Field & Fork Network&#8217;s][1] [Farmer-Chef Conference][2] held in Western New York yesterday. Farmers in this particular area of NY (like many others) have been driven to the brink of bankruptcy and [worse.][3]

[][3] The Conferences&#8217; main objective was to explore how farmers, who make locally produced food, can get their food into the hands of consumers and make a living for themselves and their families.

Early in the day, one of the keynote speakers, [Patrick Martins][4] from [Heritage Foods USA ][5] and[ Slow Food USA ][6]spoke about the importance of *taste* in the Slow Food movement. He remarked that

> Slow Food and it&#8217;s founder [Carlo Petrini ][7] advocated eating locally insofar as local food tended to taste better. The priority for Slow Food is supporting the production of food that is &#8220;the best&#8221; whether it comes from the local terroir or from another locale.

Once you can show that your milk, cheese, lamb, etc. is the best, discussions about price, etc. become secondary. Martin&#8217;s emphasized that too often local food producers are satisfied with mediocrity when it comes to taste.

Martin&#8217;s comments resonated with me. I had just the night before read Seth Godin&#8217;s post on the [Ubiquity of Competition][8] where he concludes (in his uber-succinct Godin way)

> &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to like competition in order to understand that it exists. Your fair share isn&#8217;t going to be yours unless you give the public a reason to pick you.&#8221;

Local isn&#8217;t enough because there are many who can make stake to this claim. But, as Martin pointed out, &#8220;if a farmer can say [Mario Batali ][9]uses my apples in his apple pie, he&#8217;s got something to talk about.&#8221;

Later in the day I met Pat Manning from [Hudson Valley Fresh, ][10]a non-profit dairy cooperative made up of 9 farms who produce the highest quality milk for sale in the NY area. During his inspiring presentation, Pat focused on the fact that Hudson Valley Fresh&#8217;s milk is truly the freshest. And he can prove it. This milk has lower bacteria counts than other &#8220;dirty&#8221; milk. The milk is guaranteed 36 hours from cow to cup. The cows are treated better than cows on conventional dairy farms.

Why should you or I care about bacteria counts, travel time or how cows are treated? Manning has the answer; &#8221; The milk just plain tastes better.&#8221;  It tastes better than conventional milk, and it tastes better than other premium dairies (90 in the Hudson Valley region alone) who didn&#8217;t make the cut to be one of the 9 farms that provide milk for Hudson Valley Fresh. And farmers from one of his 9 farms are regulars in local shops and store sampling their milk to prove it.

As a consumer, we have many, many options to choose from. Food producers need to think about what they have that no one else can lay claim to.

Does your pork come from a heritage pig that has a distinct taste? Has your method of making scones been praised by Martha Stewart? Is your milk the favourite of baristas because it froths like none other?

> Being local is just the cost of entry. Once you&#8217;re at the Farmers&#8217; Market you&#8217;re stall to stall with others who share that claim to fame.

This is a tall order. Especially when you understand that farmers and food producers are already burdened with an incredible number of responsibilities. But from where I stand, the future of farming and food production lay with those who get that Ubiquity of Competition is inevitable. And only the unique will survive.
