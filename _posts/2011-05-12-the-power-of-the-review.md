<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4901" title="ThePowerofTestimonials_BlogPost_Graphic" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/ThePowerofTestimonials_BlogPost_Graphic.jpg" alt="" width="366" height="245" />For the past several weeks, I&#8217;ve been in the chaos of renovating a house from top to bottom. It has been an interesting journey especially from the perspective of finding and hiring competent contractors.  How DO you find contractors? Well, you could ask your friends and family, your neighbours or the route we eventually took&#8230;social media.

I&#8217;m guessing that even a few years ago, social media and the furnace guy wouldn&#8217;t be found in the same sentence. But the impact of social media online, specifically, *the review or testimonial* &#8211; one of the simpliest and earliest forms of &#8220;social media&#8221; &#8211; has become integral in seperating one contractor from the other sound bites fighting for online space in their respective industries.

> In fact, the review is so important to their business that we&#8217;ve had two contractors, a furnace guy and a cleaning crew all come in during the renovation and cut us a break on the price &#8220;if only we would write a good review of them on their website or facebook page. &#8220;

According to the cleaning crew, &#8220;that is how people find us now.&#8221; From a communications perspective and especially working at a company that specializes in social media and communication strategies, we often forget about the power of the &#8220;review&#8221;. &#8220;The only way to combat any negative reviews is to have clients write positive ones,&#8221; says the furnace guy. &#8220;The problem is that people only tend to write reviews when they are not happy and rarely write reviews for good service.&#8221;

From distant memory, I remember my old college professor saying that it only takes one bad review to counter ten positive ones. Even if you have ten great reviews, if the eleventh is bad it swings the pedulium and creates that seed of doubt in the reviewer&#8217;s mind that might push them to look elsewhere. So, if you are thinking about your social media strategy and how to get the word out try having your clients write a testimonial.  It could be that one thing that separates you from the herd.
