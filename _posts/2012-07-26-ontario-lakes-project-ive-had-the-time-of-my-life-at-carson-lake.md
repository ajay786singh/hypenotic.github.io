[Carson&#8217;s Camp][1] on Carson Lake at Sauble Beach has that Dirty Dancing Resort vibe. The place has a full-time recreation director whose job it is to organize activities for kids and families. The whole summer is organized into weekly themes. It&#8217;s just like Kellerman&#8217;s Resort in Dirty Dancing where Baby met Penny and Johnny and there was dancing and friendship and teen sex and&#8230;.

Don&#8217;t get me started.

I could write a whole Master&#8217;s thesis on Dirty Dancing. Actually, I did. Don&#8217;t believe me? [Here&#8217;s where you can get it][2] and read all about it yourself. Ohio State, Women&#8217;s Studies 1996 baby. Because of my thesis &#8220;Nobobdy Puts Baby in a Corner: Hybridity and Female Desire in Dirty Dancing,&#8221; I&#8217;m an expert in all-inclusive North American family oriented resorts, musicals and feminism.

Just like the good life at Kellerman&#8217;s, at Carson&#8217;s Camp there&#8217;s an indoor pool, an outdoor pool and BINGO, horseshoe pits, 3 playgrounds, golf practice nets, shuffleboard courts, chess & checkers courts, a beach volleyball court, basketball court and billiards.

You may even find a hidden-away shack where scantily clan teens illicitly bump and grind until the wee hours.

Oh, you&#8217;ll have the time of your life. But be sure to use birth control&#8230;.remember what happened to Penny?

Next week at Carson&#8217;s Lake is themed &#8220;Halloween week&#8221; (yes, for real.) Here&#8217;s a great Halloween costume and a great dance number featuring one guy as both Baby and Johnny. I&#8217;m dying over here.
