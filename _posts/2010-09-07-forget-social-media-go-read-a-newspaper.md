Here&#8217;s a fun tip for those still scaling the &#8220;I don&#8217;t get it&#8221; side of the social media peak. Particularly if part of of what&#8217;s challenging you is the way &#8220;updates&#8221; look.

The first rule you (should) learn on Twitter is that no one cares what you&#8217;re doing, unless who you are adds perspective to that activity. I care what chefs and farmers eat, but otherwise find meal updates are banal.

Hopefully it won&#8217;t be long after that that you learn to get off Twitter&#8217;s homepage and onto software (like [Tweetdeck][1], [Hootsuite][2], [Seesmic][3], [etc][4]) that makes it easier for you to process all the information and insight traded daily on the platform.

But if you&#8217;re not up to a professional tool, or learning something new isn&#8217;t an option for you right now, [paper.li ][5]is here to help.

It displays the content pointed to by the people you&#8217;re following as a newspaper. Something we&#8217;re all familiar with.

  <a rel="attachment wp-att-2866" href="http://hypenotic.com/socialmedia-2/2842/forget-social-media%e2%80%93go-read-a-newspaper/attachment/screen-shot-2010-09-07-at-3-30-17-pm"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2866" title="Paper.li_Twitter_As newspaper" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Screen-shot-2010-09-07-at-3.30.17-PM-580x528.png" alt="" width="580" height="528" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">
    My Twitter stream as a newspaper
  </p>
</div>

Beyond familiarity, it&#8217;s a nice way to process the information because:

*   you can see more of it before choosing to click the link to the source.
*   the articles are organized by category/subject matter for easy scanning

A more expensive alternative would be to get your hands on an ipad and download [Flipboard][6]. It helps turn Facebook&#8217;s horrendous interface into a pleasurable way to peruse news from your network. It also, (currently, though this must be changing soon), let&#8217;s you add up to seven other RSS streams to your personal newspaper. All beautifully rendered.

Will this be the thing that helps you start to appreciate Social Media?
