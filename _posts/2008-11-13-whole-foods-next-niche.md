Jackie Huba at the &#8220;Church of the Customer&#8221; Blog has an interesting discussion going on what Whole Foods might do for it&#8217;s next act. Now that your average chain offers organic, how can they compete without getting into a price-war.

She makes a good case for them to focus on special needs diets. it&#8217;s a large niche with multiple audiences and they have plenty of avenues to help.

We all know the benefits of a niche focus, but I wonder if WholeFoods specialty isn&#8217;t broader–an experience. Everything about the place communicates a passion and respect for food and nourishment. An diet related accessibilty program just seems to be a manifestation of that.
