Marketing&#8217;s hard work.

To make it pay off, you need to make it worth paying attention to.

Take your email newsletter, for instance.

If I get another email called &#8220;XYZ Newsletter: February 2012&#8243; I think I&#8217;ll scream.

Or, likely just hit *unsubscribe*.

Point is, if you want me to read your emails, you&#8217;ve gotta grab me by the eyeballs.

Compare the headline below to the one above:

> Rick, is this what you&#8217;re looking for?

See what I did there?

Using my favorite word (my name, natch), I got my attention.

Then, I asked a question that shows I care about what matters to me. And one that&#8217;s just begging for an answer, which I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll learn if I open the email.

Of course, this is just an example. The right headline to use will depend on the subject, what your audience cares about, and what you want them to do.

And it should come in your own voice.

An &#8220;e-newsletter&#8221; doesn&#8217;t have to be all stiff and formal and official. It can just be a conversation between people. You&#8217;re trying to build a relationship here.

And please remember that your marketing isn&#8217;t set in stone. It&#8217;s a laboratory. Test and measure and you&#8217;ll begin to see what people respond to.

In an upcoming email, I&#8217;ll show you how to do that. It&#8217;s easy.

And tell me: What compelling headline has come into your inbox lately that grabbed you by the peepers (and got you to open the email)?
