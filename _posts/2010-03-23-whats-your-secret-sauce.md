<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2100" title="Screen shot 2010-03-23 at 10.34.02 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Screen-shot-2010-03-23-at-10.34.02-PM.png" alt="Screen shot 2010-03-23 at 10.34.02 PM" width="170" height="188" />A couple weeks back I attended[ Inc. Magazine&#8217;s][1] [GrowCo Conference][2] in Orlando Florida. Brilliant entrepreneurs, from [Lexy Funk][3] to [Norm Brodsky][4] took to the stage to share the knowledge and insights they gleaned from years of experience building successful companies. Why do they share what they know? Because when they share they become *experts*.

Same goes for social media like Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, etc.  All these platforms exist to enable better sharing. In a meeting earlier today I was reminded that many people are still reluctant to give away too much information because they are afraid that someone else will steal their idea. Steal their idea? I say: Hoarding knowledge is dead. Long live sharing! Long live experts!

Today the idea of McDonalds  having a secret sauce just seems creepy and weird. And, by the way, the recipe for that oh -so-secret sauce [can be found online][5] along with  the [Caramilk secret][6] and [KFC&#8217;s eleven secret herbs and spices][7].

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2106" title="Screen shot 2010-03-23 at 10.48.41 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Screen-shot-2010-03-23-at-10.48.41-PM.png" alt="Screen shot 2010-03-23 at 10.48.41 PM" width="236" height="170" />On the last day of the GrowCo Conference, I had the pleasure of listening to Jason Fried from [37 Signals][8] give a talk on the need to rethink old ways of doing and thinking about business.  His new (brilliant and life-changing) book[ Rework][9] has a chapter dedicated to the importance of sharing. It&#8217;s called Emulate Chefs. He asks why chefs like [Mario Batali ][10]write cookbooks filled with their recipes, and yet they aren&#8217;t the least bit afraid that someone&#8217;s going to buy their cookbook and open a restaurant next door.  Because, as the authors say in their signature plain-speak &#8220;It just doesn&#8217;t work like that.&#8221;

Instead of keeping their secret sauce a secret, businesses need to &#8220;emulate famous chefs&#8221; by asking themselves the questions in Fried&#8217;s book:

> What do you do? What are your recipes? What&#8217;s your cookbook? What can you tell the world about how you operate that&#8217;s informative, educational and promotional?

If you can articulate what your secret sauce, your eleven herbs and spices are, you too can be an expert&#8211;write a book, have a prolific and well-trafficked blog, create a toolkit, take to the speaking circuit or just sell more of what you&#8217;re already selling. As Fried says &#8220;This is our cookbook. What&#8217;s yours?&#8221;
