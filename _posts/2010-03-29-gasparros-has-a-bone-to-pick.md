<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2114" title="Screen shot 2010-03-29 at 11.46.49 AM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Screen-shot-2010-03-29-at-11.46.49-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2010-03-29 at 11.46.49 AM" width="350" height="212" />[Vince Gasparro&#8217;s][1] is an unassuming, family-run butcher shop that looks pretty much like any other in downtown Toronto. Inside it&#8217;s a busy place that is even more packed since CBC&#8217;s [Matt Galloway][2] once again publicly proclaimed his affection (this time in [Toronto Life)][3] for this local meat shop.

In the middle of a bustling Saturday afternoon at Gasparro&#8217;s I got into a conversation with the youngest son Nick about Twitter. My insistence that Gasparro&#8217;s start using Twitter was met with Nick&#8217;s resistance &#8220;What do I need Twitter for?&#8221; he asked to a store full of enthusiastic customers. My tongue-in cheek-answer was simple &#8220;You know why you need to be on Twitter? Because [Sanagan&#8217;s Meat Locker ][4]in Kensington Market is on [Twitter][5]!&#8221;

Then the conversation turned to the meat. Gasparro&#8217;s claims to have grain fed, cage free chickens and all kinds of good quality meats. But, I was always stumped by the fact that their meat didn&#8217;t have any familiar  brand name on it ([Rowe Farm][6], [Kerr Farms][7], etc) that I associate with quality, naturally raised meat. Truth be told, I&#8217;ve always been a bit suspicious of Gasparro&#8217;s claims because of this absence.

The older brother Lino jumped in &#8220;*You&#8217;re a victim of marketed meat!*&#8221; he said as the younger brother quickly ushered me to the meat locker. Now, I&#8217;ve never been inside a meat locker before, and I must say I was quite stunned to find animals, some with their fur still on, hanging from their hooves waiting to be butchered. The brothers then explained that much of the meat at Gasparro&#8217;s comes from their father&#8217;s farm.

Hearing this on the heels of the &#8220;What do I need Twitter for?&#8221; question was particularly ironic. Apparently, there&#8217;s an amazing story to tell at Gasparro&#8217;s and I just caught this tip of it. But, most importantly, it seems the boys at Gasparro&#8217;s have a needle they want to move in the world. When Lino said &#8220;You&#8217;ve a victim of marketed meat&#8221; he was picking a fight&#8211;and we *love* when our clients want to pick a fight. He was standing up and saying &#8220;you think the only meat that&#8217;s good is the one that says Rowe farm on it. I got good meat, and it doesn&#8217;t say anything on it &#8217;cause it comes from my dad&#8217;s farm.&#8221;

He&#8217;s right. He&#8217;s got my attention. Now imagine how the boys at Gasparro&#8217;s could be using social media to take their fight public. They could do things like:

*   Show footage from the farm and talk about what make Gasparro&#8217;s meat different
*   A view inside the meat locker and why it looks different from other Butcher shops
*   Rants about marketed meat and why it bugs them
*   Updates on the latest cuts available in the shop ([A butcher shop in Brooklyn i][8]s doing this on Twitter with great success)
*   Link to other link minded folks who are working against marketed meat&#8211;even if it has a conscience

If you have a bone to pick (pun-intended) then you&#8217;ve got a story to share. Social media platforms are the best place for story telling because then the story can be shared, and attract followers who can transform your fight into a movement.

What needle do you want to move in the world? How are you going to galvanize an army to help you fight the good fight? How are you going to tell that story to avoid being misunderstood, or most importantly, ensure what you stand for is clear to those who would love you if you only told them.
