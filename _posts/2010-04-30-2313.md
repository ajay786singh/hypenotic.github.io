This, of course, is not a new question. It&#8217;s the question on every company&#8217;s lips as they begin considering devoting time + resources to social media.

For a small handful of businesses the ROI on social media is instantaneous. Inc. Magazine has summed up the [top 5 ways to make money, quickly, using Twitter][2]. So, [Threadless ][3]has sold loads of t-shirts turning Tweets into custom t-shirt messages, and [Kogi Korean BBQ ][4]Tweets where folks can find their food carts in LA, and people rush to the intersection to get their bulgogi fix.

Sorry to disappoint, but if your not a travelling food cart or t-shirt designer  you need to get over the need for instant gratification.

> <span style="font-style: normal;">What social media does is simply allow you to do one thing: communicate. That&#8217;s it. Social media is not the conversation. It&#8217;s the room in which you hold the conversation. It still comes down to saying, doing, or producing something valuable for your customer&#8230;.Companies that get it will find social media a valuable tool &#8212; if they they are prepared to stick it out and learn how it works.</span>

<span style="color: #222222;">Maltoni says that social media is the modern telephone. It is a communications portal, and like anything else in life, what you put in is what you get out. The value of the relationships you build on social media networks is the product of the time, energy and intelligence you&#8217;re willing to invest.</span>

<span style="color: #222222;">For <a href="http://www.zappos.com">Zappos </a>every single phone conversation is a meaningful relationship builder. How could you be having conversations on social media that build relationships? If you want to use this platform as a bullhorn spewing out information about yourself, I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ve missed the call of social media. </span>
