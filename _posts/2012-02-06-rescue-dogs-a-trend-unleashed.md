I&#8217;ve been meeting a lot of dogs lately. No surprise there (have you [met my new dog Blue?][1]) But what is surprising is the number of people who I meet who tell me their dogs are &#8220;rescues.&#8221; Not familiar with the term rescue? Wikipedia defines a rescue dog as:

> &#8220;A dog that has been rescued from possible euthanasia after being found as a stray, a dog that has been saved from an abusive or neglectful home by an animal rescue organization&#8230;.or a dog that is simply no longer wanted or can no longer be cared for by its owner&#8221;

It&#8217;s a huge trend. So big in fact last night&#8217;s Superbowl had a Bud Light ad featuring a rescue dog named &#8220;weego.&#8221; As the [Bud Light facebook page ][2]explains, for every &#8216;like&#8217; Weego receives $1 will be donated to [Tony La Russa&#8217;s Dog Rescue Foundation][3].  Listen, an issue doesn&#8217;t get much mainstream than that!  


Out for a walk with my pooch this morning I met a woman who said her Basset Hound was a rescue. When pressed, she said she got him at the pound, but he was* about* to be sent to a [Basset Hound Rescue.][4] There seems to be some caché in claiming your pup&#8217;s a rescue. So, I&#8217;m wondering, what&#8217;s behind it? Here are my thoughts;

1.  **Trend Toward Social Causes:**  [Dog Life Magazine ][5]sees the rescue dog trend as part of a &#8220;greater trend toward philanthropy and social causes.&#8221; In fact, the Executive Director of one pet adoption website sees it as akin to recycling: “People go out of their way to recycle a can. Why wouldn’t you go to recycle a life out of a shelter?” Not sure I&#8217;m feeling the recycling metaphor. But anyhoo&#8230;
2.  **Pets Seen as Self Indulgent:** In this context buying a dog from a breeder is seen as self-indulgent and possibly even unethical.  When Vice President Joe Biden bought a German Sheppard from a breeder he received intense push back. The [LA times did a survey][6] and among respondents &#8220;42% say that Biden made the right choice in purchasing from a breeder, while 31% say he should have adopted a rescued dog&#8221;
3.  **Two Words, &#8220;Cesar Millan&#8221;: **Dog training celebrity Cesar Millan has thrust rescue dogs into the spotlight. On his website [Cesarsway][7] Cesar regularly promotes rescues and the joy of rehabilitating dogs to give them a full and happy life. He also dramatizes harrowing dog rescues. Please note the music in the background in this video



4.** The rise of Dog Psychology:** There&#8217;s a current fascination about getting inside a dog&#8217;s mind (Or really any animal&#8217;s mind &#8211;think Temple Grandin)  The thinking goes that with the right kind of human understanding any dog can be rehabilitated&#8211;even a rescue. Central to this trend are people like[ Erica Ritter who has written novels from a dog&#8217;s perspective][8],  but also The Monks of Skeete who meticulously train German Sheppards in a Monestary in New Skeete New York. Check out this video below called What is a Dog?  where they say

> &#8220;you try and understand the dog as it really is and along with that you try to bring an intuitive element to your relationship with the dog that allows you to meet it on a new level, a deeper level&#8221;



**  
**So, what do you think is behind the whole rescue dog phenomenon? Has it been around and I&#8217;m just now noticing because I got a dog (did I tell you, [I got a dog?][1])

Do you have a rescue dog? If so, tell me what it&#8217;s all about.
