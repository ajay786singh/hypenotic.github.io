In 1991 [The Chicago Tribune][1]  called the sandy beaches of Attawapiskat Lake &#8220;The Ultimate Getaway.&#8221; A concept that the local Native population found downright absurd:

> They shake their heads at the idea that their town -reachable chiefly by plane from Pickle Lake and Fort Hope 300 miles north of Thunder Bay- represents perfect isolation, the* ultimate getaway*, an ideal jumping-off place for a burgeoning Indian-based tourism industry.
> 
> &#8216;People would come here just to rent boats, read books, lay on the beach and walk around watching natives do their thing,&#8217; a meeting of bemused Ojibway leaders is told.

Apparently Aboriginal Tourism is a growing field. A recently released report called [Aboriginal Tourism Development Strategic Plan for Northern Ontario][2] concluded that &#8220;more Aboriginal themed more demand-generating attactions are needed.&#8221;

And apparently, laying around watching Natives do their thing counts.

**UPDATE**

The irony of calling Attawapiskat Lake the Ultimate Getaway was intensified when @susana066 from Charlottetown PEI shared shocking video about horrible state of living conditions the Attawapiskat peoples are currently experiencing.

Please watch the video and sign [the petition ][3]asking the Minister of Indian Affairs to provide emergency funding for housing which is desperately needed as winter approaches.
