            Your mama was right. It matters who you choose to associate with. Stand in a crowd of smokers huddled outside an office building and most will assume you&#8217;re a smoker too. Even if all you&#8217;re doing is getting a breath of fresh (not so fresh?) air. Companies should follow this simple lesson which we all know from our own lives; as much as you can try and compartmentalize and intellectualize decisions, others don&#8217;t see it that way. People get an overall &#8220;gut&#8221; impression of who you are and what you stand for by the decisions you make.

              My most recent issue of <a href="http://www.good.is/">GOOD magazine</a> arrived yesterday. GOOD is a great publication featuring &#8220;a collaboration of individuals, businesses, and nonprofits pushing the world forward.&#8221; By it&#8217;s own admission, GOOD is &#8220;for people who give a damn.&#8221; But, the people they choose to hang out with do damage to the brand.

                Every month when my GOOD magazine arrives, I find myself disappointed by the Ralph Lauren Rugby ad on the back page of the magazine. I found this ad placement particularly disturbing during the recent <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/10/09/emboing-boingem-and-ralph_n_311593.html"><span style="color: #002bee; text-decoration: underline;">Ralph Lauren kerfuffle</span></a> when RL and his friends resisted taking responsibility for photoshopping a model who ended up looking so emaciated a <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2009/09/29/ralph-lauren-opens-n.html"><span style="color: #002bee; text-decoration: underline;">Boing Boing blogger </span></a>commented &#8220;Dude, her head is bigger than her pelvis.&#8221;
              </p>

                  It is tough being Good. Just ask a vegetarian. Take one step toward righeousness by reducing meat consumption and everyone wants to call you out on wearing leather shoes. Magazines wlike Cosmopolitan and Lucky don&#8217;t have GOOD&#8217;s issues. And, GOOD has had it&#8217;s share of financial difficulties and now only publishes four issues a year. However, that is the burden of trying to be GOOD. And, GOOD needs to suck that up.

                  <p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Verdana;">
                    I was particularly interested yesterday when the latest of GOOD included two letters to the editor criticizing GOOD for including advertisers such as the <a href="www.gap.com">Gap</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Methodist_Church">United Methodist Church</a> whose values were deemed inconsistent with those of the magazine. The editor&#8217;s response was as follows:
                  </p>
                  
                  <p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Verdana;">
                    <p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Verdana;">
                      <p style="font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Verdana; margin: 0px;">
                        <em>&#8220;GOOD is an advertising-supported business, because we believe that doing good can and must be financially as well as morally successful.That doesn&#8217;t mean we endorse all the practices of our advertisers</em>
                      </p>
                      
                      <p style="font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Verdana; margin: 0px;">
                        <em>(or, for that matter, that they endorse everything that appears in our pages.But if you&#8217;re upset with the policies of a business that suppotts us, make it clear to us,and more importantly, to that company itself.&#8221;</em>
                      </p>
                      
                      <p style="font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Verdana; min-height: 16px; margin: 0px;">
                        <p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Verdana;">
                          With or without such a disclaimer, GOOD&#8217;s readers are impacted by the advertisers that appear in their pages.

                            One person who gets this is Vicki Bell, founder and editor of <a href="http://www.littlepaper.com/"><span style="color: #002bee; text-decoration: underline;">The Little Paper</span></a>, a local Toronto guide for young families. The paper&#8217;s tagline says it all: &#8220;Proudly urban, totally independent, fiercely smart & a little bit silly.&#8221; The Little Paper is an absolutely essential publication for parents because it lists virtually every activity happening in Toronto. And, it has very healthy circulation of <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">10,000 families a month</span>. Several of the &#8220;usual suspect&#8221; parent magazine advertisers like <a href="http://www.nestle.com">Nestle</a>, <a href="http://www.jnj.com/connect/">Johnson + Johnson</a> and <a href="http://www.babyeinstein.com/home/">Baby Einstein</a> would purchase advertising if approached by The Little Paper. But that&#8217;s not how The Little Paper rolls.
                          </p>
                          
                          <p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Verdana;">
                            <p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Verdana;">
                              Instead you&#8217;ll find small ads from a bunch of local kids&#8217; programs, clothing stores and the like. The result? A magazine that lives up to it&#8217;s claim to be &#8220;fiercely independent.&#8221; Vicki calls it &#8220;Enlightened self interest.&#8221; In her words &#8220;as long as independents support the Little Paper, the Little Paper puts them first.&#8221;
                            </p>
                            
                            <p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Verdana; min-height: 16.0px;">

                                Similarly, if you, like GOOD, claim to represent people who &#8220;give a damn&#8221; than they should keep better company than Ralph Lauren. He&#8217;s just not your type. It may require a different business model, but you&#8217;re only as good as the company you keep.
