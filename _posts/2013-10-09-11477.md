On October 20th, the[ Hypenotic Loves PARC ][1]team will lace up our sneakers, and walk 5K with our friends at [Parkdale Activity and Recreation Centre (PARC).][2] PARC is right down the road from our offices and we had the privilege of sitting in on their weekly knitting groups, hockey shinnies and jam sessions when we did research and strategy for them last year.

5k is not a marathon by any stretch.  But what we came to understand was the journey experienced by a PARC member and how this experience shapes what PARC means to their lives.

This was best summed up by PARC staff member Louis who wrote the following about his walk last year:

> While I could not even begin to describe the hardships I have witnessed over the past two decades, what has made the most vivid impression on me is the experience I have had of the almost limitless capacity of the human spirit to endure in the face of incredible, and often incredibly unfair, obstacles.
> 
> Our community often seems to somehow find ways to rise above the wounds of its individual members, as well as the ongoing and profound challenges stemming from poverty, homelessness, disabilities, abuse, trauma, mental health issues and loneliness in order to create this living tissue we call PARC. The web thus woven a little more each day in turn promotes in everyone a shared feeling of safety, purpose and connectedness.

PARC not only helps transform marginalized individuals into members of a community, but they are literally shaping the future of Parkdale by working hard to ensure that Parkdale&#8217;s gentrification doesn&#8217;t leave it&#8217;s past and neighbours behind.

So, 5k it is. We hope you&#8217;ll support us in our walk by [making a donation to the Hypenotic Loves PARC team. ][1]

Say it with me now&#8230;Hypenotic Loves PARC!
