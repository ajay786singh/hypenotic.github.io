New Orleans vodka tastes like mango and black pepper, LA tastes like blueberry, acai berry, acerola cherry and pomegranate.

It&#8217;s a smart move for Absolut.

Every vodka brand has mimicked the flavours that Absolut was initially known for. So now [Grey Goose][2] comes in L&#8217;Orange, [Smirnoff][3] Blueberry tastes, you guessed it, like Blueberry and on and on.

Unless you&#8217;re a connoisseur, Vodka is a parity product, and brands are looking for ways to stand apart.

In his book [Zag][4], Marty Neumeier focuses on outlining a strategy to ensure your brand is *not *doing what the other guy is doing.  This is because, in Neumeier&#8217;s words

> Fighting clutter with more clutter is like trying to put out a fire with gasoline.

The key to zagging, according to Neumeier is looking for new market space, or &#8220;white space&#8221; that you brand can claim, and credibly own.

So, Absolute zagged, and they did it right by leveraging the power of meaningful marketing.

In a [previous blog post, I criticized Febreeze ][5]for coming up with air fresheners that were supposed to smell like places like &#8220;Moroccan Bazzar.&#8221; But Absolut has approached the &#8216;places&#8217; idea in a far more intelligent way.

Each city themed vodka has a portion of proceeds going to a worthy cause that is directly embedded within the city featured on the bottle. So, the New Orleans vodka has proceeds directed at Hurricane Katrina relief, and the Brooklyn vodka supports Habitat for Humanity to help fund an affordable homes project in Bedford-Stuyvesant.

It is interesting to note that there is some controversy surrounding Absolut Brooklyn that threatens its intrinsic values- proposition. Director [Spike Lee][6], collaborated with Absolut on the creative execution of the bottle and ad. The video celebrating Brooklyn&#8217;s stoops is undeniably hip and fun



But one big problem; the Brooklyn Neighbourhood featured in the video, ads and on the bottle has a number of social issues, one of which includes alcoholism. And, in  troubled neighbourhood where people are inundated with alcohol advertising, the Absolut Brooklyn ads are the most prominent.

[The New York Daily News ][7]featured a number of teenagers who did a survey of alcohol advertising posters and billboards in their neighbourhood and they had some choice words for Spike Lee. When asked what he&#8217;d like to tell Spike Lee, one teenager commented:

> &#8220;I&#8217;d be like, &#8216;Why? Do you understand what you&#8217;re doing &#8230; that you&#8217;re putting up an ad for liquor and you know there&#8217;s an alcoholism problem here?&#8217;

This controversy brings the challenges of values-based marketing into sharp relief. The moment you try to claim any kind of values space, you&#8217;re suddenly vulnerable to criticism. I&#8217;ve used this example before but it&#8217;s a good one; claim you&#8217;re a vegetarian and suddenly everyone&#8217;s checking out your belt and footwear to call you out on your hypocricy.

As a director committed to films profiling African Americans, Spike Lee&#8217;s involvement raises the &#8220;values&#8221; bar. The criticism of young people from Bedford-Stuyvesant probably should have been anticipated by the agency behind Absolut. But something tells me it likely didn&#8217;t cross their minds.

So, should Absolut have stayed out of the controversy and veered to a different city? Or, is this a suitable homage to Brooklyn? Are people overreacting? After all, is Brooklyn really the market for Absolut Brooklyn, or is it the rest of us who romanticize about the stoop life that Lee portrays?

Curious what you think.
