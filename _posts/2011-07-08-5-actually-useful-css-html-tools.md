You have to admit that reading &#8220;Lorem Ipsum&#8221; over and over gets boring. Fillerati solves that problem by selecting random passages from literary classics like Carroll&#8217;s  *Alice in Wonderland*. This tool even takes it a step further by even generating HTML tags to go with it like lists, headings, and paragraphs.

&#8220;[...] text set in EMs scale to the body font-size. Only one element’s font-size needs to change instead of individually changing the font-size of each element. [...] Accessibility is increased for end-users because text is scaled based on their preferences rather than set statically in pixels.&#8221; Keeping track of EMs can be a difficult task since it can vary depending on the body font size you choose. Thankfully PXtoEM provides handy conversion tables and converters to keep you from getting a headache.
