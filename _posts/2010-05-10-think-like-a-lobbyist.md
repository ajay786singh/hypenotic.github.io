This week,[ Mark Bittman Tweeted][1] a link from the [Beyond Green ][2]blog where the author quotes an NPR interview with the Vice President of the American Beverage Association. In the interview, the Big Soda representative attempts to make soda seem necessary for kids based on its hydrating properties:

> 
&#8220;..Children who have been exercising may not drink enough water to get back to the hydration point that they need to be at.  So with a little bit of flavoring and a little bit of sweetness, they will drink enough then to get back to where they need to be.&#8221;

The blogger of course responds that the lobby groups wants &#8220;to make sure we realize that soda is positively healthy because it&#8217;s 99% water, and water is an important nutrient. &#8221;

I&#8217;ve been thinking about this argument, and have come up with a few of my own that could be used by other lobby/interest groups to bolster their agendas:

*   [Forces Canada][3], the pro-choice smoking organization: Smoking is good for you, because it helps you step back from your troubles and reduces stress
*   Catholic Church: Unprotected sex is healthy because it reduces environmental waste (no condom disposal)
*   [Active Healthy Kids Canada][4]: Bullying is healthy, it promotes exercise (running away from the horrible kid perp)

Help me out folks. Got any to add to the list?
