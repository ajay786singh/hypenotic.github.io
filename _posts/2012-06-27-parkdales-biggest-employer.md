Who is Parkdale&#8217;s biggest employer? A hot startup web company? A state of the art recording studio? An industrial design firm? You might be surprised to find out that [PARC][1] (Parkdale Activity Recreation Centre) located at the foot of Queen West and Dowling is likely Parkdale&#8217;s biggest employer.

PARC is among a strip of social service organizations just before you embark on the Queensway. You know the one right?  Well, as part of [Hypenotic&#8217;s journey to better connect and serve our Parkdale community][2] I walked through the doors I&#8217;d passed by many times and was introduced to a place that still has me reeling with excitement.

<a href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/9434/parkdales-biggest-employer/attachment/screen-shot-2012-06-27-at-10-00-46-am" rel="attachment wp-att-9435"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9435" title="Screen shot 2012-06-27 at 10.00.46 AM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-shot-2012-06-27-at-10.00.46-AM.png" alt="" width="398" height="294" /></a>

Inside PARC&#8217;s doors I found a number of folks facing issues of  poverty, mental health, addictions, homelessness and food security issues all working to rebuild their lives. But I also found Parkdale&#8217;s biggest employer. Consider the following:

*   120: The number of PARC members (their clients) who also work running the daily operations
*   39: The number of people employed by PARC&#8217;s [Edmund Place][3], a supportive housing complex. This number includes all the 34 tenants, plus 3 housekeeping member employees, 2 tenant/cooks

These numbers don&#8217;t include folks working at [The Silver Brush][4] a social enterprise PARC started which employs PARC members to undertake interior painting services in the community.

  In addition to its role as an employer, PARC is also one of Parkdale&#8217;s biggest, and best landlords. As Parkdale&#8217;s gentrification takes hold and more and more restaurants and local businesses change the face of Queen West, rents have skyrocketed. When PARC&#8217;s renovation was completed, they had the opportunity to seek out desirable tenants for desirable storefront real estate.Did they get Second Cup? Sleep Country? Rexall? Nope.

  Parc became a landlord, offering reasonable rent options to other non-profits serving the community including <a href="http://www.stchrishouse.org/st-chris/index.php">St. Chistopher House</a>, <a href="http://www.crct.org/">Community Resource Connections</a>, and <a href="http://creatingtogetherparkdalefrp.com/">Creating Together Family Resource Centre </a>all on street level.

  My visit to PARC highlighted the degree to which PARC plays a critical part in building the generative economy. In a recent <a href="http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/9-strategies-to-end-corporate-rule/can-there-be-201cgood201d-corporations">YES Magazine</a> article on the subject, Marjorie Kelly (who we met at the <a href="http://www.livingeconomies.org/conference-2012/">BALLE Conference</a>) puts it this way:
</div>

> <div>
>   This revolution is about broadening economic power from the few to the many and redefining the purpose of economic activity. The aim isn’t to endlessly grow gross domestic product or to create wealth for a financial elite, but to generate the conditions for the flourishing of life.
> </div>

<div>
  PARC is playing a critical role in building a new economy where wealth is shared, so much so that when Mike Harris cut taxes to wealthier folks on the backs of the poorest among us, PARC&#8217;s staff donated their tax cuts back to PARC, creating a fund that still exists today.
</div>

<div>
   
</div>

<div>
  We&#8217;re getting to know our neighbours better. And as we walk down Queen Street we&#8217;re learning that the new economy isn&#8217;t that new after all. It&#8217;s been alive and well in Parkdale for a long time thanks to organizations like PARC.
