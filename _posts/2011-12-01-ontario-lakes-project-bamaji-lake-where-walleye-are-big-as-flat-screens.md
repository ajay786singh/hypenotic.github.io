If you&#8217;ve got a thing for Walleye, then Bamaji Lake in Sioux Lookout is where you want to be. Swimming in those waters are trophy walleye, measuring up to 32&#8243;&#8211;People, 32&#8243; is the size of a a good sized flat screen TV. That&#8217;s some fish.

Surprisingly, the name &#8216;walleye&#8217; has nothing to do with the positioning of the fishes&#8217; eyes (even though the [urban dictionary][1] uses it that way.) The name actually comes from the fact that, like lions, walleye&#8217;s eyes reflect white light. This means they have a layer of pigment around their eyes which make them extra sensitive.

And if you want to catch a walleye as big as a big ol&#8217; flatscreen TV, here&#8217;s (according to [Walleye Central][2]) what you need to do:

*   Because of their sensitivity to light, walleye bite best at dusk or at night
*   Fall is the best time to catch walleye because they move more slowly
*   Use the lightest jig possible, yet one that is heavy enough to maintain contact with the bottom
*   Big minnows and big baits work best for bigger fall walleye

If you&#8217;re looking for a place to stay, Bamaji&#8217;s fishing resort [Knobby&#8217;s Fly In Fishing Camp][3] is hands-down the place to be. In fact, as they say on their website &#8220;If you haven&#8217;t fished Knobby&#8217;s you haven&#8217;t fished!&#8221;
