Let&#8217;s get straight to this, &#8217;cause this is some funny stuff. Two small caveats:

1.  This is NSFW (put on those headphones)
2.  This is not safe for people without a sense of humour



Location services like [Foursquare][1], [Gowalla][2], [Yelp][2] and most recently [Facebook Places][3] give you the ability to sign-in at locations like restaurants, bars, grocery stores, and share your location and tips with friends.

It raises the question of whether any place is a good place to check in.

Not long ago, I noticed a woman checking in on Foursquare at a place called [Discount Cigarettes][4] in Pesacola Florida. Why would you want to brag about hanging at a place like that? [Others have suggested ][5]that places like &#8220;happy ending&#8221; massage parlours and pawn shops may not be the kind of places you want to tell your network you&#8217;re hanging out at.

Should you sign in at Church and Synagogue? [People ][6]are starting to consider these questions.

What do you think? Are there places that should be off bounds for &#8216;check-ins&#8217;?
