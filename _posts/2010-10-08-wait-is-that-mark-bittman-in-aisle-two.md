<span style="color: #444444;">This</span>][1] image from the online version of [Macleans Magazine&#8217;s visit to Fiesta Farms][1] with celebrity chef, writer and sustainable food advocate Mark Bittman says more about the local food movement&#8217;s progress than the print edition.

<span style="color: #444444;"><a href="http://www2.macleans.ca/2010/10/08/wait-is-that-mark-bittman/">The &#8220;LFP&#8221; and &#8220;BUY THIS TO VOTE&#8221; signs you see in front of Mark </a>indocate</span> where you can find Ontario produce that&#8217;s been certified &#8220;local sustainable&#8221; by [Local Food Plus][2].

The Certification indicates that the producer has jumped through serious hoops to deliver food that wouldn&#8217;t make you sick if you knew where it came from, what&#8217;s in it, how it was made, how the people who made it are treated, how the animals were treated before volunteering to be dinner and what it took to get it here.

The [Buy This to Vote][3] Campaign helps consumers make the connection between their purchasing choices and what&#8217;s on offer at the grocery store, restaurants and in institutions. We made that! It&#8217;ll be rolling out over the next year.

I can&#8217;t wait until they see the other side of the aisle. When Macleans and Mark Bittman catch wind of programs like this that represent how amazingly food forward Ontario&#8217;s non-profits and sustainable brands are, we&#8217;re in for a meaty story.
