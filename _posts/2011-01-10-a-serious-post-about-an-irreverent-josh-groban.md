[Josh Groban][1] is a tenor vocalist. The folks on his [fan site][2] call him a &#8220;classical crossover tenor vocalist.&#8221; In marketing-speak *Crossover* is a funny word. I associate it with &#8220;Crossover SUVs&#8221; that are really SUV&#8217;s without the guilt. Is that what&#8217;s going on here? Is Josh Groban just [André Bocelli][3] or worse, [Il Divo][4], in hipster clothing? Or does Crossover mean something more?

Last week, when Josh Groban sang [Kayne West tweets][5] on [Jimmy Kimmel][6] Live, he changed the game. Well, he&#8217;s been making a name for himself for a while. Remember when he was [&#8220;caught&#8221; in line for Snoop Dogg&#8217;s pot brownies ][7]on the AMA&#8217;s? Or when [he sang the praises of Jimmy F(&king Ben Affleck][8]?



Brands were traditionally thought of as having  a consistent set of personality traits. Banks, insurance companies, scotch, Mercedes would all be considered to have &#8220;serious&#8221; brand attributes, and any divergence from this into the realm of silly or irreverent would considered be damaging to the brand. Tenors would also be considered to have &#8220;serious&#8221; brand personalities.

It&#8217;s interesting to see this old brand thinking to be challenged through Groban&#8217;s antics.

The idea of brand personality is changing, and with it the whole notion of who your communities of interest are. Brands, celebrities, businesses are no longer static entities. Imagine if your &#8220;serious&#8221; friend was always serious. Serious at a party. Serious during sex. Serious at the park with his kids. And more and more brands are functioning like people. They are multi-dimensional, and people are cool with that.

By extension, communities of interest aren&#8217;t static either. So, you might think that only a certain type of person would like a tenor vocalist like Groban. And maybe that person would look like my mom. But, it turns out, that&#8217;s not the whole story. In a recent Billboard magazine interview, Groban said:

> &#8220;It&#8217;s easy to generalize,&#8221; he says. &#8220;But I&#8217;d love to take people through my concert audience and point out all the different types of people who are there. I think at the start of my career my audience was older and more female, and that image has stuck around for the rest of the time. But what I think happened is these women brought their husbands and their sons and their daughters, and everybody had a great time, and now it runs the gamut.&#8221;

Check out the comments about Groban&#8217;s take on Kayne on the notably lewd [website D-Listed][9], where in addition to the usual disses, people make comments like:

> Josh Groban is so fucking cute. His awesome levels just shot up like 50 more points for me.

Maybe &#8220;awesome levels&#8221; are the new cred. Being irreverent is one of those things that allows you to seem accessible, funny, interesting&#8230;&#8230;human. So you&#8217;re not just &#8220;the amazing voice,&#8221; you&#8217;re the* guy* with the amazing voice. That&#8217;s very different.

Back to the cocktail party scenario, there&#8217;s nothing more endearing than when a person surprises you. It happens to me all the time. I know someone as &#8220;edgy&#8221; and they turn out to be really sweet. Or, I think of someone as an intellectual, but I love them so much more when they make me howl with laughter at a party. Consistency is boring. Surprises are memorable.

So, how are you working to surprise people? How would exposing another side of yourself make you more accessible? Or, is accessibility sometimes a bad idea?
