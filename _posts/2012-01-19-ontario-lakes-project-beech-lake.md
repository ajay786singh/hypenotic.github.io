This post about Beech Lake and Sasquatch comes from a blog post on [The Centre for Fortean Zoology Canada&#8217;s website.][1] In case you&#8217;re wondering, Fortean Zoology occupies itself with the mysteries underlying species that have not yet been proven to exist.

I have included excerpts from the post, but you can find [the (much longer) post here. ][2]

**My name is Matthew, and I blame Minden, Ontario for my fear of Sasquatch.**

by Guest Blogger Matthew J. Didier, PSICAN

I became fascinated with Sasquatch because he smelled bad&#8230; and I have always had an odd fear of extremely bad smells&#8230; This said, I would not have thought about, considered, or even known about Sasquatch&#8217;s odour had it not been for a particularly bad&#8230;documentary that was once shown at the old Beaver Theatre.

My parents would often travel to the little island we owned on Beech Lake for entire summers&#8230; often leading to extremely bored kids, and a movie &#8220;in the big town&#8221; was often a cure for what is most properly called &#8220;cabin fever&#8221; in these cases.

I saw most of my first James Bond films at both The Beaver in Minden and the Molou in Haliburton Village&#8230; but&#8230;it was Bigfoot&#8217;s stink that held me.

I remember bothering my mother and father consistently&#8230; about sightings and evidence of Sasquatch in and around the Minden &#8211; Carnarvon &#8211; Haliburton corridor&#8230; although their re-assurance was little help for my insomnia.

My only relief that summer came from the ride back into the Sasquatch-Free land of the big city, with it&#8217;s constant noise and lights.

  I honestly don&#8217;t know why I feel that this entry is &#8220;worthy&#8221; of posting&#8230; perhaps to say that there&#8217;s a myriad of ways and times in one&#8217;s life that an interest in the paranormal comes to them&#8230; and that not all of us &#8220;outgrow&#8221; it because we &#8220;know better.&#8221;
