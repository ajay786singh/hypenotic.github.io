I discovered TheHydeTube, an online short film fest brought to us by Mr. Hyde, a Parisian production company. There&#8217;s some amazing work on here, and my 6 year old son and I fell in love with [this particular piece][1]. I was pleasantly surprised at the ending, as not enough companies have this much imagination.

check out [TheHydeTube][2] for more work.
