This is a beautiful, informative and compelling four minute run down on the consequences of our industrial approach to fishing. As you might imagine, it&#8217;s unsustainable in the starkest meaning of the term–it can&#8217;t last. If you knew you were going to running out of something you wanted/needed, wouldn&#8217;t you ration it?

I know we&#8217;re all busy picking back up after a hectic summer, but the organizations who are profitting by destroying eco-systems, livelihoods and and cultural diets are depending on that. If nothing else, the following entertaining  video is an easy way to familiarize yourself with the details. Like [School House Rock][1] said–&#8221;Knowledge is power!&#8221;



The campaign is also a special kind of call to action. It reminds us of the role cititizens play in the system–not only as consumers, which is important but limiting–but also as policy influencers.

Today is the last day of &#8220;European Fish Weeks 2012&#8243;, a campaign by a coalition of 160+ member organizations whose mission is:

> &#8220;To ensure that the 2012 reform of the EU Common Fisheries Policy stops overfishing, ends destructive fishing practices and delivers fair and equitable use of healthy fish stocks.  
> Our broad alliance of organisations employs scientific evidence and extensive experience in engaging decision-makers and stakeholders at all levels.&#8221;

You can get a brief run down of the initiative from [Slow Food International][2], one of the 5 international member organizations or you can head directly to the [Ocean 2012 campaign home][3] to find out more about the issue and solutions.
