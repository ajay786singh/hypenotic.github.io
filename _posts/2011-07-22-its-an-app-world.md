My [last post][1] about the joy of being a [hybrid web designer/developer][1] left a crucial component out of the equation. Apps. Yes, the world is turning into small pieces of specialized software that do one thing and, hopefully, one thing very well. It could be a game, some sort of productivity app for your iphone, a lifestyle app for your android phone, or something entirely different for that tablet resting in your hand. Whatever it is, to be a web designer and/or developer, having participated in the creation of an app will get you to that next level.

There are numerous stats out there but whatever the number, apps are increasingly becoming your connection to the rest of the world.Â  Mashable says it best with this:
