I love to cook. It&#8217;s not something that comes to me naturally, or that I have a real aptitude for, but it&#8217;s for these reasons that I find cooking to be such a rich, challenging, and engaging sensory experience. There&#8217;s nothing more rewarding than being able to eat the fruits of your labour- literally.

Despite lacking natural ability in the kitchen,  I do have an innate understanding of one thing- visual communication. I&#8217;m a designer and illustrator by trade, but more importantly I&#8217;m a visual learner. If you were to present me with a list of ingredients and instructions, but with absolutely no visual aid, I&#8217;d be less likely to understand, process, and therefore produce your delicious recipe. It&#8217;s nothing personal- I&#8217;m sure your Aunt&#8217;s casserole is divine, this is just something hardwired into my biology.

Now, give me information presented in conjunction with pictures, charts, diagrams, and some solid design and I&#8217;ll be enthralled. Take the minimalist photography of culinary grad, [William Matthew Valle][1], or the sequential photographs and clear instructions in Jane Horby&#8217;s book, *[What to Cook and How to Cook it][2], *and IKEA&#8217;s *[Homemade is Best][3]*.  They&#8217;re all good on the eyes, while still appealing to the stomach.
