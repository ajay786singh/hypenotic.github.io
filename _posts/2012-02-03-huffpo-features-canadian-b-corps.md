Huffington Post Canada wrote a great article about Canadian B Corps which features great Canadian companies like [Ian Martin Group][1], [Ethical Bean Coffee.][2]

The owner of Vancouver Investment Fund [Renewal 2][3] put it best by saying:

> B Corp certifications add a layer of confidence and are a signal of a level of commitment and values by an entrepreneur or company

<p style="text-align: left;">
  We&#8217;re loving our B Corp status and the cred it brings. If you&#8217;re interested in becoming B Corp just ask us and we&#8217;ll tell you why we&#8217;re so keen on it.
