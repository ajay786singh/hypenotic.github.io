When I started my internship at Hypenotic last week, the first assignment that I was given was to write a blog post about myself. Now, I know what you’re thinking- why did this take her a week to complete? What is this girl doing? But for me, this small task was intimidating. I’m an Illustration student; I have no desire to be limited by my background in, well, exclusively visual communication, but writing is something those of us in my program so often forget about during long fevered nights of making images, and drinking obscene amounts of coffee.

So naturally, when Barry suggested creating an infographic about myself, I jumped on the opportunity. In this way, I would be able to introduce myself using my skill set, but also be challenged to generate written content. The resulting image is what you see now- click to enlarge, and enjoy!
