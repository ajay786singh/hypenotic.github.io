  Today <a href="http://www.foodshare.net/school-crunch.htm">FoodShare </a>is having it&#8217;s ‘Great Big Crunch’ event where students and teachers are invited to learn about healthy eating and local and global food systems.
</p>

Those of us who support good food and the work of organizations like Foodshare were invited to crunch along with school kids and teachers and snap photos of ourselves digging in.

Here are the folks at Hypenotic striking a pose and doing our part for a healthy food system, the environment,  our health, our local economy and for our bellies.
