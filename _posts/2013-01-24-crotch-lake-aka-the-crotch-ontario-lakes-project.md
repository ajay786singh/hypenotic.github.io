This has to be the best (or worst depending on your perspective) name for an Ontario Lake so far. Crotch Lake, 1.5 hours from Ottawa is often referred to as &#8220;The Crotch.&#8221;

Here are a few examples:

*   From a [fishing forum][1] &#8220;my family and I have been going up to &#8220;the Crotch&#8221; for several years now.&#8221;
*   From [a blog post][2] &#8220;we headed for The Crotch in May of 2010.&#8221;
*   [From a trip review on a kayak site][3] &#8220;We even debated leaving altogether, without giving the Crotch a chance.&#8221;

This final writer gives both the Lake, and its name a big &#8216;ol thumbs up. Here&#8217;s why:

> In hindsight our trip members were very grateful that Crotch Lake was last in line when lake names were being handed out. If it held the name &#8220;500 Island lake&#8221;, or, &#8220;Towering pine lake &#8212; &#8220;Over granite shoreline&#8221; or &#8220;Large pristine lake without cottages&#8221; all of which are true, then it would be over run. We even debated leaving altogether, without giving the Crotch a chance. The spirits of the lake had surely done all they could to discourage another visitor. After some friendly debate, we pressed on, curious. What we found was paradise.

Turns out the name Crotch Lake is a blessing for the Lake and those who visit. In short, it keeps the crotch sniffers away.
