While myself, Eamonn and Marc are always very focused on shooting, as soon as the smell of saffron and onions started wafting through the kitchen, we were ready to eat.

Zahra&#8217;s cooking was not only delicious but incredibly vibrant. The ingredients were chosen for their flavour and for the visual dimension they bring to the dish; green pistachios, bright orangy-yellow saffron, and bright red dried berries. When Zahra finished preparing her rice dish, I questioned whether I&#8217;d ever eat plain brown rice slopped in a bowl again. Her rice was a piece of art. And as she told us, each person adds their own flourishes to the dish to make it look just &#8216;so.&#8217;

In the blog, Meagan pairs her love of visual art with her love of cooking. And the results are mouth watering. Check out her [latest pairing][3]; a sensual painting of a mound of butter by Antoine Vollon and a recipe for parmesan mustard shortbread (Oh my god!).

Cooking with Zahra was also a lovely pairing; a warm and friendly home, and delicious beautiful food to match. Thanks Zahra.

Tomrrow, I meet my friend Arlene&#8217;s Oma Wanda. Stay tuned.
