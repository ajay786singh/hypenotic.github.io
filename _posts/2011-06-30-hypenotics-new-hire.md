I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard the theory that [people hire people who are like themselves.][1]

Of course this can have all kinds of negative consequences&#8211;glass ceiling, racism, &#8220;Old Boys Club&#8221; kind of issues.

But in our case it&#8217;s resulted in an incredibly serendipitous event. We hired someone who looks just like Barry&#8211;except she&#8217;s female, younger, harrier and comes from Mexico, not Montreal.

Check out this picture of [Barry ][2]and our new Senior art director [Angélica Ramos][3] and tell me&#8211;does she not look just like Barry (but of course in a female kind of way)?

As my Yiddish grandmother would say, they&#8217;re both [Shayna Punim][5]&#8211;such pretty faces.
