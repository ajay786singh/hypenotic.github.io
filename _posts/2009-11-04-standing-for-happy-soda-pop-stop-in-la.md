Awesome Video of John Nese, owner of Soda Pop Stop in LA. Best part is when he says &#8220;It&#8217;s rally bubbled water. If I was to define it in one word it would be happy&#8230;maybe smile.&#8221; He gets marketing and he&#8217;s completely authentic. He confidently says that the key is to &#8220;set yourself apart by providing your customers with something that no one else has.&#8221;

He&#8217;s got an opinion AND a spine. He rants on everything from Corn Syrup, Energy Drinks and Big Business. That&#8217;s what really sets him apart.
