Most arts organizations grossly underutilize the power of multimedia to add a whole new dimension to their art form (with funding being what it is, most arts organizations have pitiful websites, never mind multimedia.) But, multimedia has the power to add layers of meaning and understanding to the performing arts and, in turn, get &#8216;bums in seats.&#8217;

It is common knowledge that younger folks lack interest in symphony. The San Francisco Symphony&#8217;s [Keeping Score][1] initiative is tackling this issue. With dedicated websites on compositions by Beethoven, Stravinsky and Copeland they make the most of the media by offering fun, interactive opportunities. 

Try your hand at being a conductor for Stravinsky&#8217;s Right of Spring. Practice modulation like Beethoven did. The deeper you dig the more you find. It&#8217;s rather addictive. And, the web is integrated into a program that includes TV, radio, classroom workshops. 

It&#8217;s a lesson how to keep the arts relevant to audiences who may not pick up a haughty brochure or read symphony reviews in the paper. It&#8217;s not just about adding a facebook link or making concerts available on youtube. It&#8217;s about making the medium work for your intended audience.
