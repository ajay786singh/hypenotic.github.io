According to the[ World Records Academy ][1], Lake Bernard is the world&#8217;s largest fresh water lake without any islands in it. Kind of a neat statistic don&#8217;t cha think? Especially when you consider how many islands populate the lakes surrounding Lake Bernard throughout the Muscoka region.

What&#8217;s even cooler is that many believe that Lake Bernard is so unique because it was created by an ancient meteor strike. That&#8217;s right, a large piece of debris from our solar system hit the earth and made this lake where people now sit in Adirondack chairs, wearing flip flops and and sipping bloody Ceasars all summer long.
