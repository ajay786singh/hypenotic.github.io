At Hypenotic we often talk about making sure what you create is useful and relevant. This boils down to the fact that it solves a problem for somebody and addresses their pain points.

Need a brilliant example? Enter [Fruitwash stickers][1]. This is so genius I can hardly stand it. Those stickers are a necessity for the checkout process, but oh-so annoying to the customer. I&#8217;ll admit, I&#8217;ve eaten my share of stickers only to discover the mishap later.

By contrast Fruitwash stickers dissolve into organic soap to remove pesticides from fruit and vegetables.

If you&#8217;re looking for inspiration about how to create meaningful marketing look no further then inventor Scott Amron who says.

> &#8220;I&#8217;ve always been discontent with fruit labels and felt they could do more than just display product info and be difficult to peel off,&#8221; Amron <a href="http://www.gizmag.com/dissolving-food-stickers-wash-fruit/20392/?utm_source=Gizmag+Subscribers&utm_campaign=6039729856-UA-2235360-4&utm_medium=email" target="_self">told</a> Gizmag. &#8220;We buy, wash and eat fruit. So, the wash step was the next thing the label should help with.&#8221;

How could you turn your &#8216;must have&#8217; communications into something that will:

*   Meaningfully engage people
*   Help them do what they need to do anyway
*   Make sure a touch point takes away customer&#8217;s pain points?
