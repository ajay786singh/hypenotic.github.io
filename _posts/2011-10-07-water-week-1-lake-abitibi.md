The name Abitibi is an Algonquin word meaning &#8220;middle waters&#8221; (*abitah* ‘middle’ and *nipi* ‘water&#8217;) because the lake is situated between Hudson&#8217;s Bay and the Ottawa River&#8211;the midway point for canoes travelling between these two key points.

Today Canadian wild sturgeon caught in Lake Abitibi are the source of Canada&#8217;s best, sustainable alternative to caspian caviar.

Here&#8217;s a video [of a very determined and chilly fellow][1] ice fishing and catching pike in Lake Abitibi (jump to 2:13 to witness the big catch)
