We need it, we get too much of it, check it way to often and use it as a very inefficient filing system most of the time.

Although it&#8217;s been around in various forms for decades, 1978 marks the year that the first email system was created at <a href="http://theemaillab.org/history-of-email.asp" target="_blank">UMDMJ</a> in Newark, NJ.

Despite it&#8217;s various incarnations, it hasn&#8217;t really changed much since then. You can argue that Hotmail, Gmail and Yahoo! Mail and whatever tried, they really just put new paint on an old car.

Until now.

There seems to be a renewed interest in email and how we manage it with <a href="http://www.mailboxapp.com/" target="_blank">Mailbox</a> and <a href="http://evomail.io/" target="_blank">Evomail</a> leading the charge. Both are mobile apps and they both claim that they want to change the way we interact and think about email. It&#8217;s about time, but not surprising given the fact that mobile email viewing and surfing is skyrocketing.

Just a couple of weeks ago <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/solutions/collateral/ns341/ns525/ns537/ns705/ns827/white_paper_c11-520862.html" target="_blank">Cisco&#8217;s global mobile traffic forecast</a> for 2013 &#8211; 2017 stated that,

> By the end of 2013, the number of mobile-connected devices will exceed the number of people on earth, and by 2017 there will be nearly 1.4 mobile devices per capita. There will be over 10 billion mobile-connected devices in 2017, including machine-to-machine (M2M) modules-exceeding the world&#8217;s population at that time (7.6 billion).

Now, I&#8217;m still waiting to play around with either of these new email clients. Evomail is going to be released sometime early 2013 and I am in the world&#8217;s longest queue to get my hands on Mailbox.

When I signed up for Mailbox I had close to 600,ooo people in front of me. A week later, I&#8217;ve still got 383,567 people ahead of me and  432,529 people behind me. They&#8217;re doing this in order to safely scale up without any problems, but it also highlights the fact that there really is a thirst for better email management. People are tired of email controlling them. They want to be in charge and it seems that&#8217;s the way that Mailbox is being designed.



The big guns better be taking notes. They&#8217;ve got me hooked&#8230;now if only the lineup would hurry up already.
