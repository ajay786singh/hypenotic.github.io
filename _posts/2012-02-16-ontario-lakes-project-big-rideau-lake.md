&#8220;Clear a Lake and They Will Come.&#8221; Rick Mercer had it right.

Big Rideau Lake is home to Skate the Lake, an annual speed skating marathon on a 1k outdoor oval rink in Portland Ontario. Skaters from around the world take part in the 25 km, 50 km, and various other races. It&#8217;s also home to a curling competition.

The event is so quintessentially Canadian that it&#8217;s even been covered by Rick Mercer on the Rick Mercer Report. Watch Rick hitch himself to a Zamboni to get to the finish line.
