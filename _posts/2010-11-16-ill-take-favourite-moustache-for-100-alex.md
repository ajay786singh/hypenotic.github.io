They sum it up best when they call themselves &#8220;a multi-faceted place of business and leisure.&#8221;

Baitshop co-owners Ken and Greg jumped on the opportunity to join forces with Hypenotic and [Mildred&#8217;s Temple Kitchen][2] to throw and awesome Movember party in support of [Prostate Cancer Canada. ][3]

In this video, The Baitshop boys talk about why they&#8217;re getting behind Movember and celebrating The Great Canadian Moustache at Mildred&#8217;s Temple Kitchen. They&#8217;ll be at the party displaying artworks featuring our favourite Moustached Canadians and screening t-shirts with the images on site&#8211;all available to you.
