Arrowhead lake near lake Muskoka got its name from the aquatic plant that grows in its shallows. The Arrowhead plant (Sagittaria latifolia) also known as the &#8220;indian potato.&#8221; Â This tuber was common in the native Canadian diet. In 1890 parts of Portland were said to provide at least 31,000 people with 20 per cent of the calories they needed for the year. An inexperienced person could harvest an estimated 350 tubers (about six pounds) in an hour. That&#8217;s pretty impressive

Apparently, the best way to harvest the aquatic tubers is to dig through the shallow water with your toes until the roots come floating to the top. This is how native women typically foraged for them in frigid waters in fall and winter&#8211;when they&#8217;re in harvest.

Check out &#8220;Wild Girl&#8221; Becky Learner who in 2009 lived off of food foraged around Portland for a week. Here she is foraging for Arrowhead roots&#8211;doing what she calls &#8220;a joyous dance&#8221; with some of her pals.



Wapatos were a major staple food of native Canadians and Americans.
