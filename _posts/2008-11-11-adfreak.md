Here&#8217;s a great ad that reminds you that zoo animals aren&#8217;t stuffed variety, or animated images, but real living breathing beings. 

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-313" title="hogle-large" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/hogle-large-346x500.jpg" alt="" width="346" height="500" />][1]

> Wonder what the carnivorous animals at the zoo are thinking of you when youre gawking at them? An ad for Salt Lake Citys Hogle Zoo via Richter7 of that city has the answer. See the full ad here. Itd probably be best not to aggravate the situation by using bacon dental floss as part of your oral-hygiene regimen before heading off to the zoo.
