We&#8217;re delighted to announce that Rick, and his lovely wife Heather, welcomed a new daughter Eva (pr. Eh-vah) into the world.  She is a whopping 10 pounds and was born in their home. If that doesn&#8217;t make your weekend, check out the pictures below of Rick and Eva, and Eva with her big sister Emmalyn.

Congrats Rick & Heather. Enjoy your beautiful bundle.
