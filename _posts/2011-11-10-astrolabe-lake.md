Astolabe Lake is where in 1867 a 14 year old Cobden, Ontario farmboy named Edward George Lee found Samuel de Champlain&#8217;s long lost [Astrolabe][1] presumably lost 254 years earlier.  At least that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been lead to believe.

The famed astrolabe is now in the [Canadian Museum of Civilization][2]&#8216;s permanent collection. It was acquired by The Department of Communications in 1989 from a New Yorker for $250,000. But poor Edward Lee never saw a cent of its value. Charles Overman, the captain of a local steamboat paid the boy 1 dollar, which Lee&#8217;s father kept all to himself.

Beyond the astrolabe&#8217;s monetary value, the veracity of the astrolabe&#8217;s origins is important to a lot of folks. The lake (previously named Green Lake) was renamed for the famous find and there&#8217;s a big &#8216;ol plaque commemorating the event.

Given all this, we seriously hope the fact-checkers knew what they were doing.

But, apparently, the facts surrounding the providence of the astrolabe are not clear cut. In fact, there&#8217;s good reason to believe that the object in question was never used by Mr. Champlain at all.

In a [detailed exploration of the matter][3], journalist and historian Douglas Hunter says:

> Wondering if Champlain employed the Cobden astrolabe on the Upper Ottawa is like wondering if Mike Weir could drain a twenty-foot putt with a sand wedge during the Master’s. It might be doable with an awful lot of practice and some luck, but why on earth would Weir not just use a putter?

In other words that particular astrolabe wouldn&#8217;t be the right instrument for Champlain to use to navigate his canoe to the new world. This leads Hunter to conclude:

>  Flesh-and-blood Champlain may not have dropped the Cobden astrolabe, but a historic Champlain, a creature of modern imagination, deftly picked it up.

Given all that he&#8217;s contributed to Canadian history&#8211;real and imagined&#8211;we think it&#8217;s only appropriate to pay homage to Edward George Lee, the young Cobden boy who found the astrolabe and who has been overshadowed by Champlain, who as far as we can tell, never even touched the thing.

Here&#8217;s a video produced by the Museum of Civilization about the Astrolabe when it was acquired in 1989
