Now that I sport my own ink, I am more aware of ink on others than I ever was, so when I come across something of this calibre, I have to share. I think the art can be appreciated whether you’ve got your own tattoo or not.

When tattoos and high photography come together, I’ve got my fix for the day. Julie Becker is the subject of this photo spread for Inked Magazine, and what’s interesting is that she’s not just the model, but a tattoo artist herself.

Check out this amazing spread [here][1] [I would love to know 1. who the photographer was, and 2. who does her ink].

Check out Becker’s work [here.][2]

Enjoy!
