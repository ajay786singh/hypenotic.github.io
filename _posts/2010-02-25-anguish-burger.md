<img class="size-full wp-image-2062 alignright" title="Screen shot 2010-02-25 at 10.02.33 AM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Screen-shot-2010-02-25-at-10.02.33-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2010-02-25 at 10.02.33 AM" width="187" height="199" />I found myself *starving *at Home Depot yesterday. I begrudgingly stepped up and ordered a veggie burger from [Harveys][1]. I&#8217;m 1/2 way thorough the phenomenal book [Eating Animals][2], which, if you&#8217;ve read it you know&#8211;it leaves no choice *but* the veggie burger.

One of the main take-aways from [Jonathan Safran Foer&#8217;s ][3]investigation of where our meat comes from is the absolute meaninglessness of language when it comes to food. As Foer says about the term &#8220;free range:&#8221;

> Applied to meat, eggs, dairy and every now and then even fish&#8230;the free-range label is bullshit. It should provide no more peace of mind than &#8220;all natural,&#8221; &#8220;fresh,&#8221; or &#8220;magical.&#8221;

Standing in line listening to people order the Harvey&#8217;s Angus burger, and watching those grey looking pucks get plunked on the grill,  it was dead obvious. Whatever Angus means, it couldn&#8217;t mean much in the way of quality.  What does Angus mean in the context of factory farming? Well, it turns out it means absolutely nothing at all. As the blog [cheaphealthygood.com][4] says:

> Angus cattle are “the most popular beef breed of cattle in the U.S.” and fast food chains like Harvey&#8217;s aren&#8217;t &#8221; serving the high-quality Certified Angus Beef. It’s just regular ol’ Angus beef, which hasn’t been proven to taste any better.&#8221;

So, given the meaninglessness of fast food language, I&#8217;ve come up with a few terms of my own:

Hows about* Anus beef? *&#8220;I&#8217;ll have an anus burger please!&#8221;

Um, *Anguish beef?* &#8220;Two anguish burgers with cheese to go&#8221;

Or a combo-platter. Anus-guish burger &#8220;I&#8217;ll take the Anus-guish burger&#8221;

All good options, and frankly more meaningful, and truthful than the term Angus.
