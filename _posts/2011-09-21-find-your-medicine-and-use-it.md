One of my favourite Kathleen the crossing guard ([who we recently blogged about)][1] sent me an email with this music video in it. Like Kathleen, this song is about Â authenticity, happiness and how to live a good life.

It made my day so I&#8217;m sharing [Nahko and Medicine for the People][2] with you. Who couldn&#8217;t love a song with the lyric &#8220;There is no medicine on the television. So turn it off and turn yourself around.&#8221; Or, &#8220;Don&#8217;t waste your hate. Rather gather and create.&#8221; Wise words indeed.

And, in case you haven&#8217;t seen it yet, the little video we made about Kathleen (over 8000 views on Youtube) is also embedded here. Kathleen recently got a call from The Ellen Show (which [featured the video ][3]when we first shared it). We&#8217;ll keep you posted on whether Kathleen gets to meet Ellen. Hopefully she&#8217;ll take me along with her since I&#8217;m a pretty good dancer too.
