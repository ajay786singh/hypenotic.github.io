Want people to read your emails? You should consider where they&#8217;re reading it.

No, I don&#8217;t mean the washroom, the dinner table, or the boardroom when no one is looking.

Rather the mobile device that enables reading in these venues.

[Responsive web design][1]Â has become an important part of our toolkit at Hypenotic, because we want our clients to reach as wide an audience as possilbe.

A responsively designed website adapts to fit the device you&#8217;re using to view it. The layout and even the content are tweaked depending on whether you&#8217;re viewing a site on a desktop, a laptop, a tablet or mobile phone.

Responsive Design principals are now being applied to email to make them more readable on mobile devices.

According to this [infographic by Litmus][2] more of your audience is using their iPhone to read your newsletter than Outlook. And by a thin, but growing, margin more are using mobile devices than either their desktop or webmail.

If you want them to read it &#8212; heck love it &#8212; then you better think about how to make it a satisfying experience. That means thinking about how to provide interesting, relevant and useful content &#8212; that&#8217;s easy to consume.

If you&#8217;re reading this on your phone, you&#8217;ll notice this email isn&#8217;t exactly responsive. Call it the cobbler&#8217;s shoes. We&#8217;re working on it.

What do you think? How long will it be before you begin optimizing your outbound communications for mobile readers?
