My name is Tim Whittley and I&#8217;m a new web developer at Hypenotic. I&#8217;ve been working with Hypenotic part-time since the fall, but now I&#8217;m here full time which means I&#8217;m way past due for an introduction.

As a web developer I&#8217;m completely self taught. About six years ago I was rather bored with my job working in the back room at a recording studio. One of the studio owners noticed my penchant for all things computer related and suggested I learn web development. I set out with the humble goal of learning XHTML, CSS2, Javascript (straight up, no jQuery), and a bit of Flash. Before long I was pretty comfortable with all that and moved on to programming in PHP, developing WordPress themes and trying out some Ruby on Rails.

Jump ahead to 2013. The web development landscape has changed drastically for us developers. On the technical end of things HTML5, CSS3, and responsive design have evolved, and J<a title="The Plight of Pinocchio" href="https://speakerdeck.com/bkeepers/the-plight-of-pinocchio" target="_blank">avaScript is well on it&#8217;s way to being a real language</a>. New toys like Git, SASS, and Chrome&#8217;s developer tools give us a powerful new toolset. We&#8217;ve also learned to pay attention to user experience, content strategy, and so much more.

I&#8217;m happy to be here at Hypenotic where all this new and shiny technology, and the new ways of thinking about the web are embraced. Thanks to everyone at Hypenotic for having me. I&#8217;m looking forward to whatever comes next.
