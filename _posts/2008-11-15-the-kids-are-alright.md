I recently read Carl Honoré&#8217;s [Under Pressure: Rescuing Childhood from the Culture of Hyper-Parenting. ][1]This book signals the arrival of what I see as a new trend. For years, parents have been bombarded with toys and props designed to make our children, from infancy,  smarter and more stimulated. Prompted by the incredible success of [Baby Einstein][2], companies like [Fisher Price][3] jumped on the bandwagon, with sub-brands like &#8220;Play and Learn,&#8221; &#8220;Laugh and Learn.&#8221; The operative word always being *learn. *I see something new on the horizon, and it looks alot like something old.

This year&#8217;s [Parenting Magazines&#8217; Toy Trends 2008][4] lists Eco Toys as the #1 trend. The #5 trend is &#8220;Back to Basics&#8221; toys described as:

> &#8220;from straight-from-the-woodshop block sets by Tree Blocks (so natural, some still have bark), to Front Porch Classic&#8217;s wooden Classic Magic 8 Ball, wooden toys have simple, sturdy, just-like-I-used-to-have appeal.&#8221;

The [Baby Einstein backlash ][5]is nothing new (did anyone really think those movies made kids smarter???), research has long indicated that none of these brand promises result in brainier babies. What is new is a viable alternative. The slow food, green and local movements (not to mention lead-tainted toys from China)  have created a new zeitgeist that promises a new approach to kids&#8217; entertainment. And not a moment too soon.

A front runner in this trend is[ Oompa Toys][6]. With a tag-line reading: &#8220;No batteries. No blinking lights. No cartoon-themed toys. Period&#8221; they have a solid focus and clear, honest communications. Not to mention fantastic toys. They&#8217;ve just opened their first store in Wisconsin. If I&#8217;ve got this right, it&#8217;ll be the first of many.
