In what looks like an ultra cool boon to homeowners and power consumers everywhere, Google&#8217;s making a gadget to help us track our consumption with a view to making better decisions.

The two big ideas are that knowing the effect of each thing you power is the first step to making decisions about needs vs. wants. I&#8217;ve always wondered whether I should let my computer go to sleep or shut it down for the night.

The second big idea is that the aggregated information from participants gives everyone a more relevant benchmark. Finding out what people in my neighbourhood with similar needs, conditions and appliances are paying sounds like some much needed perspective.
