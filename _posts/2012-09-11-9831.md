Many cottage associations host annual regattas. But Chandos Lake&#8217;s Regatta (in the North Kawartha area) is *so so so* good [Cottage Life][1] highlighted theirs as *the* example of how to do it right.

Cottage Life quotes the chair of the Chandos Lake Regatta Committee saying:

> To see the kids&#8217; faces when they put on their medals–they&#8217;re so excited

I have to say, watching the video above, most of the &#8216;kids&#8217; I see are hottie 20-somethings bouncing around in potato sack races, but hey, it&#8217;s all good clean fun happening in Chandos Lake.

So with Chandos Lake&#8217;s Regatta as the shining example, here are their tips (abbreviated from Cottage Life) to making a Regatta truly rock:

1.  **Get the basics:** You&#8217;ll need water with access to parking and bathrooms, and a summer weekend
2.  **Get Silly.** Canoe races with pie plates are much more fun
3.  **Feed People: **Get some burgers n&#8217; dogs donated, and get a liquor permit to keep the crowds imbibed
4.  **Market it!: **We know about this stuff&#8211;flyers, newsletters and social media to get the word out
5.  **Deploy Volunteers: **You&#8217;ll need lots of people to make it happen

Since it is the shining-star of Regatta, here&#8217;s a short video featuring all the shenanigans that go down at the Chandos Lake Regatta.
