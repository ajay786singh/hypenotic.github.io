The motto of Social Media is &#8220;if you get it, share it&#8221;. So in the spirit of giving it away, let me spell out the secret to becoming an expert on the web&#8217;s most amazing tools, tactics, and platforms:

> RTFM (Read The Fucking Manual)

The web offers mind-blowing resources for [what&#8217;s new][1], [what&#8217;s next][2], [how it&#8217;s impacting business][3], [case studies][4] and [how-tos][5]. There are ratings for everything, even [ratings for the raters][6]. There are [great ways to filter][7] if it&#8217;s all too much.

If you&#8217;re in too much of a hurry to filter your own information, you can use the greatest answer machine since the Wizard of Oz. Just type your question into the white box and a team of San Franciscan hampsters with PHDs get on their bicycle powered filtering wheels and process all the news in the world into a prioritized list for you.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-2887" href="http://hypenotic.com/social-media-category/2885/online-guru-is-spelled-rtfm/attachment/screen-shot-2010-09-09-at-5-20-07-pm"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2887" title="Screen shot 2010-09-09 at 5.20.07 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Screen-shot-2010-09-09-at-5.20.07-PM-580x234.png" alt="" width="580" height="234" /></a>

If I could be accused of facetiousness, it would only be in that people are too busy and would rather pay for answers and leave this area of expertise to people like Hypenotic.

And we do hope that keeps happening, as we&#8217;re committed to staying on top of the ways people are being influenced by media.

My point was simply that in this hyper-fast era, reading the instructions can be just enough to put you in the lead.

The irony is that the best brands are going out of their way on a design, usability and documentation level to make it easy for people to address, interact with and get value from their products/services.

I&#8217;d say that if there&#8217;s single a difference between people who get ahead online and people who feel like they&#8217;re being left behind it&#8217;s intrepidness. The willingness to look around corners. Figure things out. Push buttons and see what happens.

The good news is that it&#8217;s a learned skill. I wasn&#8217;t the kind of kid who took apart toasters to see how they worked but it wasn&#8217;t hard to be inspired by the amazing things we can do with technology.
