<pre><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; white-space: normal;">Inspiration can be found anywhere. We’re always immersed in a designed environment and everything from a sign in the in the street, a magazine or a package of cookies becomes, both consciously and subconsciously, part of a visual archive in our brain. Same thing happens online, only there’s so much out there that sometimes it’s hard to find the good stuff. These are the top 5 websites I use to find creative inspiration.</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; white-space: normal;"> </span></pre>

FFFFound! is a web service that allows users to post and share their favorite images found on the web. One of the things I like the most about their website’s functionality is that once you select an image, you start getting recommendations for similar postings which eventually lead you to that magical image that inspires you. It also allows you to track everything back to its original source which can result in getting to all sorts of interesting blogs and websites that otherwise would be difficult to find. FFFFound is very refreshing when you’re stuck and when you want to know about current design trends.

Pinterest is a virtual pin board where you can categorize images of things you like and share them with other people. Even though its purpose is similar to FFFFound, Pinterest has a completely different interface and layout, which feels like a happy, and cozy place online. You can take a look at my favourite things [here][2].

Pentagram is one of the most famous design firms in the world featuring super-star graphic designers like Paula Scher and Michael Bierut. They have designed hundreds of identities you could recognize like the one for MoMa or Saks Fifth Avenue. Their website is efficient and beautiful and acts like a huge bookshelf where you can pick and choose what project you want to see in more detail.

</p>

Speaking about rock star designers, this website is by my personal hero and all-time favourite designer, Stefan Sagmeister. When I want to look at things differently and push creativity I often ask myself, what would Sagmeister do? This guy has designed album covers for the Rolling Stones, David Byrne and Lou Reed but you probably remember him for carving a poster for AIGA on his own torso (maybe that was a bit extreme). His website may not be the most functional but it conveys the concept of creative freedom and outside the box thinking.

<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>

AIGA stands for the American Institute of Graphic Arts, and they offer everything a designer could ever need, from job postings, interesting articles and projects, events and competitions and great sources of inspiration. Their website is just so good I don’t even know where to start… visually gorgeous, with a grid system that makes it structurally interesting and categorized up to date information. Just take a look at it yourself, you’ll see I’m not exaggerating.
