I suppose the best way to get to know someone is through their favorite things. My husband tried to do this when we met, and kept a list of things I said I liked for use at a later date. He soon noticed that the list was very long, and often favorite items contradicted eachother. Like the time I said my favorite breakfast was oatmeal. And the next day my favorite breakfast was pie. He would soon learn that every single thing has potential to my favorite, because I can be very interested in everything.

So here we go, some greatest hits from the list of favorites:

Robert Henri, author of the Art Spirit. (Also my favorite book/ writer/ guru)
