A close friend (who happens to be a Dr.) sent me an email this morning. I watched it because I care what he thinks. I&#8217;m sharing it because it offers an important marketing lesson.

It got me wondering what it takes to:

*   get people&#8217;s attention
*   get people to act (especially in habit changing situations)
*   get people to share important health messages



It&#8217;s well know that <a title="USA Today Article on why men don't go to the Dr." href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/medical/health/medical/menshealth/story/2011/03/Study-Half-of-men-dont-go-to-the-doctor/45453184/1" target="_blank">men don&#8217;t go to the Dr. </a>unless they&#8217;re pushed.

And men of about any age should enjoy the video, so the chances of it being seen and spread are up there.

Food for thought:

1.  What emails do you share to people who trust you?
2.  Can your communications compete with this?

Maybe the next time you consider what it will take to get a message out, you&#8217;ll make sure that the information is as important, and that the way you do it is equally noteworthy.
