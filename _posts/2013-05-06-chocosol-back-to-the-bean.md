So you thought chocolate was just a food? So did I, until I met Michael Sacco of [ChocoSol][2]. Entering the world of ChocoSol was a bit like meeting the family Von Trapp, but replace music with chocolate. The community at ChocoSol is like a family whose ethics, work, and passions all culminate in the celebration of cacao.

That&#8217;s not to say that ChocoSol merely glorifies a nutritious bean, their entire raison d&#8217;être is to bring cacao back to its origins as a &#8220;food of the gods&#8221;. Those origins lie in Mesoamerica, home to Aztecs and Mayans, and the birthplace of the cacao plant. To the indigenous people of Mesoamerica, cacao was valued for its taste as well as its medicinal, divine and aphrodisiac properties. Perhaps there is some wisdom behind Valentines day consumerism. The Aztec Emperor, Montezuma was said to drink the Aztec cacao beverage, xocolatl, 50 times a day from a golden goblet. Such was its power that he is rumoured to have called it,

> &#8220;the divine drink, which builds up resistance and fights fatigue. A cup of this precious drink permits a man to walk for a whole day without food&#8221;

[What Montezuma wanted with 50 days worth of walking energy in one day is beyond me]. Xocolatl was also drunk by the Aztec warriors and used in sacred rituals. The ubiquitous use of the cacao rendered it synonymous with currency; one bean could be traded for one tamale, while a hundred beans were worth a good turkey or a slave -It seems that fair-trade had its own problems in those days. The cacao was a food that propelled and facilitated social interactions through the potlatch; a festival that was marked by material exchange, denoting of social hierarchy, and cultural rituals. Wealth was not measured by the amount of possessions retained. Rather, as cacao was a perishable currency, one&#8217;s wealth was measured by the amount of wealth one could bless others with.  In other words, it was consumerism in reverse.

Since its introduction into Europe, America and Asia, cacao has undergone various transformations from the sweetening of Spain to the decadence of France to the industrialization of Germany, England and the Netherlands.  What was once esteemed as the food of the gods was distilled, extracted, boxed and packaged. Finally, entrapped in a paper prison called product, chocolate was demoted to the marketplace. The people at ChocoSol, affectionately called, the ChocoSolistas, have made it their mission to bring cacao back to its former glory, as a rich food that permeates culture and enriches society. A belief they not only preach but practice as Barry and I both left with some food and wisdom of the gods.
