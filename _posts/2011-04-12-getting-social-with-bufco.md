I bumped into Arlene Hazzan Green, co-owner of [Bufco][1] At[ Canada Blooms][2]. Â Arlene, whom I initially met through [Twitter][3], was so excited about all of the traffic coming to the Bufco website through social media that she couldn&#8217;t stop talking about it&#8211;even as she ran back to her booth to demonstrate her amazing raised beds for urban backyard gardeners.

Arlene reads books about seeds and soil, not books by [Chris Brogan][4] and [Clay Shirkey,][5] but she has a natural understanding and affinity for how social media works. Maybe it&#8217;s because she understands how to ensure ecosystems thrive or maybe it&#8217;s because she&#8217;s a natural storyteller&#8211;she started out in film and television.

Whatever the reason, Arlene gets it. Check out [her blog ][6]and hear what she has to say in her own words.
