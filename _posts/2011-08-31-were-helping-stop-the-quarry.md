**FABULOUS UPDATE: **

Natural Resources Minister[ John Wilkinson announced that a full Environmental Assessment ][1]will be required in order for the Quarry to proceed in Melancthon County. Normally a full assessment of this kind would not be required. This is a major first victory for the many organizations who have been working tirelessly to make this happen. Congrats.  
Momentum is building among those actively opposing the proposed Mega Quarry in Melancthon County. We&#8217;re spotting Stop the Quarry signs on more and more lawns across Ontario, and events and rallies are scheduled right up to the October 6 provincial election.

Stop the Quarry has launched a billboard campaign to encourage people to ensure their MPPs and candidates are taking a stand on the issue.

We&#8217;re helping ensure that Stop the Quarry&#8217;s word is spreading far and wide by creating a [Stop the Quarry][2] website (www.nomegaquarry.ca) to support their campaign. It&#8217;s brand new so not everything&#8217;s there yet. But visit [the site][3], their [facebook page][4] and follow them on Twitter @nomegaquarry to keep on top of the issues.

If you&#8217;re looking for a fun way to protest, check out [Foodstock ][5]hosted by Michael Stadtlander on October 16th. Hope to see you there.
