I moved to Toronto in &#8217;96 with a fresh degree in advertising design from a great institution and [program][1], and was relatively bright eyed and cheery about my opportunities.

I got a gig at Saatchi, and started my morning walks across downtown Toronto.

It wasn&#8217;t long before several things about the experience started to conflict with my values, but I&#8217;ll never forget realizing that I&#8217;d started to put my head down as I was walking to work. The visual cacophony of marketing message blinking and blathering were wrecking a perfectly pleasant walk. They also, as much as anything, set me on the career path I&#8217;ve been on since.

I saw this video this morning and felt like it was chicken soup for my values.



The fact is that while plenty of media power has shifted to consumers, there&#8217;s also a lot more media over all. It&#8217;s probably worth re-watching this from time to time.
