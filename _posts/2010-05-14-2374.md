I just had a great Cuban lunch at a French restaurant. [Delux][1], a hot spot on Ossington Ave has opened for lunch. Instead of serving the traditional bistro fare they do so beautifully at night, they decided to give their lunch a Cuban bent.

The chef and owner Corrina Mozo is a Montrealer with Cuban roots, so the mix of cultures comes naturally. Way back in 2008 when they first opened Mozo said &#8220;French bistro dishes just call to me. I was going to do French-Cuban, but once the Canadian winter hit, I couldn&#8217;t do it,&#8221; ([Toronto Star, 2008][2])

Turns out Delux didn&#8217;t just serve up a great Cuban lunch (the Avocado, citrus, green olive salad is crazy-good) they also reminded me of an important lesson in branding.

What is Delux doing messing with their slam dunk French food by serving  Cuban during the day? Are they French or Cuban?  The short answer is they are animating their brand.

Delux&#8217;s food has always had something of a Cuban bent. But, as the chef discussed with me today, those two genres of food don&#8217;t &#8216;fuse&#8217; together easily&#8211;thus making true fusion cooking an impossibility. So, they brought Cuban food and flavour into the mix in an entirely different way.

People tend to be very rigid when they think about their brand. They believe their logo has to look the same wherever it goes (with the same PMS colour). That their website needs to have the same copy as their brochure. That they need to say the same thing about themselves over and over (and over) again.

They forget what we know about people. Your friend can change his clothes, hairstyle, cologne. And, he still remains himself. This is true of brands as well. Consider&#8230;.

*   When we reprinted our business cards recently, everyone got their own brand new colour. They are our warmer weather colours. In fact, back in the day, Hypenotic had a day card and a night card&#8211;each with it&#8217;s own colour palate. People loved them
*   [Fiesta Farms&#8217; ][3]website header literally changes with the weather. Visit to see our spring treatment before it turns to summer (that reminds me, we&#8217;ve got to start working on that).
*   Philippe Stark designs [fancy-shmantsy hotels ][4]and makes cheap, functional stuff for [Target][5]
*   The Mumps vaccine is a serious subject. The Ontario Government&#8217;s website is [loaded with information ][6]about why you should be vaccinated. But that didn&#8217;t stop them (and their agency [Partners + Edell][7]) from making a funny spot about the mumps. 

Now that you&#8217;ve seen an ad about the impact of the Mumps on one&#8217;s balls, you probably don&#8217;t feel like eating Conch Fritters. But when you go you go Delux, they&#8217;re not to be missed. Oh, and don&#8217;t miss the donuts either.
