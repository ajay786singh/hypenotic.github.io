Here at [Hypenotic][1], our office has been abuzz this past week. A big part of the excitement stemmed from the focused push to launch a shiny new website on Friday at [CanadianImmigrant.ca][2], the companion to Canadian Immigrant magazine.

The project has offered some great insight into Meaningful Marketing at work.

It&#8217;s worth mentioning thatÂ [CanadianImmigrant.ca][2] is a commercial property, part of a larger traditional media enterprise that relies heavily on site traffic and page views to drive ad revenue. And they watch their metrics closely.

But spend any time with Online Director, Leslie Andrachuk, and her diverse team, and you&#8217;ll meet an insightful bunch who are equally committed to the role they play in championing the needs of immigrants to Canada.

Through a very engaging brainstorm early on, we helped the team clarify the opportunities they have to curate helpful content, bring clarity in the midst of complexity, and provide a meaningful space for prospective and new Canadians to build a community. A space to share their aspirations, successes and even frustrations.

The technology that supports the community piece will roll out in the coming weeks, along with other refinements. This weekend we&#8217;re savouring the satisfaction of having come so far already in phase one.

And we&#8217;re grateful that we&#8217;ve had the opportunity to meet and partner with a team that has the heart and the will to engage their audience with respect and dignity.

A team that believes that the surest way to improve their bottom line is to create meaning and value for others.

More soon.
