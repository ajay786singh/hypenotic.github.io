As the Internet has quickly become one of the most ideal platforms for entrepreneurs to grow ideas on, the engineering side has thrived with a plethora of technologies that allow us to create these dynamic, data-driven experiences. There is now an abundance of tools, frameworks and tutorials available to aid engineers and developers with getting these sites and apps up and running.

With all these new tools, comes fierce loyalty and dispute about which is better and why. In an ideal world, I think these tools were always meant to co-exist in harmony, allowing developers to choose a workflow that suits them, and helps them efficiently complete the tasks at hand. Many of these evangelists will berate other tech simply because it works better for them. The assumption that it works best for everyone is, at best, foolish. As a [PHP][1] developer, I openly admit I’m not a fan of [Ruby/Rails][2], or [Python][3]. The syntax structure just isn’t my cup of tea. However, there are piles of developers and engineers who love that type of syntax style and are very proficient at writing code with it. This doesn’t make one better than the other, it simply gives developers a choice to code to their tastes. Any site/app written in PHP can be written with Ruby or Python, and vice-versa.

As developers, we should be celebrating the choices we have to build the things we love. We should recognize and acknowledge the strengths and weaknesses of each tool, and ultimately choose the best one for the job.
