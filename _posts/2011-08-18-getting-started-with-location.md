    A couple of weeks ago, a <a title="Chef Chris McDonald on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/#!/cavachef">Chris McDonald</a> of Cava (restaurant) fame restaurant asked me about a great social platform called <a title="Foodspotting app" href="http://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/foodspotting/id350727118?mt=8">Foodspotting</a>. I saw the founder <a title="Soraya Darabi on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/#!/sorayadarabi">Soraya Darabi </a>speak at <a title="The 99% Conference 2011" href="http://the99percent.com/articles/6979/99-Conference-2011-Speaker-Announcement">the 99% Conference</a> this year. And we&#8217;re both Trustees of <a title="Awesome Food chapter link" href="http://www.awesomefood.net/">Awesome: Food</a>, the Food chapter of the <a title="The Awesome Foundation" href="http://awesomefoundation.org/">Awesome Foundation</a>. She&#8217;s awesome, and I&#8217;d like to support. But I&#8217;m always concerned about business people creating more hamster wheels instead of choosing their platforms strategically.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To this end, I recommend do a bit of groundwork first.  The first thing I&#8217;d be doing is claiming, editing and monitoring my location profiles on platforms like:
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://foursquare.com/">Foursquare</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a class="zem_slink" title="Gowalla" href="http://gowalla.com" rel="homepage">Gowalla</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.google.com/places/">Google Places</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a class="zem_slink" title="Yelp" href="http://yelp.com" rel="homepage">Yelp</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.facebook.com/places">Facebook Places</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://ourfaves.com/">Our Faves</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div>
  <p>
    It&#8217;s pretty easy:
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Just google each one to find their site
    </li>
    <li>
      Find a link that says something along the lines of &#8220;claim my venue/business&#8221; and claim it (you may need to prove you own it by answering a text or email)
    </li>
    <li>
      Edit your business profile to the extent each will allow you
    </li>
    <li>
      Then monitor them (most will send you updates) for comments, good and bad
    </li>
    <li>
      Respond usefully to comments and use insights to inform with platforms to start using
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>

<div>
  It&#8217;s worthwhile for 4 reasons:
</div>

<div>
  <ol>
    <li>
      You can build relationships with people who use these networks and platforms
    </li>
    <li>
      These profiles and comments come up in search, so you can balance negative comments with fair, reasonable responses
    </li>
    <li>
      Turning vocal detractors into advocates is a powerful thing for others to see, and converts make the best fanatics for your cause
    </li>
    <li>
      When people search for your name, they&#8217;ll find you being useful, interesting and social, giving you an edge over businesses with no voice
    </li>
  </ol>
