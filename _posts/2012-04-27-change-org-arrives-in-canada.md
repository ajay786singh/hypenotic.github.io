  What do doughnuts, Canadian youth and potable water have in common? They are related to three of the high profile petitions currently circulating because of online platform Change.org.
</p>

Using [Change.org][1] Canadians have spearheaded campaigns to;

*   [Encourage Tim Hortons][2] to stop using pork and eggs from farms with inhumane practices
*   Make sure the [Canadian Government ensures that there&#8217;s safe, potable water][3] in First Nations communities
*   [Influence the Minister of Canadian Heritage][4] to reconsider shutting down youth organization, Katimavik

Change.org already has 450,000 Canadians signed up as members and they&#8217;re in their early days.

Now the platform has on-the-ground Canadian presence in the form of Campaigns Director [Jordy Gold][5] and his associate Campaigner Lauryn Drainie.  Jordy and I are on the [Not for From the Tree ][6]Steering Committee together and since entering his new role I&#8217;ve enjoyed listening to him literally overflow with enthusiasm for the impact Change.org is having all around the world. Results like getting the [MPAA to overturn its &#8216;R&#8217; rating of the &#8216;Bully&#8217; movie ][7]and stopping the [spread of Pink Slime][8] in meat products in schools across the US make me undertand what he&#8217;s so jazzed about.

So what does on the ground Canadian presence for Change.org mean? I asked Jordy the same question. His response? Change.org in Canada means:

*   A stronger push than ever to get more Canadians engaged in the issues featured on Change.org
*   Exponential impact for the petitions that resonate with Canadians. When a campaign catches on, Change.org takes notice and steps in to provide campaign support and spread the word. More Canadians will get this kind of support.
*   More &#8220;Canadian-Content&#8221; that truly speaks to the people of the true north strong and free

There&#8217;s never been a better time to start a petition on Change.org. Mine the site for tips and tricks to build a killer campaign and spread the word. In the meantime,  watch out for Canadian campaigns getting more profile than ever.
