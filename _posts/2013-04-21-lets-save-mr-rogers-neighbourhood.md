I&#8217;m a little late to the party because I don&#8217;t own a TV, but I did catch Target&#8217;s new jingle, the theme song to [Mr. Rogers&#8217; Neighbourhood][1], on the radio as a celebration of Target&#8217;s arrival in Canada. The brazen disconnect between Target&#8217;s and Mr. Rogers&#8217; view of neighbourliness sent me digging to find out more about the campaign.

Because I&#8217;m coming to this a tad late, many others have already taken the [opportunity to slam ][2]the licensing of the Mr. Rogers&#8217; theme song. Most of the criticism is based on the fact that Target&#8217;s values are so out of step with Mr. Rogers&#8217; often articulated values <span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"> of kindness and his life-long ethos of never &#8220;selling out&#8221; his kindness to brands who came knocking. Even brands like Burger King who used his likeness in a parody ad were <a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&dat=19840509&id=aeYNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=G24DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5599,1936560">shut down by Fred Rogers himself.</a></span>

<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">However, I think there&#8217;s a much simpler point to be made about Target&#8217;s use of the Mr. Rogers&#8217; theme song. The contradiction is a plain as the buttons on Mr. Rogers&#8217; cardigan. </span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><br /> </span>

Boys and girls, please, take a moment to watch and listen along with me.



Mr. Rogers looks straight at all the boys and girls singing &#8220;I have always wanted a neighbour just like you, I&#8217;ve always wanted to live in a neighbourhood with you.&#8221;* You* are his ideal neighbour. He has aspirations for *you and *sees* **you* as a de facto good neighbour.

In Target&#8217;s version of the neighbourhood, the ideal neighbour drinks  lemonade served out of a kitchy and convenient dispenser at a community gathering, neighbourly friends help haul a bold red bathtub up some stairs and children gather at the beach to fly colourful kites, all apparently purchased at your local Target store. Boys and girls, let&#8217;s see the colourful, fun and convivial world that Target envisions for all of us.



<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">The people in Target&#8217;s welcome video all  congregate. But is that really what happen&#8217;s when Target comes to town? </span>

<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Let&#8217;s take a moment to reflect on what some of the research says happens to the ethos of neighbourliness when big box stores like Target comes to town. We won&#8217;t talk about local economy or sustainability here (two huge issues in their own right), just plain old neighbourliness. Here&#8217;s what the research says:</span>

*   <span style="line-height: 12.997159004211426px;"><a href="http://www.theatlanticcities.com/neighborhoods/2012/04/big-box-stores-linked-presence-hate-groups/1745/">The presence of big box stores increases  hate crimes</a>: A rise in the incidences of hate crimes is linked to big box stores because these stores reduce social cohesion and displace local social leaders in the form of local business owners, etc.. Social alienation is the fuel that fires hatred. I get it.</span>
*   [Voter turnout drops][3]: Similarly, when political organizations, and business groups are displaced as downtowns give way to sprawl people are more inclined to be apathetic about their communities are thus less inclined to be  civically engaged and show their engagement at the ballot box.
*   In fact, [these and other studies show that virtually every single measurable indicator of neighbourliness ][4]from the number of scout groups in a town to a the number of Rotary clubs drop drastically when big box stores come to town.

Perhaps the good news is that once these football field sized stores are deemed too small, [ the giant stores are reclaimed for civic use, like libraries, community centres. ][5] In her book[ Big Box Reuse,][6] Julia Christensen explains this is because big box stores often negotiate lease agreements stating that competition can&#8217;t touch the store for 15 years. So, since the town paid for the damned  infrastructure to build the (damned) store in the first place, they&#8217;re in a position to reclaim it.

So, while Target can&#8217;t wait to meet me, I&#8217;m going to avoid introducing myself to my local big box store anytime soon. Target is neither the kind of  neighbour I want to have nor (more importantly) the kind of neighbour I want to be.

Let&#8217;s wrap this up with Mr. Rogers&#8217; goodbye message for children big and small when he finally ended the show&#8217;s run in 2001. Mr. Rogers still has high aspirations for us kids. Let&#8217;s not let him down.
