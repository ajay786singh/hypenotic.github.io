<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1747" title="Screen shot 2010-01-19 at 11.00.26 AM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Screen-shot-2010-01-19-at-11.00.26-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2010-01-19 at 11.00.26 AM" width="201" height="249" />The popular culinary magazine [Saveur][1] made the smart decision turn the reigns of this year&#8217;s Saveur 100 over to the readers. Editor-in-Chief [James Oseland][2] asks &#8220;Why should a cooking publication be a one way street, with information dictated by a small crew of largely Manhattan-based magazine editors? Why shouldn&#8217;t it be a dialogue?&#8221;

And that&#8217;s just what they did. Saveur readers submitted fantastic finds like the Sacred Heard Church ravioli dinner in Cincinnati, Ohio and divine looking [Ines Rosales Olive Oil Tortas ][3]

Not only was life suddenly easier for Saveur magazine who had gobs of content supplied by readers, but the content was far more interesting. Just knowing that someone in their living room felt passionate enough to write Saveur and tell them about their culinary find made it worth reading. And, the conversation continues online. A readers&#8217; recipe for [chocolate gravy ][4] has erupted into a friendly debate about the origins of a traditional treat of chocolate smeared on toast.

Nice work Saveur recognizing the massive movement of foodies online and helping bring their contributions to loyal Saveur readers.
