As a marketer who works for organizations making systems and sectoral change, I know what it takes to help busy people notice and address big ideas.

### Beer.

Craft beer and local sustainable fare to be precise. In a great setting like the CBC Barbara Frum Atrium. Throw in multiple live music live acts, a silent auction and an easy-going crowd and you&#8217;ve got a real shot at introducing people to some important ideas.

### Enter: <a title="Brewer's Plate Toronto" href="http://www.brewersplatetoronto.org/" target="_blank">The Brewer&#8217;s Plate 2013</a>.

Celebrating its 6th year this April 17th, attendees will experience one of the most delectable, convivial and entertaining ways to be introduced to a really dynamic part of Ontario&#8217;s food sector.

25 Ontario craft beer makers sharing their work paired with a raft of Ontario&#8217;s most creative and conscious chefs and artisans donating their efforts, with proceeds going to <a href="http://www.notfarfromthetree.org/" target="_blank">Not Far From the Tree</a>.

The chefs range from legends like Chris McDonald (<a title="Cava Restaurant" href="http://www.cavarestaurant.ca/#home" target="_blank">Cava</a>) to a certified <a title="B Corporation" href="http://www.bcorporation.net/" target="_blank">B Corp</a> social entrepreneur  Chris Klugman (<a title="Paintbox Bistro" href="http://www.paintboxbistro.ca/" target="_blank">Paintbox Bistro</a>).

And the Artisans include Chocosol, Evelyn&#8217;s crackers, Monforte Dairy, and&#8230;what happens if I drool on my keyboard?

<a title="Buy Tickets to the Brewer's Plate" href="http://www.brewersplatetoronto.org/buytickets.html" target="_blank">You should come.</a>

To whet your appetite, we&#8217;ve thrown together a poster illustrating the range of craft beers currently being produced by members of the Ontario Craft Brewers®.

Ontario&#8217;s burgeoning craft beer industry and hyper-established local sustainable food scene are made up of the kinds of small and medium sized businesses that:

*   Drive our economy (Small and medium sized businesses (like craft breweries) employ 64% of private sector workers in Canada, creating 6.7 million jobs
*   Build community (local ownership does wonders for local investment)
*   Hire more local labour, buy more local goods for resale and buy more services from local businesses than global brands/chains
*   Put in as much as love as they can rather than as little as they can get away with (subjective, but it sure feels true, doesn&#8217;t it?)
*   And they give back to local charities, like this year&#8217;s Brewer&#8217;s Plate beneficiary, <a title="Not Far From The Tree" href="http://www.notfarfromthetree.org/" target="_blank">Not far From The Tree</a>

But you don&#8217;t need to think about all of that right now. You need to <a title="Buy tickets for the Brewer's Plate 2013" href="http://www.brewersplatetoronto.org/buytickets.html" target="_blank">buy a ticket</a> for a delectable, convivial and memorable party on April 17th.
