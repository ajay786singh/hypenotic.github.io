In a department store, two very mainstream brands of women&#8217;s pants, namely [Levis][2] and [Lee][3] were selling clothes that claim to &#8220;hide your muffin top.&#8221; But of course, as the label says, &#8220;Ssssh&#8230;it&#8217;s our little secret.&#8221;

Don&#8217;t know what a muffin top is? Well, thankfully the [Oxford Dictionary][4] has included it in its most recent edition, defining it as, &#8220;a protuberance of flesh above the waistband of a tight pair of trousers.&#8221;

At the same time that it&#8217;s out in the open, the muffin top has become a source of shame. It&#8217;s kind of like the new mullet. Whole websites like [Muffinhuntin][5] exist solely to shine a spotlight on women&#8217;s abdominal &#8220;protuberances.&#8221;

Let&#8217;s face it, most women with muffin tops are moms. A flabby belly is one of the markers of having bore children. This muffin top hating is a slap in the face to moms who not only bear the responsibility of childbirth but its long lasting effects on their stomachs.

Even though we think of girdles as a vestige from an oppressive past, they were a whole lot more comfy than their more &#8216;modern&#8217; successor [Spanxs.][6] Check out this [Ode to Girdles][7] in which the writer praises &#8220;the miraculous smoothing effect of what I fondly call My Garments.&#8221;

I think it&#8217;s time to reclaim the muffin top or the girdle. It&#8217;s one or the other people. If you&#8217;re inclined to embrace girdle-dom there are plenty out there. Check out[ ebay][8] or sites like [Little Pink Dress.][9]

And, if you&#8217;re more inclined to wear your muffin top like a battle wound, check out this great video parody of Lady Gaga&#8217;s Poker Face called Muffin Top with great lyrics including:Â &#8220;Before these kids my bod was the bomb. Now I take my top off and I look like my mom.&#8221;



Which choice do you prefer? I&#8217;m on the fence on this one.
