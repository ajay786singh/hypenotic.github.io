  Lake Gibson, located in the Niagara Region is home to two historic bridges, one of which is up for demo in 2014. Beaverdam Road Bridge boasts v-lacing, battens and riveted built- up beams, and is ranked a 7 on 10 from the <a href="http://www.historicbridges.org/bridges/browser/?bridgebrowser=truss/beaverdams/">Historic Bridge Organization</a>. This bridge is to be replaced by &#8216;a mundane structure&#8217; instead of being repaired.

When I was a kid, I wanted to be a bridge architect. I would make models of all kinds of bridges out of spaghetti and glue because they had such fun designs. Reflecting now, those fun designs make so much sense. The act of crossing a bridge is awesome, and bridges should boast something of this in their physical design.

However nowadays, new bridges lean towards the ordinary. Has the joy of traversing across river, land, and lake IN THE SKY gotten old? I think not. But if we&#8217;re not going to invest the time to make designs that give thought to usage in more ways then functionality, then we have no business designing. In which case, repairing old bridges seems to be the only good option.

The deadline to oppose this project passed on Oct 5th, but <a href="http://www.niagararegion.ca/news/notices/sep0520132.aspx" target="_blank">click here</a> for more information on getting involved!
