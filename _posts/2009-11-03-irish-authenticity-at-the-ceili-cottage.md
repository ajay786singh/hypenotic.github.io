I&#8217;m not a food critic and this is not a restaurant review.  This is about what happens when autheticity matters.

[The Ceili Cottage][1] is a cozy Irish Pub in Toronto&#8217;s Leslieville neigbourhood. In a town known for a string of pubs Irish in name only, The Ceili Cottage strives to deliver a remarkable experience. But, the experience is all in the details.

First off, if you needed evidence of Patrick and his wife Alison&#8217;s commitment to all things Irish and Local, the fact that they are providing [The Gilchrist-Canavan School of Irish Dance][2] space behind the cottage should be all the proof you need. The additional I[rish music lessons and a Shucker Club ][3]ought to knock your cynicism out cold.

Beyond this, there are tartan blankets distributed when it&#8217;s chilly on the patio, a fine array of Irish beers on tap, pickled eggs on the menu, and oyster shells literally built into the patio floor. Their menu offers a roast dinner on Monday, and then transforms the remaining meat throughout the week (curried on Thursday, broth on Sunday).

What is most interesting about Ceili Cottage are the responses it&#8217;s generated. A positive review on [Martini Boys][4] generated 24 comments. A negative review on [Blog T.O][5] resulted in 84 comments. Given Groundswell&#8217;s 10/9/90 rule these are pretty impressive stats.<!--more-->

These comments seem to fall into 2 camps:

*   Disappointed Downers: Seem overjoyed that Ceili&#8217;s cottage has fallen short in terms of service or food
*   Loving Loyalists: Rush to support Ceili&#8217;s Cottage despite whatever shortcomings one may encounter

This is the basic Vegetarian Conundrum. Take a stand (&#8220;I&#8217;m a vegetarian&#8221;) and many will do whatever it takes yank you off your pedestal (&#8220;what about leather, you wear leather right?).

[Caplansky&#8217;s][6] ran into the same issue. They claimed to be an authentic Jewish deli. 1/2 the world will loved them even though they (sometimes) run out of smoked meat. The others, bash them at every opportunity.

So what&#8217;s a brand to do? Both The Ceili Cottage and Caplansky&#8217;s offer some hints at how to maintain authenticity, support the loyalists and quiet the nay sayers:

*   Be Part of the Conversation: Both Zane Caplansky and Patrick McMurray blog, Tweet and respond to comments.
*   Keep Calm and Carry On: Respond to the naysayers with measured calmness. Never lose your cool. Patrick begins his response to some scathing comments on BlogTO with &#8220;Thanks for all of the comments, and the review. All is fair.&#8221; How can you hate a guy like that?
*   Thank the Fans: For his final restaurant review, the Toronto Star&#8217;s Corey Mintz wrote a [glowing review of Caplansky&#8217;s ][7] and Zane, in turn made a point of thanking [Corey in his blog][8]
*   Don&#8217;t get distracted. The naysayers will always be there whenever you try to do/be something special. But remember, no one bothered to comment on The Pickle Barrel&#8217;s smoked meat or the Irish Stew at the [Fox and the Firkin][9]
