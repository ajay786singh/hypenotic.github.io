There are at least 18 lakes named Cedar Lake in Ontario so it&#8217;s hard to say which one the 70&#8242;s folk group &#8220;Cedar Lake&#8221; was named for.

The folk band included Canadian music luminaries like brothers [Stan][1] and [Garnet Rogers][2] and a host of other well-known folkies. The band had about 20 members at its peak.

In some ways the band sounds like an old-fashioned version of [Broken Social Scene.][3] But the band was more broken than on the scene. They lasted less than a year.

According to an [online bio on Garnet Rogers,][2] Rogers told the *Boston Globe* that the band Cedar Lake consisted of:

> &#8220;A bunch of complete and utter lunatics, really disgusting, underrehearsed weirdo hippies, most of whom have found well-deserved obscurity.&#8221;

Sounds like an awesome band. In fact, I think they need to stage a revival at[ Casinorama][4] some time soon.
