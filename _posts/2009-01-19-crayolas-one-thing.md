The world is filled with many different coloring instruments. But I buy [Crayola][1]. I could buy colored pencils at the dollar store or smelly markers at Walmart. But, I don&#8217;t.  I buy Crayola markers for one reason&#8211;they wipe off. That&#8217;s what parents care about. When your 2 year old hits the kitchen cabinets with a Magenta marker, you are grateful to those genius chemists at Crayola who figured out how to make a marker that wipes off. 

Maybe the others do and I just don&#8217;t know about it. But they didn&#8217;t say it on their packaging and I&#8217;m not willing to take that chance. 

This is a brilliant case of knowing your market and knowing what they care about. Who buys markers? Not kids. Parents, and more specifically, moms do.  All markers color. Only one brand wipes off. 

The [Crayola website][1] doesn&#8217;t even mention this incredible benefit. There have to be some great stories parents could tell about wiping crayons off the walls and worshiping at the alter of Crayola for making stuff that comes off. Looking at other peoples&#8217; mess would feel good for once. There Crayola, I just gave you your next great idea. A social campaign focusing on Crayola&#8217;s wipe-ability.
