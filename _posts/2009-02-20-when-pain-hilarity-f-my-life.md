Quick sample:

<div class="post">
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      &#8220;Today, I returned home from college and saw a framed picture of my parents and my younger sister on an elephant in an exotic jungle. I pointed to the picture and asked my mom, &#8220;Is this some photoshop job?&#8221; She responded, &#8220;No, we went to Thailand for a family trip, didn&#8217;t we tell you? FML&#8221;

    <p>
      &#8220;Today, I saw a elderly man fall in a crosswalk, so I jumped off my bike to help. As I helped him across, the light turned green. At that point I noticed my phone had fallen out of my pocket in the street and was run over by several cars. I then watched across a 6 lane street as someone stole my bike. FML&#8221;

      &#8220;Today, after class, my teacher pulled me aside and said &#8220;You know, I never received the e-mail regarding your disabilities that your parents mentioned. Could you have them resend it?&#8221; What disabilities? FML&#8221;

            &#8220;Today, I went to Macy&#8217;s to go shopping, I was wearing a shirt and tie and dressed nicely. Customers came to for questions, but I just ignored them. Minutes later, thinking I was an employee, the manager came and yelled at me, and threatened to fire me. FML&#8221;
