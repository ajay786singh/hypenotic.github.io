This week we&#8217;re using the space normally dedicated to an Ontario Lakes logo to raise an issue that is of great importance to those of us that love Ontario lakes and are in the habit of using water.

The Experimental Lakes are 58 lakes that have been used for cutting edge research that has brought about important changes in regulations around water. Like the link between detergent phosphates and green algae? Researchers from the Experimental Lakes figured that one out, and the result has been a monumental shift in how detergent is manufactured in this country. And that&#8217;s just one small example, but there are [many, many more.][1]

The CBC said it best back in May

> The ELA is also internationally known for research into everything from acid rain to climate change to fish farming â€” essentially, all the ways that human activity can affect freshwater systems.

If you want to do declare the slated 2013 shutting down of Experimental Lakes a bad idea, [sign the petition][2] and stand up for fresh water.
