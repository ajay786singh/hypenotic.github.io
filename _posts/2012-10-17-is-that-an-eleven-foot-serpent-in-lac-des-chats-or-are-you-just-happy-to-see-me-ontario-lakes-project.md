  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lac_des_Chats"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9996" title="Lac des Chats" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Lac-des-Chats-580x712.png" alt="" width="278" height="342" />Lac Des Chats</a> on the Ottawa river forming the boundary between Ontario and Quebec has quite a strange and slithery history. Below you&#8217;ll find part of an article from the Stevens Point Herald, dated 1882 announcing the killing of an infamous serpent lurking in the waters of Lac Des Chats (sourced directly from <a href="http://www.cryptomundo.com/cryptozoo-news/chats-kill/">Cryptomundo</a>)

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      But this week we are in a position to announce the capture of what is probably one of the progeny of the original old Chats Lake serpent, which has often struck terror to the hearts of the superstitious river men&#8230;.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      They succeeded in getting within striking distance of the serpent when Mr. Durgan struck it a blow over the head with his oar. The beast then turned and made for the occupants of the boat, literally churning the water with his tail in his fury. Another powerful and well-directed blow with an oar on the neck of the serpent laid it out dead when it was taken in tow and brought aboard the steamer.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The crew of the boat stretched it out on the rail and measured it with a rule. Its total length was eleven feet, while the body was thirteen inches in circumference. Its jaws were pried open and a pair of compasses inserted, which were opened out to a distance of six inches.

    Now that&#8217;s a big snake. Wonder if any other progeny are still lurking in Lac Des Chats. Who&#8217;s game to find out?
