I recently treated myself to a facial. It is not something I do often because the cost/benefit equation doesn&#8217;t generally make sense to me. In other words, it&#8217;s expensive and I don&#8217;t fool myself into believing that it will produce long-term, radical benefits to my skin.

I suspended rational judgment to engage in an experience that would be pleasurable, relaxing and uplifting. In his book[ Making Meaning][1] Nathan Shedroff describes [15 core values][2] that, leveraged strategically, create meaningful customer experiences. This is a phenomenon Shedroff calls &#8220;meaningful consumption&#8221;  as opposed to &#8220;simply responding based on features, price, brand identity and emotional pitches.&#8221;

So, how does this work? The spa experience falls under the meaningful experience Shedroff calls beauty: &#8220;The appreciation of qualities that give pleasure to the senses or spirit.&#8221; The spa I went to seemed well positioned to deliver this meaningful experience. The decor was calming and simple, the products they use (and sell) are all natural, the table I laid on was the ultimate in comfort. &#8220;Bring on the beauty&#8221; my soul cried.

The facial was lovely. 15 mins in I looked up and asked &#8220;what kind of facial is this anyway?&#8221; She explained it was called a Simple facial but then noted that my skin looked dehydrated and I should consider the super-hydrating facial. And as an afterthought &#8220;I should tell you, it&#8217;s $20 more.&#8221; And, in the bliss of that moment, I willingly conceded to turn a blind-eye to being super-sized and said yes to the indulgent upgrade.<!--more Continue Reading &raquo;-->

At the end of the facial, I was left alone to dress. I saw the spa&#8217;s schedule on the counter. Writ large under my name was: *&#8220;wants simple facial, try to sell super-hydrating.&#8221;* Sell? Sell you say? This was about beauty, about my previously-dehydrated, now super-hydrated skin. .My feelings of bliss quickly washed away. Why? Because this crass display of commerce undermined the credibility of my experience.

There are other experiences like this:

*   On a day when you&#8217;re feeling particularly adventurous,  your hairdresser talks you into getting $80 highlights you neither need, nor want. When you get home you realize that, contrary to what he told you,  blond highlights don&#8217;t look natural when you&#8217;re a brunette.
*   When your experience of a tourist destination is interrupted by far too many tourist shops, calling out for you to buy souvenirs. Charge me for the trip there, charge me for lunch, but don&#8217;t make me feel duped by selling me tchotchkes.
*   When you suspect your vet, doctor, dentist, etc. is lining his pockets with tests or treatments neither you, nor your pet, really need
*   When a health store beauty product, like[ Burt&#8217;s Bees][3], gets bought up and ends up in the aisles of a major pharmacy chain

Beyond thinking about how to design meaningful experiences across a range of touch points, here are some tips that can help brands avoid undermining their best efforts:

*   Consider the long-tail: Sure, those highlights, that up-sell, or x-ray will allow you to pocket the extra dough, but what will it cost you in customer loyalty?
*   Think about distribution. Some products feel more special when they come from specialty shops.
*   Decide what you should charge for and what to give away. Give away tea, coffee and the simple things that make the experience more pleasurable.
*   Make the process of paying seamless: The moment when you reach for your wallet is the moment when it can all fall apart. Don&#8217;t make people wait (too much time to think about how much it hurts the bank-account), don&#8217;t surprise them with hidden costs, don&#8217;t crowd the cash with more products (that just makes me feel worse)
*   Help me, guide me, but don&#8217;t sell me: You can direct me to your blog where you offer tips for exfoliation or whiter teeth, but if you want to retain an ounce of cred, don&#8217;t telemarket to me.
*   Think about what you&#8217;re selling: I&#8217;ve seen foundation being sold in a  Dermatologists office. Makeup and medicine don&#8217;t mix. In fact, it makes you look like you&#8217;re more into beauty that health.
*   And finally, if there are any unfortunate notes around, just tuck them away so a poor soul like me doesn&#8217;t have to have a perfectly good facial ruined. I wanted to believe. I really did.
