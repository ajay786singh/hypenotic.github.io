Take something you would do anyway, then add a healthy dose of connection to community, mix in good feelings and stir. It&#8217;s a recipe for success.

That was my experience when hiring [Good Foot][1] delivery service to get a cheque to a supplier&#8217;s office. Good Foot is a courier service that delivers packages by foot or TTC at rates you&#8217;d expect to pay for courier services. The only difference is that all of their couriers have developmental disabilities.

As you can imagine, it&#8217;s not easy to get a job when you have a developmental disability. One of Good Foot&#8217;s founders, Kristen Gauthier, saw her brother Jon struggling to make ends meet. Good Foot was born out of their collective desire to find a way for Jon, and people like him, to get good, stable work. Today Jon is co-founder & head courier at Good Foot.

When I placed my first Good Foot order last week I had the chance to chat with John. He was kind and funny and super-helpful.  Then a guy showed up with our package after having navigated the TTC to our offices. It was a pleasure to do something as mundane as shipping a package and get a feel-great experience as a bonus.

Why did this exchange feel so good? I think it has a lot to do with being part of a community. When we joined [B Corp][2] we, as a company, were outwardly displaying our commitment to create public benefit. But an inward shift happened as well. Same with using Good Foot as our courier of choice. Here&#8217;s how I describe it:

> When you connect with others who share your values (a community) you strengthen your values and make it more likely that you&#8217;ll continue to act on them in the future.

The point is, joining up with like minded organizations like Good Foot or B Corp has given us a lot more than we bargained for. We&#8217;ll continue finding organizations that help us define the contours of our values and in turn strengthen them.

So, what organizations can you recommend to us? We&#8217;d like to find as many like minded partners as we can.
