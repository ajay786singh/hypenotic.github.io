The biggest ever quarry in Canada is proposed for a site only 100 km north of Toronto in Melancthon.

Last night, I was invited to a gathering of individuals who are actively engaged in food issues to learn more about the [proposed Mega Quarry][1]. One of the most resonant speakers of the night was Brent Preston, owner of Creemore&#8217;s [The New Farm.][2]

Brent&#8217;s brief presentation made me wonder how we could harness our collective creativity and intelligence to think differently about *time. *

Thousands of acres of [Honeywood silt loam][3], the best grade soil in the province, would be dug up to create the mega quarry. Brent asked the folks in the room to think about that soil. To *really* think about what it took to create the soil that appeared after the ice from the last ice age melted away. He asked us to consider how long it took for nature to create this soil that farmers have farmed on for generations. He asked us to think about the food that land will produce for Ontarians for tens of thousands of years if left alone.

And then he asked everyone to consider the relatively small number of people the quarry wil benefit, most of whom are part of [Highland Companies ][4]a subsidiary of an American Hedge Fund.

[The Long Now Foundation ][5]has a valuable take on time&#8211;or rather, what they call &#8220;deep time&#8221; that offers valuable perspective for discussion about the quarry. The name of the foundation comes from [Brian Eno][6], Long Now Foundation Board Member, who upon moving to New York discovered that &#8220;here and now&#8221; meant &#8220;this room&#8221;* *and &#8220;this five minutes.&#8221; The Long Now Foundation exists because the enormous challenges we face as a society require long-term thinking.

As one expression of their ideals The Long Now Foundation is building a clock they hope will be an iconic symbol that changes people&#8217;s thinking about time. They hope the clock will do for time what photos of earth from outer space did for people&#8217;s thinking about the environment. Over twenty years in the making, [The 10,000 Year Clock][7] is being built inside a mountain in Texas. The clock ticks once a year. The century hand advances once every 100 years. The cuckoo comes out on the millennium. As they say on their website:

> <span style="color: #222222; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px; font-style: italic;"><br /> Why would anyone build a clock inside a mountain with the hope that it will ring for 10,000 years? Part of the answer: just so people will ask this question, and having asked it, prompt themselves to conjure with notions of generations and millennia.</span>

You can call it an art project. You can call it a science project. But the thinking behind the 10,000 Year Clock is exactly what is needed to shut down this proposed quarry.

I&#8217;m not an inventor so I can&#8217;t come up with a crazy contraption that will help folks visualize 10,000 years into the future. But let&#8217;s take Brent&#8217;s advice. Take a trip up to the [County of Dufferin][8] and grab a handful of Honeywood Silt Loam. Hell, grab some soil from your backyard. There&#8217;s tens of thousands of years of history in that soil and tens of thousands of years of not-yet-grown crops that could potentially come from that soil. It&#8217;s a time machine and a 10,000 Year Clock all in one. It&#8217;s magic.

In comparison, it makes a pile of gravel seem like a really dumb idea. A gravel pit will rip up the land only to reduce history to a pile of rubble and destroy the land for future generations. I&#8217;m thinking that the Honeywood is the better way to go. How &#8217;bout you?
