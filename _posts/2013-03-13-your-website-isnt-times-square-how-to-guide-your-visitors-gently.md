I&#8217;ve been using [iAWriter][1] lately and loving it. It&#8217;s a delightful, distraction-free writing tool by [Information Architects][2]Â (iA), a design consultancy based in Tokyo, Zurich and Berlin.

iA brings some very thoughtful elements into their own website design that are worth considering.

In this screenshot of their blog, you&#8217;ll see a black tab on the right with an estimate of how long it should take to finish reading the post. We don&#8217;t all read at the same pace, of course, but they&#8217;re leaving it to me to decide whether this is worth my time.

<div id="attachment_10682" style="width: 515px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

    Thoughtful advice about user-centred design from iA
  </p>
</div>

Very considerate.

iA are an opinionated bunch, and it&#8217;s worth noting some of the opinions expressed on this [post on web typography][3]:

> *   Don&#8217;t tell us to adjust the font size
> *   Don&#8217;t tell us busy pages look better
> *   Don&#8217;t tell us scrolling is bad

They&#8217;re fighting for user experience and they&#8217;re taking no prisoners.

If you work in a large organization, you may have stakeholders clamouring for their share of the home page. Everyone wants a billboard on [Times Square][4].

But consider&#8230;

If everything stands out, nothing stands out.

If everything&#8217;s important, nothing&#8217;s important.

If everything&#8217;s urgent, you risk losing your visitors to overwhelm.

Creating useful design is as much about figuring out what to take away as knowing what to include.

Rather than foisting organizational priorities on visitors, consider what they might be hoping to accomplish. And then help them do it.

This shift in perspective could change everything.

Here are three things you can do next:

1.  Get fierce about setting priorities for your site. Instead of bludgeoning your visitors, guide them gently. Many will follow.
2.  Get [iA Writer for your Mac, iPad and iPhone][5] for simple, uncluttered, distraction-free writing (you can thank me later).
3.  Share your thoughts in the comments below.
