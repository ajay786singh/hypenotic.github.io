It&#8217;s my attempt to pull together support for the White Ribbon Campaign&#8217;s [Walk a Mile in Her Shoes][2] fundraiser, coming up on September 29th.

The [White Ribbon Campaign][3] was started by, among others, the late Jack Layton to end gender-based violence against women.

Each year men literally walk a mile wearing women&#8217;s shoes to help White Ribbon in their efforts to educate young men and boys on the issues of gender equality, respect and healthy relationships.
