[Last week I wrote about ][1]the &#8220;Downstream Downtown&#8221; event that we attended to learn more about the Mega Quarry slated for Melancthon, Ontario.

Yesterday, our friends at [Good Food Revolution][2] posted a video highlighting many of the people who also attended the event speaking about why the proposed Mega Quarry, just 1.5 hours outside of Toronto, is an issue we *all *need to be concerned about.

Today, I&#8217;m letting you that we&#8217;re deeply committed to this issue and we&#8217;ll continue lending our support in any way we can.

***But Monday is the most important day of all.***

**You have until Monday to voice your opposition to the Mega Quarry.** Please take a moment to watch the video below. Then[ register your belief ][3]that there needs to be a thorough Â environmental assessment to measure the potential impact of this monster undertaking.

If you&#8217;re looking for the issues to highlight in your note, [please refer here][4] for some helpful talking points.
