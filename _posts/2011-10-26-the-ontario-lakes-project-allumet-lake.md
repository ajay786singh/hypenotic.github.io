    Allumette Lake isn&#8217;t just any lake along the Ottawa River. This little body of water was the site of a &#8216;majah&#8217; scandal in 1613 where people were drowning in a sea of lies.

  Explorer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_de_Vignau">Nicholas de Vignau</a> travelled with an Algonquin chief named<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessouat"> Tessouat.</a> The two stopped at Allumet Lake where Tessouat told Vignau not to travel any further north because the tribes who resided there were &#8220;evil sorcerers.&#8221; Tessouat lied to Vignau (which he was in the habit of doing) to block travel north so he and his tribe could maintain control over trade with Quebec.

<div>
  Vignau went back to New France (Quebec) falsely boasting that he&#8217;d travelled north and found the Northwest Passage (Hudson&#8217;s Bay). In 1613 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_de_Champlain">Samuel de Champlain </a>followed Vignau back to the site and discovered that Vignau was a boldfaced lier.  Champlain and Vignau encountered Algonquin chief Tessouat at Allumet Island where Champlain told Tessouat of Vignau&#8217;s claim.

<div>
  Vignau was never heard from again. Tessouat  apparently told Champlain: &#8220;Give him to us, and we promise you he will tell no more lies.&#8221; All that Champlain wrote in his diary was: &#8220;We left him in God’s keeping.&#8221;

<div>
  Champlain gave up on finding the passage north and returned downstream.
