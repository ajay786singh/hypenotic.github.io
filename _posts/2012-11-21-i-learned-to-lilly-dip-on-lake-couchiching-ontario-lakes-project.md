I was a camper at <a href="http://www.wahanowin.com/about">Camp Wahanowin </a>in Orillia Ontario from eight years old for five consecutive summers. Digging through the archives, I was pleased to discover that I had received an Achievement Award for Canoeing on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Couchiching">Lake Couchiching</a> (that and an Award for Woodworking).

That Award must have been a charitable gift of sorts because I can assure you, I was not an enthusiastic canoeist. At best, I was a reluctant lily dipper. But all of these years later, I&#8217;m touched that someone, somewhere, thought to give me an award for my efforts&#8211;and of course for acknowledgement of my serious woodworking skills.

While I didn&#8217;t enjoy the temperature of Lake Couch, or being forced to swim laps with waves crashing into my face as I did *one more *lap of the crawl across its shores, I loved Camp Wahanowin and the childhood experiences I had there. Because Lake Couch was part of that experience it will forever have a very special place in my heart.
