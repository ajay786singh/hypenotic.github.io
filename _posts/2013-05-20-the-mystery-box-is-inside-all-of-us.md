A couple days ago, I was perusing the videos of TEDtalks, hunting for gems of genius, when the awesomeness of J.J. Abrams flew out of a friend&#8217;s Facebook message and smashed into my brain. He came in the form of his [Mystery Box TEDtalk][2] and here&#8217;s what he taught me:

1.  ***&#8220;Mystery is more important than knowledge&#8221;***, only because, ***&#8220;mystery is the catalyst for imagination&#8221;***. Through this, I realized that imagination perpetuates and creates knowledge. Nothing would be discovered without the wonder of mystery setting fire to the imagination. Once we imagine what the solution is, or what the solutions could be, we are on our way to knowledge.
2.  ***&#8220;Look inside yourself and figure out what&#8217;s inside of you because ultimately the mystery box is inside all of us&#8221;***. Once again, the solution- the &#8220;magic&#8221;, the knowledge- is inside of us waiting to be lit up by curiosity. Psychologists say that often there is a biological predisposition for mental illness that is triggered by environmental factors. Similarly, we have a predisposition for creativity that is triggered by mystery.
3.  As such, it is only natural to use mystery to motivate and increase creativity/imagination. In the search for answers, we will always stumble upon more questions. Over and over again this happens until we have come up with many solutions and found a million more questions. That may be why it is often the hardest to begin a project or start brainstorming; because you know if you open one door, 25 others will inevitably appear with questions of their own. So how do we face that? How do we face one question knowing that the answer is limitless, and that creativity is limitless?
4.  We do it by realizing that ***&#8220;creativity is democratized&#8221;***. It&#8217;s not 1 vs 1000 000 anymore. Everyone has the resources to implement creativity. Ironically we often don&#8217;t realize what a luxury it is that creativity is affordable, something that Abrams reminds us of. ***&#8220;No community is best served when only the elite have control&#8221;***. So take up your brains, your courage, and your allies, because you have the power to face curiosity and win creativity.
5.  The last thing I learned from J.J. Abrams: ***&#8220;Don&#8217;t hurt Tom&#8217;s nose&#8221;***, a lesson I&#8217;m sure we will all appreciate in our daily lives.
