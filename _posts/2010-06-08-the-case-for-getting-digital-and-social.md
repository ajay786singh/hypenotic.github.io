My newsletter from Yelp had some interesting numbers in it today.

Though we don&#8217;t stop to think about much it, sites like [Yelp][1], [GigPark][2], Google Biz and  even [Foursquare][3] are a great resource for qualified leads.

They sit on a continuum of usefulness that ranges from a modern version of yellow pages to reading your mind.

According to Yelp,

> *   27% of all Yelp searches come from our iPhone Application.
> *   Last month (May), **over half a million calls** were made to local businesses **directly from Yelp&#8217;s iPhone App**. That&#8217;s about 1 call every 5 seconds to a business as a result of Yelp.
> *   Nearly **a million people mapped door-to-door** **directions** to a local business from their Yelp iPhone App last month.
> And these are only the iPhone numbers. (<a title="Don't forget" href="http://www.yelp.com/yelpmobile" target="_blank">Don&#8217;t forget</a>, we&#8217;re on Android, Palm, and Blackberry as well!) In addition, Yelp&#8217;s mobile traffic is only a fraction of our total traffic. Over 32 million people visited Yelp from desktop computers in the last 30 days.

That&#8217;s a lot of people. Even if you don&#8217;t use Yelp yourself, chances are you&#8217;ve googled something and had a Yelp listing come up.

Personally, I&#8217;ve been logging on and using [Canada411.ca][4] for years instead of cluttering my small house with big phone books.

And the last time I was north of Toronto proper I found the best Szechuan I&#8217;ve had since I moved here 14 years ago using Yelp.

I&#8217;m not sure anyone has an excuse not to spend the time it takes to fill in your profiles in these places (or have someone do it for you). Some of them even let you make an offer to prospective customers for free.

What services are you using?
