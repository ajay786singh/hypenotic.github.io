Hugh at Cluetrain wrote a cool summary of the history of brand influence. The point being that the newest model, which he calls &#8220;expressive capital&#8221;, is manifest in brands taking the &#8220;Love Mark&#8221; to a new level by allowing people to believe something about themselves–to bring context to their beliefs.

> 1.  **First we had Human Capital.** You There Go to the next village and kill everybody because I&#8217;m the Chief of this village and I say so etc.

> 3.  **Then came Financial Capital.** Money, credit, dollars etc.
> 4.  **Then came Intellectual Capital. **Our widgets are better than your widgets because our engineers are smarter than your engineers etc.
> 5.  **Then came Emotional Capital.** People love our product more than they love our competitor&#8217;s product etc. This is the space &#8220;Love Marks&#8221; plays around with so successfully: &#8220;A Love Mark is a brand that is loved by its user beyond reason&#8221; etc.

It&#8217;s a bit like Seth Godin&#8217;s riff in &#8220;All Marketers are Liars&#8221;, where he suggests that it&#8217;s the marketer&#8217;s job to frame the offer/experience along lines that sync with consumers&#8217; hard-coded &#8220;world views&#8221;.

It got me thinking that neither idea goes far enough for today&#8217;s consumer climate. Instead of simply helping people believe something, find or express meaning/purpose, why not help them DO something? I mean partner with their customers to shift the needle on some point?

I guess the version of  &#8220;Social Marketing&#8221; that helps corporations leverage their Philanthropy strategically touches in this area –CIBC&#8217;s &#8220;Run for the Cure&#8221;, Ronald McDonald House and

Timberland&#8217;s &#8220;City Year&#8221; are successful examples of this. But making sure you don&#8217;t come off as capitalizing on the cause must be a tough line to tow. And even in these examples, how many people remember which non-profits are the beneficiaries?

Social media is a boon to marketers who want to pay attention to what their prospects deem worthy of espressing publicly. And of course it&#8217;s an unheralded opportunity for nimble organizations who &#8220;get it&#8221; to enage directly with their buying public for feedback on successes, failures and opportunities. But wouldn&#8217;t it be cool to find out about a brand who was using social media to partner with their public–as citizens in a community of interest, to fix something they felt was broken?

I&#8217;m going to investigate instances where a brand is teeming up with the public to change the world.

I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;e being done. Patagonia, or Trek– someone who emplys people that enjoy the outdoors (and partake) must be protecting some geographic region or something.

Anyway, here&#8217;s the original link.
