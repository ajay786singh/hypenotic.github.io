Well well well&#8230; It&#8217;s about time I introduce myself as Hypenotic&#8217;s newest Graphic Design Intern. My name is [Sabrina Smelko][1], although I&#8217;m sure you may already know that (see poster above). I am currently entering my fourth and final year at[ Sheridan College&#8217;s Bachelor of Applied Arts Illustration Program][2], so this internship is proving to be the perfect stepping stone into the industry.

Adjusting to the [early morning commute][3] has proven to be the only difficulty in my transition as an intern here at Hypenotic; the friendly and talented crew, the yummy espresso, and the adorable and cozy downtown studio space have made my first week more than enjoyable.

During my first week, I managed to wrangle up some time to finish my first assignment- this blog introduction, as well as the poster I created. I hope you all enjoy!

Happy Tuesday!
