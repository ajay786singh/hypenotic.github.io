<a rel="attachment wp-att-2474" href="http://hypenotic.com/blog/2475/2475/attachment/screen-shot-2010-05-31-at-4-40-08-pm"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2474" title="Screen shot 2010-05-31 at 4.40.08 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Screen-shot-2010-05-31-at-4.40.08-PM.png" alt="" width="241" height="335" /></a>So Kraft decided to grind a [negligible amount of cauliflower][1] into it&#8217;s KD and place it under it&#8217;s  oh-so-credible &#8220;KD Smart&#8221; moniker.

Which is the smart part? Well, according to [Yoni Freedhoff][2], Ottawa Family Doctor and founder of a multi-disciplinary, ethical, evidence-based nutrition and weight management centre (is that enough cred for you people?) a serving of this cauliflower goodness has the equivalent of 2 tablespoons of veggies as well as more fat, sugar and salt than regular KD. Oh, and it has 33% less actual KD than the other kinds.

The ad (which I spotted in [Reader&#8217;s Digest][3]) proudly introduces &#8220;Cauliflower that tastes like KD.&#8221; Yeah, that&#8217;s like calling German Chocolate Cake &#8220;Rasberries that taste like chocolate.&#8221; Or jeans, &#8220;Zippers with Legs&#8221;

And this from the folks who were behind [Michelle Obama&#8217;s anti-obesity campaign?][4] I&#8217;m stunned, really. I think that the other supporters of Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation like Pepsi, General Mills and Kellogs should kick them out of the club.
