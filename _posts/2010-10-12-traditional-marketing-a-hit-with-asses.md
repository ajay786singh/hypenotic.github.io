Traditional marketing is akin to playing &#8220;Pin-the-Tail-on-the-Donkey&#8221;. Drunk. With an increasingly agile donkey. Big brands are clueing in, but it takes time to dismantle the elaborate donkey-pin buck-shot machine they&#8217;ve invested in. And the situation isn&#8217;t being helped by:

*   Still landing a few pinsâ€“some people can&#8217;t change until they&#8217;ve exhausted all their options
*   No easy transition from an exploitative approach to a trust/relationship-based model
*   Useless products, or ones that create their margins at the expense of others don&#8217;t easily hold up under the transparency required online

Meaningful Marketing offers an approach that leads to more qualified leads. And works better when you see your prospects as people instead of donkeys.

If you (or your agency) aren&#8217;t working on a strategy to shift your marketing towards connecting with your audiences on common interests instead of targeting them with your messages, maybe it&#8217;s time to ask yourself who the ass is?
