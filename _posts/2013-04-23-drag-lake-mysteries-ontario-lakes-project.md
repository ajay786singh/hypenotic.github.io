Located in the quaint county of Haliburton, Drag Lake is, like many Ontarian lakes, a thriving cottage-country area where one will find clear, crisp water lapping against a rocky bank, a rolling blanket of pines, and loons calling to each other in the foggy distance. Though open fires are prohibited (no marshmallow roasting, sorry), the lake is not short of fun community activities, including husky walks and fishing for lakers.

In a timely article posted by the [Haliburton Echo][1] a few years ago right around Halloween, stories were told of an old family house built by one Sir William Laking in 1917 in which there were numerous ghost sightings over the years. Around the time the house was built, Mr. Laking was mourning his son, Sir John Laking, who worked for Laking Sr. in his lumber business. One day, John set out on Drag Lake to a mill logging camp, never to return. To this day, no one knows why or how he disappeared.

A more recent [article][2] describes a rotting axe found by divers at the bottom of Drag Lake. Connection? Perhaps (or not).
