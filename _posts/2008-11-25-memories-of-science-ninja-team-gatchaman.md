Came across the art of [Phil Noto][2], who has made it to my list of top favourite illustrators. So reminiscent of Tatsuo Yoshida of *Gatchaman* and *Mach Go Go Go* fame. Classic.

Led me to the idea for my next tattoo: Jun [or Princess, if you watched it as *Battle of the Planets*] on my wrist. Yay!
