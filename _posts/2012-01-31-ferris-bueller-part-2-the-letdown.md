Or alternatively &#8220;How to damage 4 brands in 2 minutes&#8221;

I think I&#8217;m beginning to understand the outrage my parents felt when Bank of Montreal launched its re-branding as BMO using a Bob Dylan song.  The new Honda CRV commercial, which is a tribute to Ferris Bueller&#8217;s Day Off is debuting this weekend at the Super Bowl. It&#8217;s been leaked, and I couldn&#8217;t resist watching it.

When I first saw Ferris, I was 11, the movie had just come out in theaters and I was in love with it. It was funny, and rebellious, and poignant.  Most importantly though it was clever. This commercial is the exact opposite.



In the synopsis on the YouTube page the marketing copy is enthusiastic, and a bit disingenuous:

> Relive movie history with Honda&#8217;s fresh twist and wonderful homage to this &#8217;80s classic. Think you&#8217;re a true fan of Ferris Bueller&#8217;s Day Off? We hid over two dozen references to the movie throughout the commercial. Some are obvious, some are VERY subtle. See how many you can find.

Fresh twist? Not to nitpick but you&#8217;re copying a movie that&#8217;s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091042/" target="_blank">25 years old</a>, and your fresh spin on it is to put the now 50 year old star in a 2 minute remake (sorry tribute) minus the other cast, the well written dialogue, and the cool sports car? Your fresh twist is a bit of a let down.

The real risk might have been to show us Ferris Bueller at 50, did he marry Sloane? How&#8217;s Cameron doing? If the goal is to connect with your audience you&#8217;ve got to make them feel something, and sadly with all of the potential here, all I felt was bored.

What would you have done instead? Should we start a write-in campaign to Honda?
