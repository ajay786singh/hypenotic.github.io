In a couple of weeks, agronomists, food scientists, cheesemakers and cheesemongers will be joined by one *serious* cheese loving social marketing guy. On August 3rd, Barry will be delivering a presentation on social media at the [American Cheese Society Conference][1] in Montréal.

This is the conference&#8217;s 28th year, but it&#8217;s the first time the event is being held outside the U.S. That&#8217;s a nice nod to Montréal&#8217;s cheese making chops.

Montreal, cheese & social media&#8211;the perfect match for Barry who was born on the island, and raised by a Hungarian father who immigrated to Montréal and calls [Roquefort ][2]&#8220;The cheese of the kings and the king of cheeses&#8221; every time he serves up a cheese platter. Barry comes by his love of cheese naturally.
