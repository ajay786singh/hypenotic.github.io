<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2091" title="Screen shot 2010-03-22 at 11.03.43 AM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Screen-shot-2010-03-22-at-11.03.43-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2010-03-22 at 11.03.43 AM" width="224" height="179" />There&#8217;s an American food outpost in Paris called [Thanksgiving][1] where one can find all kinds of uniquely American processed  foodstuffs like Campbells Cream of Mushroom Soup and Goldfish crackers. An American journalist [recently documented][2] her visit to the store accompanied by two French neighbours who became  fascinated with all things American after watching [Julie and Julia.][3]

The experience left the journalists&#8217; French friends dumbfounded. At one critical moment the writer picks up a Turkey baster, an object heretofore unfamiliar to her friends, and she describes it as best she can. In response to her description, one friend responds: &#8220;*For this in France, a lady would use a spoon.&#8221;*

This got me thinking about how technology has made the food system and food itself worse instead of better and how folks are returning to low-tech foods&#8211;the produce aisle instead of all the stuff in boxes. Why use a turkey baster when a spoon would do just fine?

I&#8217;ve found that there are many places where low-tech solutions far outshine high-tech ones. Places where email and a universe social media sites have left many useful manual tasks behind with alot of negative side effects.

I was recently at [Inc. Magazine&#8217;s][4] [GrowCo Conference ][5]where CEO and author [Paul Spiegelman][6] talked about the importance of mailing hand-written notes to employees&#8217; homes. He writes notes to thank people, to express condolences, etc. He keeps a stack of them on his desk at all times.  Paul&#8217;s dedication to hand written notes reminded me of the benefits of keeping things low tech when trying dealing with valuable human interactions.

Below is my hit list of high-tech human engagement tools that I think are far inferior to their low tech counterparts.

*   **Facebook Birthday Alerts:** Remember when people used to call you on your birthday? You&#8217;d come home to a voicemail box full of warm messages. Or, even better, a few coloured envelope stuffed into your mailbox. No number of facebook notes can replace that warm feeling. I wish facebook birthday alerts would just go away. If you don&#8217;t know my birthday then don&#8217;t bother. If you remember my birthday, give me a call.
*   **Email Thank Yous: **In his [FED column, Corey Mintz][7] used to note whether his guests bothered to thank him and in what manner (email, phone call, note). Even though he didn&#8217;t come right out and say it, I got the feeling (and maybe I&#8217;m projecting) that email thank you&#8217;s are his least favourite way to receive expressions of gratitude. I know we&#8217;re all busy, but a personal thank you from a guest means the world. Someone cooked you a meal. Is a phone call too much to ask for?
*   **LinkedIn Invitations: **Nothing replaces meeting people face to face, having a glass of wine and breaking bread with them. Physically passing someone your business card with a smile will always be much more meaningful than hiding behind a computer monitor inviting people to join your list. LinkedIn has it&#8217;s place, but don&#8217;t ever mistake it as a substitute for going out and meeting people as a networking tool.
