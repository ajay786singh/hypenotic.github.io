The Barry [Beau&#8217;s Beer ][1]prototype has arrived! It was [way back in the spring][2] when Barry bid on and won the brilliant Beau&#8217;s auction item in support of one of our favourite organizations [Not Far From the Tree][3].

Now we&#8217;re so close we can feel it&#8230;.

This gorgeous prototype just hit the Beau&#8217;s Brewery production line. That means we&#8217;re just weeks away from being able to buy it in stores. The Barry Beau&#8217;s Beer bottles will be available for purchase at the LCBO starting in early November. Barry&#8217;s face will adorn bottles of [Lug Tread][4], [Night Marzen][5] and [Bog Water][6].

There will lots more fun announcements when we can get a mug of this mug, but in the meantime, have a look-see.
