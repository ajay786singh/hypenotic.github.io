  These posters are stapled to poles up and down Queen West&#8211;one of the most cluttered places in all of Toronto. Ads for cleaning ladies are literally layered with ads for club nights and promotions for films about the perils of climate change. Hard to get eyeballs.

  Or better yet, eyebrows. These ads for a shop specializing in eyebrow design are arresting and funny. The image works by  juxtaposing fashion photography with a scary, bushy unibrow.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The business behind the ads is <a href="http://eyelovebeautybar.com">Eye Love </a>a &#8220;brow and beauty bar&#8221; owned by Mary Dang. Mary was looking for a cost effective way to stand out, and she found it with the help of <a href="http://www.hermannaudrey.com/">Herman and Audrey</a>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  When our brows are unkempt we know we aren&#8217;t looking our best. The ad uses hyperbole to remind us what we might be looking like when things get a little Groucho Marx up there.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Reminds me of this Schick ad encouraging women to &#8220;mow the lawn&#8221; so all that&#8217;s left are &#8220;tulips on the mound.&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Enjoy, and go tidy up!  Unless you find this stuff offensive, in which case, tell me why.
