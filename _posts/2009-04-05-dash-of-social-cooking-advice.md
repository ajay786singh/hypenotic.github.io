Who says social media isn&#8217;t useful?  
This fun little script helps turn your limited larder into meal–either add twitter or use the site:

> &#8220;if you’re on Twitter, you can talk to Twecipe like this: “@twecipe broccoli, carrots, beef” and you’ll get a response like this: “Try Beef and Vegetable Pie http://twecipe.com/_kaw”. If you’re not on Twitter, you can use the site. And that’s it! A quick and handy way to get quick and handy recipes.&#8221;
