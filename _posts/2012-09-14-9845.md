I&#8217;m an avid and passionate thrift shopper. I&#8217;ve [written about it on this blog before][1] asking the question: &#8220;what is the magical mix of elements that makes thrifting such an exciting pastime?&#8221;

It&#8217;s not an easy question to answer. And it differs depending who you ask.

[Value Village][2] is working hard to splash its version of an answer all over town. They&#8217;re spending bucket-loads on print, TV and radio spots. But they haven&#8217;t figured it out. [Goodwill][3] is desperately trying to keep up by playing the &#8220;cool&#8221; card when it comes to re-using clothes, furniture, etc. They don&#8217;t have it nailed-down either.

The problem is they&#8217;re trying to talk to everyone at once&#8211;moms saving a buck on their kids&#8217; back to school clothes, grannies on a pension and the fashion-forward set. You can&#8217;t do that. Sorry.

You know who&#8217;s got it figured out?  [Macklemore and Ryan Lewis][4] do.  This mind-blowingly good music video is ostensibly a thrift anthem for those who *own* their funky thrift styles. And its aptly named Thrift Shop ([all the lyrics are here][5])



Because this video makes me want to run, not walk to my local thrift store, I think it&#8217;s worth highlighting why these guys *get *what is so irresistible about thrifting. And yes, I know it&#8217;s really not cool to quote rap like you&#8217;re writing a PhD thesis. For that I apologize in advance.

In short, it&#8217;s not that VV and Goodwill don&#8217;t have some of the same insights behind this video. Yes, in a creative brief written by an agency somewhere, VV knows that thrift appeals to:

*   The price conscious
*   The eco conscious
*   The fashion conscious

In fact on the Value Village (well, Savers, the US conglomerate that owns VV) website they say &#8220;we&#8217;re a place where people from all backgrounds love to shop for great selection, deals and treasures.&#8221; They say it, but they don&#8217;t say it *right* if they want to talk to a critical part of their audience&#8212;folks who wear their thrift clothes like a badge of honor.

Macklemore&#8217;s song is how you talk to people who rock their thrift with pride. Here&#8217;s how he does it. He says;

*   **You&#8217;ll find &#8220;fucking awesome&#8221; stuff: **It&#8217;s not &#8216;cool&#8217; or &#8216;great&#8217; stuff or &#8220;fun finds.&#8221; It&#8217;s **fucking awesome** stuff&#8211;ok? Macklemore says: &#8220;&#8217;bout to go and get some compliments passin off in those mocassins, someone else has been walkin in&#8221; Those used moccasins you found? They&#8217;re fucking awesome! Grandpa&#8217;s suit. It&#8217;s fucking awesome! I think that&#8217;s pretty clear.
*   **It&#8217;s a bargain (bitch): **He says &#8220;Savin my money and I&#8217;m hella happy that&#8217;s a bargain bitch ima take it grandpa style.&#8221; It&#8217;s not just that it&#8217;s more affordable, it&#8217;s that you can save money and own that grandpa style. Walking out of a store with a bag of (fucking) awesomeness when you had &#8220;$20 in my pocket&#8221; is where the magic lives.
*   **You&#8217;re Not a Sucka: **Macklemore spends time taking down the stupidity of spending money to line the pockets of big business. Macklemore is doing for fashion what the [Truth Campaign][6] did for tobacco; making you feel like a* fool* for handing your money to big business. VV can&#8217;t take this tact &#8217;cause they&#8217;re for a for- profit big business (and owned by Walmart). But *man* this would be a good strategy for Goodwill if they&#8217;d be willing to take a risk (they wouldn&#8217;t because of corporate sponsors). I smell an opportunity! Who wants it? Macklemore says:

> &#8220;They be like oh! That Gucci, that’s hella tight.I’m like Yo! That’s 50 dollars for a t-shirt. Limited edition, let’s do some simple addition, 50 dollars for a t-shirt, that’s just some ignorant bitch. I call that getting swindled and perished. I call that getting strict by a business.&#8221;

Interestingly, I stumbled[ upon this ad designed by a student][7] who was trying to come up with the right kind of messaging for Value Village. They get so much closer that any of those other playas.
