Georgeous work on display over at grain edit (mind-bending source of inspiration) by Czech illustrator Miroslav Sasek.

![This is the United Nations][1]

I&#8217;ve always wondered why school wasn&#8217;t composed of illustrated work and documentaries.

I remember the words to 1000s of songs and the relationships and histories of the band members. I can describe scenes and plots in intricate detail from hundreds of movies. Between grade 4 and university I devoured 50% of the sci-fi, fantasy, and espionage/adventure sections of my library. I can tell you the secret origin of hundreds of superheroes and recount countless plots from their pages. I&#8217;ve been stopped and informed by innumerable posters. I could go on, but the more I think it about it the angrier I get that texbooks and education in general suck as badly as they do.

Anyway, here&#8217;s a link to some books I&#8217;m going to find for my daughters:
