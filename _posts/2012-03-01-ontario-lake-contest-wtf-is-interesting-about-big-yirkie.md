I&#8217;m feeling like a big Jerkie. I&#8217;ve used every trick I have to find something (anything) interesting about Big Yirkie Lake near Bancroft Ontario and I&#8217;ve come up empty. So, this week I&#8217;m handing it over to you. Find something interesting about Big Yirkie Lake, put together a short paragraph and we&#8217;ll design a logo.

The winner gets a case of Beau&#8217;s (the one with Barry&#8217;s face on it) delivered to their door.

Contest ends Tuesday at Midnight.

Send all submissions to Jodi@hypenotic.com
