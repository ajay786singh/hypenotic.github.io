With the announcement today of <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/02/25/google-content-farms/" target="_blank">Google&#8217;s major algorithmic change</a> to its search engine we are, once again, back in the land where good content reigns supreme.  <a rel="attachment wp-att-4161" href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/4160/content-is-king-again/attachment/good-content"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4161" title="good-content" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/good-content.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="294" /></a>Like weeds in your garden, websites that have something useful to say and a story to tell have been suffering in page rank to *the others* that stuff, steal and copy content in order to &#8220;game&#8221; the system in the hopes of getting to that all elusive #1 Google search result.

It&#8217;s simple. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re writing content for a social media campaign, a blog post, a newsletter or website, if it ain&#8217;t quality don&#8217;t write it. If one of the worlds biggest companies is touting and investing in the importance of quality content, that should say something. Content is still King.

If Google gets it right, the ubiquitous &#8220;we&#8221; will spend less time searching and more time consuming quality.  It&#8217;s about time.
