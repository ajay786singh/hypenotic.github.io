Today, I saw someone wearing the once ubiquitous [Livestrong ][1]logo and began contemplating Lance Armstrong&#8217;s spectacular fall from grace. A fall so dramatic, [the UK newspaper that gave Armstrong a settlement][2] for &#8220;phoney&#8221; doping allegations is now turning around and suing him for all the settlement money back, plus interest, plus the costs incurred defending the case. It&#8217;s pretty humiliating stuff.

Now turn your mind to another stubborn refusal to accept responsibility. Today, [The New York Times][3] is reporting that documents from the Bangladeshi apparel factory where 112 people died by fire less than a month ago indicate that Walmart played&#8230;:

> &#8230;The lead role in blocking an effort to have global retailers pay more for apparel to help Bangladesh factories improve their electrical and fire safety.

<p itemprop="articleBody">
  According to the article, retrieved corporate minutes taken during meetings in 2011 show that Walmart&#8217;s Director of Ethical Sourcing concluded that improvements in fire and electrical safety in their 4500 Bangladesh factories would be a  “very extensive and costly modification&#8221; and that &#8220;it is not financially feasible for the brands to make such investments.” Kinda makes you wonder what the Director of Ethical Sourcing actually does with his time?
</p>

In its official corporate statement <a href="http://news.walmart.com/news-archive/2012/11/26/walmart-statement-on-fire-at-bangladesh-garment-factory" target="_blank">Walmart claimed</a> the fire was the result of a rogue supplier that acted &#8220;in direct violation of our policies.&#8221; Walmart attempted to scrub themselves clean of conspiracy but of course (as Armstrong found out) denial, denial and more denial cannot change a lie to the truth.

I could list a number of other examples of chronic deniers who arrogantly maintain innocence at their own peril. Anybody heard of Rob Ford?

The long and the short is that brands that fail to own up and take responsibility to fans, suppliers and citizens are being called to task and shamed for their lack of accountability.

Over my winter vacation I&#8217;ve been reading the latest edition of the classic coaching handbook [Coaching for Performance: Growing Human Potential and Performance][4]. Its author john Whitmore is an early pioneer in the coaching profession. The premise of Whitmore&#8217;s approach is that coaches don&#8217;t teach, tell or dictate–they empower others to make choices, take responsibility and have personal control over their decisions.

In the 4th edition of his book he dedicates a whole chapter to the current &#8220;crisis of meaning&#8221; ahead and what leaders need to do to address the &#8220;unsettling waves of change&#8221; evidenced by climate change, economic uncertainty and communities in crisis. Whitmore believes that it&#8217;s no coincidence that coaching has risen just in time to help us address the challenges ahead.

> Could it be that the coaching profession has emerged and grown so fast in only 25 years because it meets the broader need for self-responsibility, which, after all, is its principal product? Could the coaching profession have emerged to help midwife a new era?

Self-responsibility (and not phoney apologies) is emerging as a new normal. This leaves  brands like Rob Ford, Lance Armstrong and Walmart looking like stodgy old school power mongers and that&#8217;s just not attractive.

Brands try very hard to seem youthful, or at least currently relevant. No one willingly ascribes the personality &#8220;old man&#8221; to their brand (not even Depends). Walmart has Old Navy as competition. And even though Old Navy or Joe Fresh may not be any more ethical, it was Walmart that was called out and has so far reacted very badly. Walmart will bear the brunt of criticism, but these other brands had better take note. You can&#8217;t seem young, hip and fun if you&#8217;re acting like a stubborn, crusty, greedy grandpa.

Let&#8217;s hope that some of these greedy grandpas get the memo in 2013 and get themselves a coach and a healthy dose of self-responsibility.
