Every day at the mailbox bank at our office I dump a few pieces of junk mail into the blue-bin that Jeff, our kind Super leaves there for us.

I see the flavours of the day–gym offers, Dell brochures, crappy office-furniture, some take-out menus etc and think about their tactics.

I know that direct marketing is a numbers game. They hit enough people enough times and all the concepts, layouts, paper, printing and delivery costs eventually pay off when some sucker joins the gym. I get it it, intellectually.

But it occurred to me one day after a few years of following this ritual that there&#8217;s one metric the numbers geeks in direct mail probably missed.

What if every time I throw out my mail, in the infinite heartbeat it takes to float between my hand and the recycler, while I&#8217;m catching that eyeful of all the discarded direct pieces, I&#8217;m building a slight degree of aversion. Even a minuscule increment adds up eventually–Hypenotic has been around since &#8217;98.

I&#8217;m wondering if they measure reverse impressions. If it matters to them that, instead of chipping away, this tactic is eating away. What if repeatedly sending me mail I didn&#8217;t ask for after having procured my name from a list I didn&#8217;t sign up to is slowly but surely building a revulsion for these brands?

What if, instead of starting at neutral and coaxing me through a funnel that ends in sales, loyalty and evangelism, the opposite happens?

Does anyone know if the Direct Mail industry assesses whether their targets are not only not converting, but actively working against them, solely because of the repeated mail they send them?

Just wondering.
