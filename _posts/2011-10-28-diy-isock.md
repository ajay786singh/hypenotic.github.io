    I was eating brunch with a friend the other day when she pulled out her iPhone, covered in a cute little iPod sock. It almost looked like a toque (very fitting for the chilly weather we’ve been having); it was pretty adorable. So I decided my iPhone should look equally cute.

    I keep putting off buying a case or any kind of screen protector, so why not a sock? Off I went to the Apple online store to check out the <a href="http://store.apple.com/ca/product/M9720G/B">iPod socks</a>. I discovered that they come in packs of six, for $39 ($45 with shipping). This seems like a bit much when you consider, they’re just socks. And they’re not even full socks. Really, each one is like half a sock. Would you pay $45 for three socks? So then I thought: &#8220;I could make that.&#8221; So I did.

    I found a stripey sock with the heel worn out (which I would’ve thrown out soon anyway) and transformed it into my very own iSock.

    How to make an iSock:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    1. Find a sock (when in doubt, look at your feet, and you may very well find one there).<br /> 2. Cut off the top 4.5” or so (depending on the size of your iPhone or iPod, and just leave enough for a seam).<br /> 3. Turn inside out.<br /> 4. Sew the cut edge together.<br /> 5. Sew in the side of the sock so that it’s tight enough to hold onto your iPod or  phone without slipping off.
  </p>

    Et voilà, you have an iPod sock! It’s ridiculously simple, right? And definitely not worth $45. Sure, it doesn’t have a fancy little Apple tag on it, but it does the trick, and if you recycle an old sock it will cost you a grand total of $0.
