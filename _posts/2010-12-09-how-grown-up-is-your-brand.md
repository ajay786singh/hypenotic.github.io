I just turned Forty. To acknowledge the event I wanted my husband to buy me a &#8220;bauble&#8221;&#8211;a keepsake to mark the event. I ended up with a bold choice&#8211;what those in the know might call a  [&#8220;statement ring&#8221; ][1] from a great Queen Street boutique called[ Love of Mine.][2] I must tell you, I love the ring. I just love it.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-3882" href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/3881/how-grown-up-is-your-brand/attachment/screen-shot-2010-12-09-at-12-27-50-pm"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3882" title="Screen shot 2010-12-09 at 12.27.50 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screen-shot-2010-12-09-at-12.27.50-PM-250x250.png" alt="" width="250" height="250" /></a>

I&#8217;m not telling you this to brag (it was actually a relatively inexpensive purchase if you must know.) I&#8217;m telling you this because buying this ring made me think about another significant &#8220;bauble&#8221; &#8211;my engagement ring.

I never* loved* my engagement ring. I think it&#8217;s because when we bought it (8 long years ago), I wasn&#8217;t entirely sure who I was. I diverged from the obvious [Tiffany diamond solitaire][3] kind of ring, but truth be told, the ring I selected in the same general universe of other engagement rings.

Brands struggle with maturity issues all the time. I am going to go out on a limb and proclaim that you can determine a brand&#8217;s maturity level by considering how confident they are in their individuality and how they feel compelled to express it.<!--more-->

Brands that want to be different, but still use convention as a benchmark are what I call &#8220;thinking like a 30 year old.&#8221; As the engagement ring story indicates, at  30 I wanted to be my own woman, but I wasn&#8217;t sure how. As a result, I clung to certain stereotypes about how it was &#8220;supposed to be.&#8221; I may have accessorized conventionality, but I wasn&#8217;t ready to divert from the course.

I contend that brands that behave like 40 year olds are the ones that have the greatest staying power. Consider Volkswagon&#8217;s[ Think Small ][4]campaign from the 1950&#8242;s.  When everyone else was thinking big Volkswagon was willing to think small.  I would put the original [Absolut Vodka][5] ads in this camp&#8211;but I&#8217;d argue that they seem to be [growing less mature][6], not more.

There&#8217;s a difference between being confident and smart and being audacious just for the sake of being audacious. That type of approach is what I would consider the 20 year old approach&#8211;something very common in beer advertising and more recently in [Old Spice Ads][7] where using sex, irony, etc. is a tactic that gets attention, but to what end?

To me, the Old Spice ads are like 20 year olds who need to be just a bit too noisy to prove they &#8220;don&#8217;t give a shit?&#8221; Ok, gotcha, you don&#8217;t give a shit. Now please move away, I can&#8217;t hear myself think.

I think the best, recent example of  a 2o year old brand is the Spence Diamonds campaign polluting bus shelters all across the GTA. I&#8217;ll save that rant for another blog post (and it&#8217;s coming up&#8211;I promise you), but needless to say, they make a loud statement, but it&#8217;s one I just don&#8217;t *get.*

<a rel="attachment wp-att-3883" href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/3881/how-grown-up-is-your-brand/attachment/screen-shot-2010-12-09-at-1-49-07-pm"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3883" title="Screen shot 2010-12-09 at 1.49.07 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screen-shot-2010-12-09-at-1.49.07-PM-223x250.png" alt="" width="223" height="250" /></a>

So, now that I&#8217;m 40, I feel confident saying that the best brands behave like 40 year olds. Here&#8217;s some examples of  how they do it:

*   They don&#8217;t need to be LOUD to say something. They can say it quietly&#8211;and still be funny, intelligent, etc.
*   They are not original in order to buck tradition, they are original because it&#8217;s in their DNA.  In fact, they&#8217;re not even thinking about tradition. They don&#8217;t need to. They&#8217;re just doing what feels right and it pays dividends.

I&#8217;ve named a few, but I&#8217;m curious what brands *you* think qualify as  40 year old brands? What&#8217;s a 50, 60, 70 year old brand. I&#8217;d love to hear your opinion.

*Update: Just saw that Sociological Images got ahold of the Spence Diamonds ad and had a few choice words for their approach to single-dom. Check out their blog post here* http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2010/12/09/stigmatizing-single-people/
