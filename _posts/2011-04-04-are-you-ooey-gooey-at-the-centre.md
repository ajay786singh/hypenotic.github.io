We could all learn a lesson from chocolate-bar makers&#8211;what you put at the centre matters most.

The centre is where your mission lives.

A tactic is not a mission (&#8220;we&#8217;re an advocate&#8221; &#8220;we&#8217;re a festival&#8221; &#8220;we sell groceries&#8221;). If you put a tactic at the centre then you forget to ask why anyone else should care what you&#8217;re doing. Â You need to take stock and consider why you run a festival or sell groceries, and why does it matter to people other than the few who care because they work for you or they love you (like your mom).

If you put the ooey gooey goodness at the core then you attract the right kind of people who dig your particular flavour, texture and ingredients. Then you&#8217;re not in the chocolate bar business, and you can do things beyond make chocolate bars&#8211;as long as the other tactics you choose to do connect back to what&#8217;s at the core.

If [Hershey&#8217;s][1][][2] was really smart, York Peppermint Patty would be in the travel business. It&#8217;s all about that &#8220;sensation&#8221; right?
