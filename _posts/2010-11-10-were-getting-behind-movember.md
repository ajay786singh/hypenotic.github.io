<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3804" title="MovemberBadge_SJFB_small" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/MovemberBadge_SJFB_small.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="225" />November is one of those months that jumps on you when you&#8217;re not looking. It&#8217;s September&#8230;.and then *bam*, it&#8217;s November. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s taken us so long to get on the [Movember][1] train. We meant to do it last year, and the year before. But now we really are. In true Hypenotic fashion.

As Barry says on his [Movember profile page][2]:

> &#8220;Never doubt that a small cluster of facial hair can change the world&#8221;

Yes, we&#8217;ve arrived. And, just to let you know Hypenotic has gotten behind (yes, pun intended) Movember for several reasons;

*   Because its a bit ridiculous, and so are we
*   Because we&#8217;re a values based company, so what better way to demonstrate our values than to wear them on our faces?
*   Because we can, and will, make a whole lot of noise around this moustache business and help people better understand Prostate Cancer, and the organization Movember supports, [Prostate Cancer Canada][3]
*   Because we can help raise money for [Prostate Cancer Canada][3] who is committed to &#8220;elimination of the disease through research, education support and awareness.&#8221; Sounds good to us. Especially when 1 in 6 of all men will get it in their lifetime.

The stubbly faced fellas around Hypenotic had a few words to say about Movember, so let&#8217;s turn it over to Barry, Rick and Lionel.
