Full disclosure:  And now that I&#8217;ve spent a lot more time with Google+ and I&#8217;m digging a little deeper I do love it! Dang it Google, you got me again.  I think my iPhone looks a little nervous.

I like Google, I have four Gmail accounts.  I&#8217;ve played around with Google docs, and Google reader.  I love love love Google analytics. I find their tools useful, easy to understand and I like how clean their interfaces are. Playing with Android on my friend&#8217;s HTC phone gave me small pangs about iOS even though I am a rabid Apple fangirl. So where&#8217;s the but for me?

Google+

I&#8217;ve had an account for over a month now.  It should be something I love.  From people I know and trust to social superstars the buzz is extremely positive.  I have been regaled about the amazing hangouts friends have had.  How great it is having different circles (no more inappropriate over shares with family or bosses). It was invite only and I&#8217;m a sucker for an invite. There is easy access to the stars of tech and social.  I read at least two articles a day on how to get started, how to become a power user, all of the amazing chrome extensions  and why I need to be there.

But I have some concerns that keep me from falling in love:

1.  They want you to sign up with your real name and assign yourself a gender.  This isn&#8217;t a problem for me but it is for many people in my community.   Google&#8217;s response to the complaint? Tough pants.  Which leads me to the conclusion Google takes itself a little too seriously and isn&#8217;t listening to it&#8217;s potential user base.  Not a good start.
2.  Most of my favourite people aren&#8217;t there (yet).  I have several friends who don&#8217;t want to bother learning a whole new social network. I may be able to talk my Dad into it if he can do it on his iPad.  I&#8217;ve had debates with friends around making the leap, does it mean giving up Facebook and/or Twitter? (No and no, for the foreseeable future.)
3.  I keep being told how cool it is.  If you have to tell me this many times are you over selling it?

So what are your thoughts?  Are you using Google+ yet?  Have you fallen head over heels for the next great social network?
