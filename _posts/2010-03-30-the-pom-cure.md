Let&#8217;s face it, nowadays every product claims to contain antioxidants, phytonutrients or Omega3&#8242;s. Terms like those seem to [resonate with consumers][1], but it&#8217;s becoming pretty hard to stand out among all of these health claims.

That&#8217;s where POM&#8217;s advertising stands apart. They don&#8217;t just say their juice is good for you, they basically tell you it&#8217;s going to *save your life.*

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2137" title="Screen shot 2010-03-30 at 4.27.53 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Screen-shot-2010-03-30-at-4.27.53-PM-e1269985368728.png" alt="" width="410" height="235" />Apparently these ads were banned in UK for making health claims that research couldn&#8217;t support.

Sure, POM spent tons of money coming up with [research][2] to support all of the health benefits of pomegranate juice. But, I say anybody who thinks juice is going to save their life needs more help than antioxidants alone can provide.

Let&#8217;s put the issue pomegranate&#8217;s health benefits aside. The fact is, POM&#8217;s campaign is pure genius. The promise of cheating death bypasses all the fluffy stuff about being healthy and looking younger and cuts right to the chase. What&#8217;s all this health/youth stuff about anyway? At it&#8217;s core it&#8217;s about cheating death. It&#8217;s the elephant in the room that POM&#8217;s not afraid to talk about.

POM had the courage to say it like it is and stick its neck out. Even if they get their hand slapped, they are doing a great job of being themselves; bold, super-charged, unabashed and a bit saucy. Good on &#8216;em.
