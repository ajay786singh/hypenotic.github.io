Last week we put out the call for someone (anyone) to help us find something interesting about Big Kirkie Lake. We&#8217;ve selected our winner. David Kruger is a dedicated Beau&#8217;s Beer fan, so he took the time to put pen to paper in hopes of winning a case of [Beau&#8217;s beer with Barry&#8217;s face on it.][1]

Here is his winning submission which we based this week&#8217;s Big Yirkie Lake logo on. Congrats David.
