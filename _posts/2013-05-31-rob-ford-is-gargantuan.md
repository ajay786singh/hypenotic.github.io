Even if you have been living under a rock, if you live in Toronto, the aftermath of the allegations surrounding Rob Ford and crack cocaine will have burst into your life through some media outlet or another. And while the issue of our mayor using crack cocaine is huge, it is really just the cherry on top of a mountain of misconduct Rob Ford has accumulated since being elected mayor.

I know it&#8217;s a difficult mountain to wade through, especially with his massive form trying to hide it from the public (even you aren&#8217;t *that* big, Rob). In lieu of this, we&#8217;ve made an easy to read visual documenting some issues that Rob Ford has dropped the ball on:

Regardless of the controversy surrounding his use of crack cocaine, Ford has consistently shown a disregard for cultural diversity, minority groups, vulnerable people, the economy, the transit system, health care, honesty and integrity, and the law.  
Are you for Ford or for Toronto? Let&#8217;s face it, they&#8217;re mutually exclusive.
