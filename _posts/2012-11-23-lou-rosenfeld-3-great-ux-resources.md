> Lou Rosenfeld (<a title="Louis Rosenfeld on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/louisrosenfeld" target="_blank">@louisrosenfeld</a>) is best-known for being co-author of <a title="Amazon link to buy Information Architecture for the World Wide Web" href="http://www.amazon.com/Information-Architecture-World-Wide-Web/dp/0596527349" target="_blank">Information Architecture for the World Wide Web</a> (O&#8217;Reilly; 3rd edition, 2008), widely considered the &#8220;bible of information architecture&#8221;. But like a lot of information architects who get long in the tooth, he&#8217;s found himself advising his clients–mostly Fortune 500s–on the more strategic aspects of making information findable. Or, put another way, &#8220;information therapy&#8221;.

In anticipation of Lou&#8217;s upcoming 11/29 [workshop in Toronto][1] as part of our <a title="User Experience Design Workshops in Toronto" href="http://uxinto.ca/" target="_blank">UXinTO</a> partnership, I asked him for 3-5 great resources that openend his mind to new approaches to User Experience Design. Here&#8217;s his response:

### Christian Rohrer&#8217;s &#8220;User Research Landscape&#8221;

It may not be the prettiest <a href="http://www.xdstrategy.com/2008/10/28/desirability_studies/" target="_blank">diagram</a>, but it&#8217;s changed the way I think about user research, and I&#8217;ve been using it in almost every presentation and client meeting ever since I encountered it.  
Christian has pulled together much of the canon of user research methods, and charts them along two axes&#8211;qualitative/quantitative and behavioral/attitudinal.

<a href="http://hypenotic.com/design/10190/lou-rosenfeld-3-great-ux-resources/attachment/researchmethods3d1" rel="attachment wp-att-10192"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-10192" title="researchmethods3d1" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/researchmethods3d1-580x414.png" alt="Christian Rohrer's &quot;User Research Methods&quot;" width="580" height="414" /></a>

The result not only reminds us to focus on methods beyond our favorites, but we also can learn how (im)balanced our overall user research regimen is. In other words, if you&#8217;re using methods that are wholly of, say, the quantitative/behavioral quadrant, your insights will be quite biased and uneven.

### Gamestorming: A Playbook for Innovators

*by Dave Gray, Sunni Brown, & James Macanufo (O&#8217;Reilly, 2010)*

I hate meetings; that&#8217;s why I love <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gamestorming-Playbook-Innovators-Rulebreakers-Changemakers/dp/0596804172" target="_blank">this book</a>. It uses game-based exercises to make meetings not only tolerable, but productive and&#8211;get this&#8211;enjoyable. I&#8217;ve used many of its exercises when running client meetings; one of my favorites&#8211;the <a href="http://answers.oreilly.com/topic/1864-gamestorming-elevator-pitch/" target="_blank">elevator pitch exercise</a>&#8211;is available online for you to try out.

### @rosenfeldmedia Twitter Account

I know this sounds self-serving, but I curate tweets from the 63 UX experts associated with Rosenfeld Media&#8211;our authors, consultants, and board members&#8211;and retweet them from the @rosenfeldmedia account. Many of them are in turn retweeting posts from other great UX people. Between first and second-degrees of separation, that&#8217;s a lot of UX goodness I get exposed to via the process of curation.

If you want to keep up with any subject, become a curator; and if you want to keep up with UX, you can benefit from my curation by following the <a href="http://twitter.com/rosenfeldmedia" target="_blank">@rosenfeldmedia Twitter account</a>.
