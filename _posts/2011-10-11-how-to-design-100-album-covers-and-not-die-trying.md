This weekend I finished a personal project called <a href="http://angelykke.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">100 songs 100 designs</a> which I started back in April this year. The project was inspired by a workshop taught at the Yale School of Arts in which students had to choose one design exercise and repeat it for a hundred continuous days. I decided to take on the challenge designing an album cover for a new song each day.

**The rules:**

1.  Never having heard the song before
2.  Only use songs released in 2011
3.  Never repeat bands or artist
4.  Never spend more than a day on it: upload deadline 12 am

**Main Objectives:**

To gain a deep understanding of myself as a designer identifying my habits, common places, limitations and possibilities while discovering new music. To create enough content to pump up my design portfolio.

I also needed to generate some certainty for myself. When I started this I was working from home and had some freelance projects here and there but it wasn’t enough to keep me really entertained. The 100-album project became my everyday routine, the thing I would wake up in the mornings for.

If you ever want to try a challenge like this here’s some of the things I learned and I would recommend:

1.  **Be disciplined but flexible**  
    If the project becomes a burden to yourself or if it&#8217;s unrealistic it will be harder to finish. The first week I was very disciplined and worked on the covers from Monday to Sunday but found myself running back home from a bar at 11.30 pm on a Saturday night in order to design and upload the cover before the day ended. I managed to deliver in time but realized it was a good idea to have at least a day off. This is <a href="http://angelykke.tumblr.com/post/4485306358/mindkilla" target="_blank">the cover</a> I did in 15 minutes.
2.  **Be autobiographical**  
    Emotions, thoughts, frustrations and every day experiences are the best creative fuel and when you add music to the mix, ideas come flowing easy. <a href="http://angelykke.tumblr.com/post/4615417615/day11" target="_blank">This cover</a> happened right after being completely crushed in a job interview.
3.  ** Get inspired, reinterpret** A lot of times the album cover would be heavily influenced by from the song’s video, the official cover, a live performance or the lyrics. I also spent time looked at classic album covers from all eras either on the record store or in sites like <http://sleevage.com/>  But there are also external influences all the time; for example <a href="http://angelykke.tumblr.com/post/4642206850/day12" target="_blank">this cover</a> was designed after going to the movies to watch Scream 4. I was also still upset about the job interview from the previous day.
4.  **Build an archive **Take pictures of everything you find interesting (or lame), you never know when you’re going to use them. Most of the pictures I used for the album covers were taken by me over the past 4 years. My father also contributed considerably with an awesome photographical archive that he digitalized from family pictures from the 80s and 90s (the aesthetic is so good!). See if you can find my kindergarten picture turned album cover.
5.  **Find your limits and cross them**  
    I tried to do everything myself and to get away from the computer as much as possible so I experimented with watercolor, handwriting, crayons, collage etc. I would also write everything that crossed my mind while listening to the song before designing or sketching. Sometimes for a change of perspective I imagined stepping outside myself and pretending I was someone else, perhaps someone in another country or in a <a href="http://angelykke.tumblr.com/post/5534889745/day37" target="_blank">different time</a>.
6.  **Share your work!**  
    Don’t be afraid of being criticized, if you are creating content for yourself that’s super valuable. For me it was great to have a project that I felt passionate about because I had so much to say about it in interviews or in conversations. I opened a tumblr account, I tweeted about it every day, shared it on facebook and I’m even writing a blog about it right now!
7.  **One project will lead you to the next one**  
    We’re starting a new project here at Hypenotic called the <a href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/7027/introducing-the-ontario-lake-project" target="_blank">Ontario Lakes Project</a> in which I’ll be designing an identity for a lake every week, we’ll also be sharing some information about sustainability, travel and culture related to each lake. That will keep me going for a while.

As for the 100 songs 100 designs project I would like to continue, organize an exhibit, print a book and eventually get hired to design a real album cover. Anyone interested?

* *Thanks to everyone who followed the blog, sent me new great songs, great feedback, shared my work and encouraged me all through the way. You know who you are.*
