I&#8217;ve noticed a strange trend in scented products&#8211;the scent itself  actually bears no connection to its name.  [Febreze Air Effects ][1]has product names that are frankly off the hook. They range from the odd to the utterly absurd.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-2196" href="http://hypenotic.com/branding/2189/2189/attachment/screen-shot-2010-04-06-at-4-51-59-pm"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2196" title="Screen shot 2010-04-06 at 4.51.59 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-06-at-4.51.59-PM.png" alt="" width="199" height="139" /></a>They have one air freshener called [Lavender, Vanilla and Comfort][2].  Nestled beside the two other familiar &#8220;natural&#8221; scents (Lavender + Vanilla) one might think that the third is also a scent. *What exactly does comfort smell like? *Even worse is the one called [Linen + Sky][3]. *Sky?? *I can&#8217;t even begin to think about what the sky smells like? Is it different than the smell we currently call air? The same air this spray is supposed to freshen?

Today in the shower at the gym I used [Live Clean ][4] Body Wash that was in the shower. It was supposed to smell like [Fresh Water][5]. *Fresh water? *What would that smell like?* *Seaweed? The stuff that comes out of the tap? It turns out it smelled like the usual body soap you find at the gym&#8211; a generic perfume smell meant to deodorize my sweaty body.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-2197" href="http://hypenotic.com/branding/2189/2189/attachment/screen-shot-2010-04-06-at-4-51-12-pm"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2197" title="Screen shot 2010-04-06 at 4.51.12 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-06-at-4.51.12-PM.png" alt="" width="165" height="195" /></a>It is ironic that at a time when the sky is stinky and polluted, and the water is anything but fresh, we&#8217;re being bombarded by smells that represent a longing for a kind of paradise lost. Doubly ironic is the fact that these air &#8220;fresheners&#8221; are putting toxins into the air in your home. In other words, the same stuff that makes the air and water polluted is intended to smell like something pure and natural.

On a whole other level are Febreze&#8217;s  &#8216;exotic&#8217; scents. I can almost live with scent names like the soon to be released [Thai Dragon fruit][6] (&#8220;inspired by the winding canals of Thailand&#8221;), even though I&#8217;ve been to Thailand, and can&#8217;t recall that smell as a particularly pleasant one.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-2198" href="http://hypenotic.com/branding/2189/2189/attachment/screen-shot-2010-04-06-at-4-47-55-pm"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2198" title="Screen shot 2010-04-06 at 4.47.55 PM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-06-at-4.47.55-PM.png" alt="" width="180" height="151" /></a>But then (and brace yourself) consider whether you would like your house to smell like a [Brazilian Carnaval][7],  or worse, a [Moroccan Bazaar.][8] Can you imagine your house smelling like a Moroccan Bazaar? What would people think if your home smelled like a combination of camel, cigarettes, sweaty men and old wool?

As the world supposedly gets smaller and we become one big happy global village (now I&#8217;m wondering what would a global village smell like?) buying nick-nacks at [Ten Thousand Villages][9] and listening to world music, I guess we want to indulge in world smells. We don&#8217;t actually want to go to those places and meet those exotic people, we just want to smell pretend smells that are pretending to smell like them.

Given the popularity of these exotic smells, I&#8217;ve come up with my own list that I&#8217;m planning to send to the folks at P&G:

*   Parkdale Alley
*   S & M Dungeon (Smell the Fear)
*   Farmer&#8217;s daughter
*   Thrift Shop
*   Yurt
*   Shore Leave

Any of your own to add to the list? I&#8217;d love to send them along.
