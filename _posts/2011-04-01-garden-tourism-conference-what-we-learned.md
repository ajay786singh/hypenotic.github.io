Gardening tourism. When I told people that I was going to a [Gardening Tourism Conference][1], their reaction was always the same &#8220;Gardening Tourism. What&#8217;s that?&#8221; I had an inkling, but I wasn&#8217;t sure myself.

Truth is I didn&#8217;t think of myself as a gardening tourist. But the conference reminded me of all of the garden experience I&#8217;ve engaged in&#8211;both locally and when travelling. I go to High Park when the [cherry blossoms are in bloom][2]; I touredÂ [orchid growing areas in Thailand][3]; And my kids and I visit [Butterfly World][4][][5] in Del Ray Florida when we head to see my folks every winter.

So, while gardens might seem rather niche, they are a real draw. [The Travel Activities and Motivation Survey ][5] found that visits to gardens are one of the top things affluent seniors want to see when they travel. But, it&#8217;s not just seniors visiting gardens. And, gardens are engaging in some very innovative programming to get people to visit regularly.

One of the real appeals of gardens is that they get you out of &#8220;buying stuff&#8221; mode that so often happens on vacation (even though this may not be what gardening sites with gift shops want to hear) and the money I am spending (on entry fee) is on a social good&#8211;more gardens means more beauty, cleaner air, protection of species, etc. It&#8217;s a win/win. It&#8217;s an authentic experience that is educational and soul enriching.

The conference speakers included a number of luminaries in the field including Pascal Garbe, Director of the European Gardens & Tourism conference, [Alan Jolliffe][6] from Christchurch New Zealand, Karen Daubmann from[ New York Botanical Garden][7] in New York, and our own[ Barry Martin][8] who presented how the power of social media can be used to increase and broaden the market for garden tourism.

It was an interesting event, so we thought we&#8217;d share some of our learnings with you
