At least half of our clients process an amazing amount of interesting data in the course of doing what they see as their main job: Making change.

We&#8217;re often able to convince them to turn bits of their learning into by-products that can do triple duty as marketing and a way to keep people informed about what they&#8217;re up to.

This poster does a great job of breaking down a task that might be daunting to address as a whole into chewable parts. Usability and productivity experts will agree that breaking down tasks into their most easily actionable components gives them a much better shot of getting done.

The illustration style and written language are warm and inviting, further disarming apprehension about a new task.

The site that put it together uses these shareable and shareworthy pieces of content as marketing. If you can get your head around the idea, the keys are:

*   Solve a problem for people so that searchers find it and people that create resources want to share it with their audiences
*   Do a professional job of it (solid facts, smart copy and beautiful aesthetics) so people want to look at it and share it
*   Reach out to people and places that might want to share it with you
*   Include a link to the actual image that brings traffic back to your site
*   Have a page on your site ready to receive them
*   Cite your sources
