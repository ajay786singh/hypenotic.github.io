This animation set to a talk by philosopher [Alan Watts][1]Â will remind you of the purpose of your life. It&#8217;s a big idea put very simply by a compelling thinker set to some good animation.

Is there any better line than &#8220;It was a musical thing. You were supposed to sing or dance while the music was being played.&#8221;

Watch, enjoy and reflect!
