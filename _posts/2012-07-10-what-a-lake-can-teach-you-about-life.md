  We&#8217;re 32 weeks into the <a href="http://hypenotic.com/browsing/ontario-lakes-project">Ontario Lakes Project</a> and we&#8217;ve only just launched into the letter &#8216;C&#8217; (which used to be for Cookie, but last week was for <a href="http://hypenotic.com/fun-stuff/9466/9466">Canoe lake</a>). We still have a long way to go.  as we work our way through the entire alphabetical list of Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lakes_of_Ontario">List of Lakes of Ontario</a>,  we thought it was worth talking a pause and reflecting on the  valuable lessons we&#8217;ve learned so far:
</p>

&nbsp;

**1. Focus Breeds Discipline: **

****All of us at Hypenotic are supposed to be blogging on a regular basis, but in the midst of pressing client timelines blogging often falls by the wayside. I&#8217;m sure you know the feeling.

With the exception of very few weeks, we&#8217;ve kept this Ontario Lakes Project thing up. Why? Because we made a commitment to a focused idea. Every week I go to my [List of Lakes][1], see which one&#8217;s next and dig into my research. As a result, much of the initial thinking/wondering &#8220;what should I write about?&#8221; is out of the equation. What&#8217;s the take away? That we&#8217;d all be better off if we planned out blog topics in advance. It&#8217;s a big challenge but tools like [Divvy][2] exist for the sole purpose of taking the guesswork out of blogging. I can attest that this approach works.

**2. Collaboration is Awesome:**

Each of the Ontario Lakes is a collaborative effort between myself and one of our talented graphic designers (to date Chris and Angelica have run the show). I write the content and without any direction, one of them designs what strikes them as the most intriguing or interesting aspect of that lake&#8217;s story. Sometimes it&#8217;s just as I imagined ([Crappie Fishing at Cameron Lake][3] pretty much drew itself) and sometimes I&#8217;m entirely surprised (The Mink Milk one for [Birch Lake][4] wasn&#8217;t what I was expecting). But this cool collaboration keeps it interesting.

**3. Be Willing to Change Course**

If you look back at [Lake Abitibi][5], the first lake we featured, it was pretty straight-ahead in terms of focus. A little about the lake&#8217;s name but nothing too snazzy. We figured out that we&#8217;d all get bored fast if we didn&#8217;t find a way to find more interesting content. By [Lake Ahmic we hit on a bit about swimmer Marty Sinn][6] and we were hooked on a whole new way of approaching content. Pardon the pun, but we decided to &#8220;look for the hook.&#8221; Each lake needed an interesting narrative, and our job was to find it. We&#8217;ve been doing that ever since.

**4. Be Relentless and Curious**

No offense, but some Lakes don&#8217;t offer much in the content department. I am forever grateful to [Phil the Forecaster][7] for painting Canonto Lake, otherwise I would have skipped it all together and hope no one noticed. Here are a few tricks for unburying hidden content:

*   Add the word &#8220;famous&#8221; before a term you&#8217;re googling&#8211;that&#8217;s how I found the one about [Lake Baptiste][8].  Also, words like &#8220;weird,&#8221; &#8220;news&#8221; &#8220;funny&#8221; used in conjunction with your search term yields interesting results
*   Check out what&#8217;s on[ YouTube][9] (the world&#8217;s second largest search engine), and don&#8217;t forget [Vimeo][10] (if youtube is about quantity, then Vimeo is about quality).
*   Get Local. Local papers are great for providing on the ground insight. After all, a Cottage Associations have their ear to the ground.  There&#8217;s no better place to find knowledge than within a group of people so invested in a place , issue or idea they&#8217;re willing to write about it.

  <strong>5. When lakes give you lemons, make Lakeaid</strong>

  <a href="http://hypenotic.com/ontario-lakes-project/8756/contest-winner-big-yirkie-lake-ontario-lakes-project">Big Yirkie Lake</a> had us stumped. There seemed to be nothing interesting about that particular body of water. So, we put out a call to our community, asking them to come up with something (anything) interesting about Big Yirkie, and the contest winner, David Kruger, got a case of beer for his trouble. We in turn got an idea for a logo that rocked it.

  Stay tuned for more lakes, and if you have one that you&#8217;re particularly passionate about tell us and we&#8217;ll let you guide the process.
