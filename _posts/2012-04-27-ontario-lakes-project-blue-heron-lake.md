During the winter of 2004-2005, the famous Blue Heron Lake snapping turtle, with a huge shell measuring over 5 feet passed away due to natural causes. He was one of the lucky ones.

[According to a recent report][1], hunting, highway roadkill and habitat loss are threatening the snapping turtle species. A coalition has been formed calling for an end to snapping turtle hunting  for their turtle meat which is (apparently) sold on the black market. One of the organizations behind the report says

> “While we must find long-term solutions to deal with these threats, the province has the power to give snappers a fighting chance today by ending the hunt.”

   The prehistoric creatures continue to live in Blue Heron Lake despite ongoing threats. Recently, there has been a sighting of another enormous snapping turtle&#8211;this one with a much smaller shell, measuring a measly 3 feet.
