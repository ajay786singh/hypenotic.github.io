Hello, hello! My name is Collin Henderson, and I&#8217;m a computer programming student at Niagara College, interning at Hypenotic. I specialize in web design, user experiences, and front-end development. After my internship here, I have one more semester of school before I graduate with a Computer Programmer Analyst diploma.

I&#8217;ve always been enamoured with all things on the web. I&#8217;ve been designing and developing websites for around five years now, and am always keen to learn the new and emerging technologies that come with it. During my days here at Hypenotic, I&#8217;m usually kept busy with a variety of work such as tweaking WordPress themes, developing responsive solutions for web pages, and trying to get the office puppy Blue, to like me. During evenings and weekends, I like to hack away at a plethora of different projects using fun tech like PHP, MySQL, Node.js, Socket.io, Objective-C, etc. I also love to play volleyball, and enjoy composing music of all sorts.

I look forward to continuing to work with this great team, here at Hypenotic. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll learn a ton while I&#8217;m here, and hopefully have the opportunity to share some of my own skills with others.
