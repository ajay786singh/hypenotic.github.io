Sounds like a very strange Italian pasta dish you might get on the kids&#8217; menu at Olive Garden.  But according to the [Haliburton Echo][1], it is the name of an eight month old hound puppy who went missing near Haliburton&#8217;s Black Lake.

The puppy was the subject of a long and arduous community-wide search that included Black Lake and surrounding area. When two weeks past, Monkey&#8217;s owner Phil and friends were certain Monkey was doomed. But on December 5, 2007, 18 long days after Monkey had disappeared news that the puppy had been found came over the Citizens Band radio.

A trail groomer had found Monkey and lured him home with his trailer and &#8220;a few pepperettes&#8221;

The dog was eight pounds lighter and afraid of humans. But after being returned to his owner was immediately on the mend.

Monkey&#8217;s owner put it this way:

> Too often one does not get a second chance with those they lose. If a small, starved puppy can manage a kiss, I’m sure we all can do much more than that for those we love.
