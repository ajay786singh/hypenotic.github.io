title: The Blessing of a Lost Makeup Bag
author: Jodi Lastman
excerpt: Turns out losing my makeup bag was it good thing. It forced me to rethink my use of toxin laden makeup and replace it with much more eco-friendly, health-fiendly products. I think I like it already.

First the fixture in our bathroom broke and we were down to one bulb making it hard to see my skin up close. Then, I lost my makeup bag&#8211;just one of the hazards of lugging it back and forth from my spinning class.

So, I went a week without makeup or hair product. I apologize if you were one of the people who saw me during that week-long period. I wasn&#8217;t looking my best.

Truth is I couldn&#8217;t live without my [Kynk  Hair Honey][1], a fabulous all natural product that doesn&#8217;t irritate my already super sensitive scalp with alcohol. I&#8217;ve only ever seen Hair Honey at [The Big Carrot][2], so off I went to replace it.

And,  while at The Big Carrot, with my hubby and kids waiting in the car, I made the monumental, spontaneous decision to shift to all chemical free cosmetics. In addition to the Hair Honey, I  bought two things:

1.  [Earthlab Cosmetics Raw Mascara ][3]and
2.  [100 Percent Pure Pink Grapefruit Glow for Lips and Cheeks][4]

I&#8217;m now determined to whittle my formerly overstuffed makeup bag down to 5 items max (blush, mascara, lipstick, tinted moisturizer and eyeliner).  And, I want all of those things to be friendly to my body and to the earth. As the saying goes &#8220;what goes on goes in&#8221; and I want what goes in to not mess with my health.

This is a radical step for me. The last remaining &#8220;conventional&#8221; makeup item in my possession is my [Dermalogica Sheer Tint Moisture][5]&#8211;salvaged by the fact that it had fallen out of my makeup bag before I schlepped it to the gym that fateful day. A little peak at [The Environmental Working Group&#8217;s Skin Deep database ][6]revealed that my trusted Moisturizer is [rated a 3 out of 10][7] on their hazard scale&#8211;a moderate hazard.

Moderate hazard? Is it worth the risk?

I grew up with a mom who had a vanity table with a big mirror with lights all around it. I felt totally glamorous looking in that mirror. I think I probably spent hours staring at my reflection.  And the drawers of that Hollywood vanity table were full of neatly organized fancy makeup containers that were incredibly alluring to me&#8211;even at an early age.

My &#8216;bubby&#8217; (Jewish grandmother) was proud to declare that she never left home without her makeup. I&#8217;ve always kinda been the same. People don&#8217;t think of me as the &#8220;makeup type&#8221; because the makeup itself is barely detectable on my face. It&#8217;s more the gesture, the idea of makeup I guess that makes me feel &#8220;put together.&#8221;  
But, I promise, I&#8217;m always wearing mascara and tinted moisturizer if not more.

That is until I lost my makeup bag.

So, giving  up conventional makeup isn&#8217;t easy for me. There&#8217;s quite a bit of marketing baggage that has helped convince me that the familiar store-bought makeup is fun and makes me look pretty. In fact, when I got into the car today and unwrapped my new cheek and lip glow, eager to try it on for size, my husband (with whom I have 2 daughters) said &#8220;Just like one of the girls.&#8221;

And he was right. But this time there was a difference. I finally decided to infuse my enjoyment of cosmetics with my own personal values. I&#8217;m venturing to say that it won&#8217;t  make me enjoy it less, or feel less pampered, pretty, etc. In fact, I&#8217;m already looking forward to my next trip to The Big Carrot for some tinted moisturizer and an eyeliner.

If you see me around, tell me what you think.
