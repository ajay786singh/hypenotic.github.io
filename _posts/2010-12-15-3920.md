The fantastic people who came toÂ [The Great Canadian Moustache Party][1] at [Mildred&#8217;s Temple Kitchen][2] to celebrate Movember, didn&#8217;t just look good, they sounded good.

Each person had their own bit of wisdom to share about the experience of growing a moustache or watching others grow theirs. And now, we share their wisdom with you.

What did Movember teach you? Check out our [entire Movember playlist][3] for more wisdom from the evening

#1. You gotta know who to take home + who to &#8220;kick out in the morning&#8221;



#2. The girl-stache is utterly irresistible



#3. You gotta go big, or go home



#4. It&#8217;s all about grooming



#5. Our dads knew how to do it



#6. Sometimes you have to suffer to be noble  


#7. For the love of G-d, invest in a decent razor  


#8. No one can resist a man with a moustache
