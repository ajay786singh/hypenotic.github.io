Last week I was invited to participate in the inaugural [Doors Wide Open][1], an event that was all about getting young up and comers out to interview mentors who have turned their passions into careers.

The organizers called  it: &#8220;speed dating meets career fair.&#8221;  I call it &#8220;career day on speed.&#8221;

I sat down with six different folks throughout the night. While each of them had different questions and experiences I walked away with a very clear sense of some of the myths/perceptions about how careers work that might be holding some of them back.

Here are the key take-aways I hope I left them with:

1.  **Please (please) do not send your resume by email (and expect anyone to care.)** As the person on the other side of the computer I can tell you that all resumes start to look alike. You gotta work it girlfriend. Network your ass off to find people to talk to, take to coffee or lunch to meet who you need to meet to get the job you want. If I meet someone great, I&#8217;ll figure out how to help them.
2.  **Accept that the beginning is meant to be confusing.** People beat themselves up feeling like they should have it all &#8220;figured out by now&#8221;. The fact is there&#8217;s a decade called your 20&#8242;s that is custom made for trying some stuff out. Go have some fun and release the pressure valve and you&#8217;ll learn what you need to know (I feel like a Jedi Warrior right now). If you trust me your life will be much better. Trust me.
3.  **Love Your Networks: ** If you want to meet someone in the advertising field, start by going to facebook and typing &#8220;does anyone know someone in advertising? If so, can you connect me? I&#8217;m looking for a job.&#8221; See what happens. If someone asks you to lend them a hand, do the same (it&#8217;s called Karma.)
4.  **Give it Away Now.** If you can find a way to afford it, I suggest working for free. We&#8217;ve hired three people who were former interns, and all have been amazing. None had to wait too long before they got some kind of remuneration. If you&#8217;re working hard and remuneration&#8217;s not forthcoming move on, but it&#8217;s worth a shot.
5.  **Don&#8217;t Wait. Do Something. **I met a lovely woman who is interested in revitalizing community spaces. She was looking for a job in the field and having a bit of a struggle. My advice?  Go revitalize some community spaces! There are parks, community gardens, seniors&#8217; centres all around her community that could use her passion, skills and expertise. Then she&#8217;d have something to show for her work. A blog is nice, but a garden&#8211; better.
