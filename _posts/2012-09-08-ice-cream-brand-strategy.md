There are four ice-cream shops within walking distance of my house. They all sell good ice-cream from brands with a care for craft.

I&#8217;ll walk by the two closest ones every time.

And I&#8217;ll tell everyone who asks and a bunch of people who don&#8217;t ask, to go to these spots too.

The loyalty these companies inspire costs them nothing. So how do they get it in this jaded mass media era?

They don&#8217;t give me friction when I ask for two flavours of the same size.

I&#8217;ve been going to the [White Squirrel][1] (on Queen West across from Trinity Bellwoods park) for years. No matter how hectic it gets with sweaty hipsters lined up out the door and kids, families and dogs clogging the sidewalk with park-gear and bikes, the folks there always seem cool under fire. They&#8217;re game to let you taste flavours, don&#8217;t rush you and, of course, let you mix 2 flavours in your scoop.

My new find, [the ARROW][2], On Dundas near Ossington serves [Mapleton&#8217;s][3]. In a visit last weekend, my youngest daughter licked half her scoop onto the floor. They gave her an entirely new cone. I was going to use her remaining half cone and have them dump another scoop on mine, but they wouldn&#8217;t have it–they made me a full cone on top her remaining half cone.

I don&#8217;t think they process this strategically, but here&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening:

Ice cream may be a commodity game, where the retailers aren&#8217;t making huge margins on the already expensive premium ice-cream. But these businesses put solid people on the front line and empower them to focus on helping the customers experience awesomeness.

Maybe awesomeness sounds like too big of an idea for an ice cream shop, but the point is that they&#8217;re looking for opportunities to make the experience noteworthy and memorable. And frankly, the pervasive lack of this consideration at other places makes their effort stand out all the more starkly.

Have you considered whether your touch-points offer memorable experiences? Turns out there&#8217;s a pretty fine line between being irrelevant and being championed by your customer (constituents, clients, etc).
