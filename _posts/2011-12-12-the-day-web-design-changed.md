I have a headache. And I know why. It&#8217;s from looking at too much (on screen) small type. And straining.

Of course I&#8217;m responsible for putting plenty of it out there over the years, but now I&#8217;m 40, I need reading glasses, and I empathize with everyone who has been peering down their nose through bifocals at our website.  
In 2012, I&#8217;m going to set type bigger. Then I&#8217;m going to look at our metrics and see what impact it has on our readership. I&#8217;ll let you know. But in the meantime, you might want to to consider whether the experience you&#8217;re giving your readers includes a headache.
