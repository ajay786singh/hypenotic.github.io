I always thought [Second Harvest&#8217;s Lunch Money Day ][1]was a great idea. It&#8217;s one of those great fundraising ideas the involve asking folks to do something they would normally do&#8211;but to do it differently for a great cause.

Fact is, the average person in Toronto spends at least $5 on lunch every day. For most of us it&#8217;s a convenience we take for granted. So, for one day we manage without the convenience of a bought lunch and divert resources to Toronto&#8217;s hungry. If you think brown bagging it is inconvenient, just think about eating baked potatoes for two weeks. That&#8217;s just one story out of the just released [Recession Relief Coalition report. ][2]

So, on Lunch Money day myself and my companion Agata hit the subway platform Â to round up some fundraising dollars and drum up some awareness. I was there with several other eager volunteers who woke up much too early to make a difference. Here&#8217;s a short video about our experience that day.
