<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/juliemarie1/3295577996/" target="_blank">Agnew Lake</a> is located just outside of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudbury_Ontario" target="_blank">Sudbury, ON</a>.  It was created completely by accident in the early 1920&#8242;s when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INCO" target="_blank">INCO</a> (International Nickel Company of Canada) put a power dam into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_River_(Ontario)" target="_blank">Spanish River</a>.  This caused the river to flood and form Agnew Lake. It is named after <a href="http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=a1ARTA0000060" target="_blank">John Lyons Agnew</a> who was the President of the company at the time.

The area around the lake supported 5 diamond mines until the mid-1980&#8242;s; even though originally the area was to be mined for uranium. Uranium mining didn&#8217;t start until the late 70&#8242;s.

Agnew Lake is an excellent fishing lake which supports healthy populations of Smallmouth Bass, Channel Catfish, Northern Pike, Walleye, Whitefish and Perch.
