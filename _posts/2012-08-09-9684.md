It&#8217;s near impossible to relax when you&#8217;re under attack. But parents are facing just this challenge. This summer there have been a plethora of articles telling parents they need to &#8216;chill&#8217; at the same time that they&#8217;re being told that, frankly, they are doing a shitty job. So shitty a job, in fact, that their kids are the most screwed up in generations.

The New Yorker started the ball rolling with asking [&#8220;Why Are American Kids so Spoiled?&#8221;][1] And the answer is:

> “with the exception of the imperial offspring of the Ming dynasty and the dauphins of pre-Revolutionary France, contemporary American kids may represent the most indulged young people in the history of the world.”

The Globe and Mail has been wielding a similar sword, swinging like crazy at parents&#8217; jugulars while again, telling them their far too uptight. The Globe asked [Are Our Pampered Kids Under Too Much Pressure?][2] and also offered advice about [Why Parents Should Add &#8220;Relax&#8221; To Their To Do List.][3]

In light on all this, this Johnson and Johnson ad is spot on. In classical advertising terms it exploits a truth. This truth has nothing to do with J & J&#8217;s products, but the fact that this little message is brought to you by a major corporation that sells toxic soap (among [a litany of other horrors to mothers and babes][4]) is of course more than a little sad.

It goes to show you the state of affairs for parents who are being consistently told they&#8217;re doing it all wrong. I can&#8217;t help crying every time I hear &#8220;you&#8217;re not perfect&#8230;.but you&#8217;re trying.&#8221;  I&#8217;m glad someone, even an evil empire, is recognizing my parenting chops.
