In the 1960&#8242;s Lake Erie was known as “North America’s Dead Sea.&#8221; Then it became an environmental success story. And now it&#8217;s in trouble again.

In a recent [New York Times article,][2] an environmental scientist said:

“We’ve seen this lake go from the poster child for pollution problems to the best example in the world of ecosystem recovery. Now it’s headed back again.&#8221;

A harbour master at Erieau, a sleepy cottage town of Port Glasgow reported bumping into a “sea of algae” that he could smell before he saw it.

A visitor to Wheatly Ontario stopped to capture the green water , repeating the refrain &#8220;that water is green, pea soup green.&#8221; Indeed it is.
