This painting of Lake Canonto entitled &#8220;Canonto Lifted Condensati<wbr>on Level&#8221; was created by an artist who goes by the moniker [Phil the Forecaster. ][1]Trained at Queen&#8217;s University as a nuclear physicist, &#8220;Phil the Forecaster&#8221; has been a professional meteorologist since 1976. That would explain why he paints clouds so well.</wbr>

I&#8217;ve often come across people who have two distinct passions, but few seem to be able to have their passions coexist as harmoniously as Phil the Forecaster, who blends meteorology and painting with such lovely results.

Check out Phil the Forecaster&#8217;s blog post and painting [Summer Clouds ][2]which reads:

> The cumulus clouds were developing early under the strong, late spring sun. It had rained hard overnight and there was moisture everywhere.

We could all aspire to bring our passions together as well as Phil the Forecaster, who brought poetry to the Condensation that was hanging around Lake Canonto.
