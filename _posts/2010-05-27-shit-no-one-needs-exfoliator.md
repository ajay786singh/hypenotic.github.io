The articles in this series will highlight the consumer products and services that serve no real purpose to anyone. Other agencies market that kind of stuff really, really well. So well, they&#8217;ve helped convince lots of people to buy shit they don&#8217;t need. We [choose to work with values based companies][1] who do things people actually care about.

Years ago, Seth Godin wrote a blog post that spelled it out in his usual succinct manner:

> If you&#8217;re a good marketer (or even worse, a great marketer), it means that you&#8217;re responsible for what you sell. When you choose to sell it, more of it gets sold.

We don&#8217;t choose to sell shit no one needs. We choose to talk about the stuff that gets sold that should not. So here goes&#8230;

No one needs exfoliator. They don&#8217;t need the kind made out of organic ingredients (that still has lots of unfriendly packaging) and they don&#8217;t need the kind with tiny beads made from big long chemical words no one can pronounce. Many of those complicated multi-sylabic words cause cancer and other unfun diseases. Check the [Environmental Working Group][2]&#8216;s Skin Deep Database for a listing of all the wonderful [ingredients in exfoliants ][3]and other cosmetics.

Want to get rid of dead skin cells on your face + body. Here are simple instructions.

1.  Step out of shower
2.  Grab towel
3.  Rub towel vigorously over face and body
4.  Repeat

Don&#8217;t believe me? [Read this.][4] Don&#8217;t go and buy an exfoliating towel. That&#8217;s just redundant. Just use your plain old bath towel, and rub it around. You&#8217;ll feel glorious.

For an alternative perspective, watch this [terrific video][5] on exfoliation that encourages you to scrub your face with chemical beads before smearing petroleum jelly all over your face.
