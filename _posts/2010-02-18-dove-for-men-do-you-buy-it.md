<img class="size-full wp-image-2023 alignright" title="Screen shot 2010-02-18 at 10.56.41 AM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Screen-shot-2010-02-18-at-10.56.41-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2010-02-18 at 10.56.41 AM" width="265" height="195" />Dove has launched a [new men&#8217;s line][1]. Like [Dove&#8217;s Real Beauty campaign][2], Dove&#8217;s male targeted campaign seeks to challenge gender stereotypes&#8211;this time taking on the external beauty pressures men face. [Unilever][3] did the research and shared some interesting findings about male gender identity, including (from the [Toronto Star][4])

*   80 per cent of men in Canada believe they are falsely portrayed in the media – that the washboard abs, bulging pecs and ripped biceps so often featured in television and print ads do not reflect their pale, doughy reality.
*   <span style="line-height: 21px;">Men reject advertising that portrays the ideal man as rich, implausibly handsome and aggressively ambitious&#8211; real men are more inclined to value their personality and sense of humour over money and possessions.</span>

<span style="line-height: 21px;">To combat these stereotypes Dove created a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuexzKkMIDc">big, splashy ad </a> called The Road to Comfort that launched during the Superbowl. It&#8217;s a good spot targeted to men who are <em>at the stage of life </em>where they are literally and figuratively comfortable in their own skin and want to abandon traditional ideas of male identity and embrace who they really are. The men&#8217;s care products are targeted to men who are ok using male targeted cosmetic brands.</span>

<span style="line-height: 21px;"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2016" title="Screen shot 2010-02-18 at 10.44.34 AM" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Screen-shot-2010-02-18-at-10.44.34-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2010-02-18 at 10.44.34 AM" width="192" height="149" />I&#8217;m not the first to notice that Unilever, the same company who owns Dove, also owns Axe; the brand famous for promoting the Axe effect. Not sure what the Axe Effect is? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9tWZB7OUSU">Check out this ad </a>where women in bikinis run (with their breasts freely bouncing) from every corner of the globe, magnetically drawn to a man who is spraying himself with Axe fragrance. </span>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 21px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 21px; padding: 0px;">
  This kind of brand-hypocracy is not a new problem and it&#8217;s a growing phenomenon as companies buy up more and more existing brands. Consider that Fair Trade chocolate brand <a href="http://www.greenandblacks.com/">Green and Blacks</a> is owned by processed foods giant <a href="http://www.Kraftcanada.com">Kraft.</a> And that&#8217;s just the tip of the iceberg.

  How do you feel about a multinational speaking out of both sides of its mouth? Is it hypocritical or do you feel it&#8217;s better to use your dollars to vote for brands that carry positive social messages ?
