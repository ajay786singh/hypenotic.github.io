They&#8217;ll also help outfit your office with furniture and fixtures, and consult on further needs.

Sure a lot of people do extra-curricular stuff, but their moonlighting is totally inline with the story they&#8217;re trying to tell about themselves. And it&#8217;s a cool reminder that social media marketing is not strictly a digital process. They&#8217;ve injected themselves into the conversation handsomely. Put themselves in a position to travel by word of mouth and in bits. This post is proof.

I was there a couple of weeks ago, Met Tony, and envied what he&#8217;d created. Better prices for all the design paraphernalia alone makes their lifestyle attractive. He sheepishly but proudly displayed the spread where Office is covered in the October issue of How Magazine. 

Had me thinking about an Office YYZ there for a minute, but I think we&#8217;re on the road to manifesting our variation of a mix of experiences that becomes our marketing.
