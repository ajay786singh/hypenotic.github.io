If you&#8217;ve ever agreed to fill out a customer survey and then regretted giving up your precious time, maybe you should watch more movies.

My wife and I just watched our [first movie][1] on the newly-Canadian [Netflix.ca][2] this past Saturday. It was a welcome departure from my usual trek to [Blockbuster][3], where I get so overwhelmed by all the possibilities (hey &#8211; we don&#8217;t even have cable) that I dawdle, and my wife is too tired to watch by the time I get home.

The movie played without a hitch. As is typical, I dozed off mid-movie, to my wife&#8217;s chagrin. But I caught the missed bits on my iphone, while I waited for take-out the next day. (An entertaining new use for my &#8216;found&#8217; time.)

However, the most remarkable thing about Netflix so far has been the simplicity of the follow up. Today I got an email from Netflix inquiring about the picture and audio quality of their service.

> Dear [Rick],
> 
> You recently watched (500) Days of Summer. To help us ensure a great experience for all members, would you take a moment to tell us about the picture and audio quality?
> 
> *   The quality was very good
> *   The quality was acceptable
> *   The quality was unacceptable
> 
> Thanks for your help!
> 
> -Your friends at Netflix

I was genuinely taken aback by the remarkable restraint: A survey of just one question!

It&#8217;s nice to see a service both wants my feedback and respects my time.

Could it be that Netflix has learned that relationships are built over time? And that if they make it easy for me, I will happily share my likes and frustrations, ongoing?

Naturally, I clicked. I&#8217;m interested to see where this relationship is headed.

Which begs the question: Are there ways that you can make it easy for your customers to give you feedback that both respects their valued time, and enables you to serve them better? Tools like [this][4] and [this][5] might be a start. Know of any others?
