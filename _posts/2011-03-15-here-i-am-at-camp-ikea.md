IKEA has always been a very family friendly store. Amenities from parent parking spots to drop-off childcare centers (Småland) to stellar bathrooms with baby change stations put them in a category above all others.

During March Break IKEA is hosting a camp called &#8220;Camp IKEA&#8221; featuring face-painting, firemen, tree planting and more. It has inspired me to write a little song about what it must be like to be a kid at Camp IKEA.&#8221;



All good so far.

But for me, the name Camp IKEA takes this a bit too far. Even though all of the activities offered at IKEA during March Break require parent supervision, the name &#8216;Camp IKEA&#8217; is pushing some buttons and making me feel cynical.

It&#8217;s reminding me March Break is one of the few times that kids are out of school and available to hang out with their friends and their folks and have fun.  When you say &#8216;camp&#8217; I think of a place that is child-centered, not a grownup place that manages to keep kids amused while parents shop.<!--more-->

Frankly, the words &#8220;Camp&#8221; and &#8220;IKEA&#8221; together make it seem pathetic that parents would schlep their kids to IKEA during this particular week. In short, it&#8217;s making me more cynical than I want to be about IKEA&#8217;s intentions.

IKEA wants me to think nice, Swedish thoughts about equality, and love and goodness. I think a name like Smalstuff, or Smalfun would make IKEA seem like less of a shopping enabler and more like a helpful friend.

Happy March Break.
