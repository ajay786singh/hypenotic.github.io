**Planking 101**

I  recently heard about the growing internet craze known as “planking” where you stiffen your body into a plank position and have photos taken at strange locations. It&#8217;s so big there have even been[ &#8216;death by planking&#8217;][2] incidents, and it&#8217;s *sooooooo* big, that [Rosario Dawson planked on Jimmy Kimmel&#8217;s desk][3]!

The website [www.peopleplanking.com][4] is an online community for plankers which provides rules for proper planking and a forum for planking discussions. The community rates planking photos based on difficulty and outrageousness.  Location is also key; people are encouraged to add the GPS location of their plank, with countless photos showing &#8220;planks&#8221; on famous landmarks.

Dumbfounded by this craze, I probed to uncover its meaning and purpose. After asking countless people who partake in this bizarre activity and searching for answers online, I discovered that it&#8217;s simply one of those weird existential things; the only reason people do it, is to be a part of a community of like-minded people.

This got me thinking about planking&#8217;s potential as a force for good. Could planking be about more than a bunch of bored, narcissistic teens needing an outlet? I mean, dancing was just an amusement before FlashMobs showed up. Now dancing has a whole new purpose.

**Forward-Thinking Plankers**

****Turns out, there are lots of people using the powers of planking for good&#8211;and there are vital lessons we can take from it:

*   [Plank Society][5] uses planking as a means of raising awareness about breast cancer
*   75-year-old [Nancy][6] planks to draw attention to to recycling
*   [Casas por Cristo][7] planks to raise interest in engaging people to volunteer for mission trips
*   The Taiwanese [Pujie Girls][8] plank to promote travel to tourist locations, bring attention to the plight of stray animals, etc.
*   Other small groups are planking to raise money for [medical research][9], etc.

While it&#8217;s inherently meaningless, these groups have reinvented planking and harnessed its tremendous power.

**What These Socially Minded Plankers Can Teach Us**

*   People enjoy being a part of something bigger than themselves. We are programmed to crave community
*   Their loyalty to these communities and causes stretch far and wide- there&#8217;s no limit to the time, energy and money they&#8217;ll spend to continue being a part of it
*   Where there are communities of like-minded people, there is hope for creating social change

Given this, consider how you can tap into something people are already doing. Empowering an already active and connected community is a great- and yes, inexpensive- shortcut to drawing attention and gaining new audiences.

There&#8217;s no stopping these fad-happy-folks, so use them to your advantage- and ultimately to the advantage of the community as a whole- &#8217;cause heck, you may even have fun doing it!
