What better gift than passing on valuable knowledge so future mistakes can be avoided?

Filmmaker & photographer Andrew Zuckerman teamed up with Desmond Tutu to create the Wisdom Project. Both a book and movie, the project culls well known and interesting personalities [*real* people, not silly celebrities] in order to hear what they would pass on to future generations.

The film is beautifully shot and a must see, as is the Making Of doc and both are available on the website, [wisdombook.org][1]. They are fairly short, so take the time to grab a cup of tea, sit down and watch.
