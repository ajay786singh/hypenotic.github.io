While searching out content for this week&#8217;s Ontario Lake, I stumbled on this sweet & charming video of a family picking apples at Bass Lake. But that&#8217;s just where the story begins&#8230;.



The video features a woman named Ada Grexton and was posted by Jason Merling. I reached out to Jason on Facebook and Twitter and finally got his number through a mutual Facebook friend. What a world we live in where I can get the phone number of someone I only know through YouTube.

The Lake featured in the video is not actually called Bass Lake, it&#8217;s called Lake Aberdine, but folks who live around the lake named it for the amount of Bass you find there.It&#8217;s just south of Sault Ste. Marie.

Truth be told, it&#8217;s not the Bass Lake we intended to write about, but finding Jason and hearing his story made this the Bass Lake worth writing about.

The property was cleared (and therefore owned) by Jason&#8217;s great grandparents and became a family compound. It was a farm with many apple trees like the ones you see in the video. Today, all of the Apple Trees are gone, having succumbed to disease over the years.

But much of the property&#8217;s charm has been preserved. To this day there is no power or electricity on the property. Jason&#8217;s grandfather was an early &#8220;back to the land&#8221; thinker, and he would have wanted it that way. Another way the family acknowledges the significance of the property is by having a family reunion on the compound every July 1st. The highlight of the reunion is the &#8220;walk&#8221;&#8211;a 3-4 mile walk between the compound and the town of Leeburn. Some years as many as 100 family members take the walk that was taken by Ada Grexton featured n the video.

Special thanks to Jason Merling for taking the time to talk about Bass Lake.
