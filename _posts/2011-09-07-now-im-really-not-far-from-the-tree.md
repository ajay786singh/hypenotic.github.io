[Not Far From the Tree][1] sits right at the critical intersection of healthy food, climate change and social justice. *That&#8217;s* what makes them so unique.

The organization has a mission to harvest fruit trees from across Toronto. When volunteers pick fruit or tap trees for syrup they connect with their urban environment and their food in a whole new way. With 1/3 of the pick going to food banks and other hunger organizations volunteers also participate in helping  feed Toronto&#8217;s hungry.

Wonder why I&#8217;m gushing?

I&#8217;m particularly proud to let you know that I&#8217;m now a member on Not Far From the Tree&#8217;s new steering committee. What that means is not entirely clear yet. But, I&#8217;m delighted to be involved with this organization as it continues to do evolve and spread across Toronto.

NFFTT has accomplished an incredible amount in three short years. Here are some figures to give you a sense (of which there are many more in their [newly released yearbook][2])

*   30,0000 lbs of fruit picked by volunteers
*   700 volunteer fruit pickers
*   Donated fruit and syrup to 25 foodbanks, shelters and soup kitchens

And Founder and Director Laura Reinsborough knows that NFFTT is just scratching the surface. There are estimated to be 1.5 million lbs of food tucked away in homes and properties across Toronto. That&#8217;s a whole lot of potential&#8211;and alot of work&#8211;for one small but mighty  organization.

Enough chitter chatter. Let&#8217;s get to work!
