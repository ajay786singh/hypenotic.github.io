Have you been to [Mother&#8217;s Dumplings?][1] It&#8217;s an always packed Chinese dumpling, noodle and bun spot in the heart of Toronto&#8217;s China Town on Spadina Avenue. They have a very unassuming website, no Twitter presence and a very small following on Facebook. But Mother&#8217;s Dumplings taught me a very important lesson about social media.

One of the few elements (besides the dumplings) that Mother&#8217;s carried from their former &#8220;hole in the wall&#8221; digs to their new shiny location is a reverence for customer comments. Their walls were literally plastered with hand scrawled notes and drawings expressing an evangelical love of Mother&#8217;s dumplings.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-4755" href="http://hypenotic.com/meaning-fulmarketing/4713/what-a-dumpling-joint-taught-me-about-being-a-better-blogger/attachment/mothers1-3"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4755" title="Mothers1" src="http://hypenotic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Mothers12-e1303836138444-580x776.jpg" alt="" width="278" height="373" /></a>

Like many restaurants Mother&#8217;s provides comment cards and asks people to fill them in and provides a locked box to drop them in. [Swiss Chalet][2] does basically the same thing, nothing original there. So how does Mother&#8217;s manage to get so many comments?

I&#8217;ll tell you how: They frame them and hang them on the wall.

What does this insight reveal about generating more comments online? I&#8217;ve made the connection between [Problogger&#8217;s post on this subject][3] and the Mother&#8217;s Dumpling example.

**Invite comments**

You can leave it open ended by just having that blank &#8220;comments&#8221; box at the bottom of the blog post or you can actually ask people for their 2 cents by asking a question at the end of your post. The more you invite comments, the more likely you are to get them. Mother&#8217;s takes it one step further than Swiss Chalet by getting you to think about your comments while you&#8217;re still munching your smashed cucumber salad (which is divine by the way). ** **

**Interact with comments left/Reward Comments**

** **If someone takes the time to comment on your blog post you should take the time to respond. The most important thing this does, according to ProBlogger, is demonstrate that your comments section is &#8220;an active place that you as the blogger value.&#8221; In the case of Mother&#8217;s, I can&#8217;t think of a much better way of demonstrating appreciation for customer comments than framing and mounting them on the wall for all to see. ** **

**Be Humble**

** **This is an important one, and something that I hadn&#8217;t considered. If you seem like a know-it-all, then why would anyone bother to comment? If people fear they&#8217;ll be shut down it&#8217;s even more likely that they&#8217;ll stay silent. It&#8217;s a fine balance between positioning oneself as a leader and closing the door to interactivity&#8211;which is at the heart of social media. When Mother&#8217;s invites concerns or compliments you get the feeling that they really want to know how they can be better. Check out this blurb from their otherwise content light website:

> Ours is a cozy, welcoming café. If Zhen seems tired some days, it  is because she cooks her heart to make dumplings as good as her mother makes them.

What brings comments to your website? I&#8217;d love to hear what&#8217;s worked for you.
