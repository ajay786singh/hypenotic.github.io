The eagerly anticipated launch of Google+ Business pages has so far been met with  resounding &#8220;<a href="http://hypenotic.com/social-media-category/7523/google-pages-launches-another-social-media-space-to-look-after" target="_blank">So what?</a>&#8221; And right now I&#8217;d have to agree with that. The page set up is frustrating, the concept isn&#8217;t new or innovative and frankly it&#8217;s just another space for your community manager to post the same info as Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and Linked-In and Tumblr and Quora and possibly Storify, not to mention your blog.

As community managers we&#8217;re going to need to come up with another twist on posting in yet another conversational space without recycling the same old thing. And this is essentially, what the protesting is about. We don&#8217;t want to grow again because growth is hard especially in a space that is constantly asking for more. More information, more customer interaction, more transparency, deeper conversations, better ROI and we have to be funny, and we have to be topical and we have to be fast.  Faster than we&#8217;ve ever been, not to mention keeping up with the changes that being in all of those spaces forces on us every two to three months.

And the reason for all of those changes? New social media networking platforms, or changes to the relevant player platforms. Evolution of one causes the whole group to change. Evolve or become irrelevant (my_space, friendster, hi-5).

And so this is what leads me back to Google+ and how in a year from now (or even less) we&#8217;ll all be using it and working on more innovative and creative ways to utilize it.  Because I am sure by then that Google will have found a way change it and grow it into a fabulous tool in the social marketing space.  (See Google reader, Gmail, Google docs, <a href="http://www.wordstream.com/articles/google-failures-google-flops" target="_blank">ignore Google wave, Google buzz</a>).

And we all appreciate good tools to get in on the conversation our customers are already having, don&#8217;t we?
