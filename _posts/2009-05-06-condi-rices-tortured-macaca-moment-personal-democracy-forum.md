&#8220;Condi Rice&#8217;s Tortured Macaca Moment&#8221; via [Personal Democracy Forum][1].

Cool commentary on a simple question period with Condoleeza Rice, Stanford students, and a video camera that result in mainstream media attention, public contribution/clarification and information that was all arguably unattainable by reporters while her administration was in office.

The post references a [Harper&#8217;s article][2] by Scott Horton that deconstructs Condi&#8217;s comments as well.
