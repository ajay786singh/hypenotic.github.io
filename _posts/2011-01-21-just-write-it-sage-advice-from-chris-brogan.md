I found this from [Chris Brogan][1] in my inbox this morning. His newsletter is great. And, if this doesn&#8217;t motivate you to blog more often (or at all) I don&#8217;t know what will.

**Perfect Kills Published**

The best sentences don’t sell books (or magazines or whatever). A string of reasonably not bad sentences with useful and engaging information sells books. My books are NOT the best-written books out there on their topic. They’re well-marketed books that I put some soul and heart into. Is every sentence just so? Not even a little bit. But am I a New York Times bestselling author? Oh yes I am. Because I published.

That’s the only difference between where a lot of writers are and where I am: I published.

How? I write. I write all the time. I’m writing this at Walt Disney World, when I should be riding on the Tower of Terror or something. Yes, I do take time to stop and smell the roses, but I don’t neglect my duties. It’s part of what I do. Write. Get writing. Stop making excuses, and don’t look back.

Your successful writing future awaits. Just get publishing.
