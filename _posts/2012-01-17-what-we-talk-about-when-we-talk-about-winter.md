Weather affects how we dress, how we transport and how we feel every day. Especially during winter, it is impossible to forget the fact that it is ten degrees below zero or to ignore that the wind-chill can make it feel even worse.

    I am Mexican, so this is only the third real winter I’ve experience in my life. For me every aspect of winter is a novelty. Whenever I go back home I find myself trying to explain to people how cold feels like up here. I end up using analogies and saying things like:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Sometimes the cold air is very aggressive and feels like it punches you in the face as soon as you get out of your house. When it gets really bad I feel like my life is actually in danger. After some months of winter I start doubting that that trees will be green again and that flowers will grow underneath the piles of snow, I feel hopeless. When winter is finally over I wonder if I could ever go through it again, then I go out to enjoy every minute of sun and heat I can get and promise never to complain if it feels too hot.
    </p>

    Lots of feelings get stirred up during winter so instead of suffering them I decided to observe them and express them in a project. I’m calling this project <a href="http://angelykke.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">100+ Days of Winter</a>; my intention is to create a visual diary of the winter using graphic design. I’m interested in watching the weather change little by little and documenting it for a hundred days by showing its numbers and the feelings associated with them. It is also revealing how our perspective changes depending on the context, for example a day of -6 after a day of -26 feels like such a relief it brings positive feelings, it feels <a href="http://angelykke.tumblr.com/post/15325909138/january4" target="_blank">like a picnic</a>!

    Many times ideas come flowing form random conversations, with people I ran into in the elevator or at the office, transforming the so-called “small talk” into fuel for creativity.

    I&#8217;m only at day 11 so far, so please <a href="http://angelykke.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">take a look</a>, tell me what you think and more importantly, how does it feel today?
